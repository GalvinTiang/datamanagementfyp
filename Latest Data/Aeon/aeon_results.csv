Damn Nippon.","Dec 5, 2018 10:20 AM","commonsense","In term of financials the company actually did not do that bad in 3Q18. But i think some investors might have assume that they would have made higher profit than the RM13.9 mil recorded given that there was the tax holiday period.
4Q18 should post both higher revenue and profit vs 3Q but might be difficult to beat last year's result. 4Q17 PBT was the highest profit recorded per quarter since 2015.
The issue with the company lies mainly on its valuation. At the current share price it is already valued at 25.6x PE. Companies at this valuation normally offers investors profit growth of at least 20% (PAT in FY17 was RM100mil). Even if they do managed to record a profit of RM120mil in FY18, that would still translate to a PE of 19.4x. Still high but if the growth of 20% is consistent, by FY21 PAT should be RM200mil which helps bring down the valuation to 12.8x PE.
Given current market condition, there are actually a lot of companies that currently trade at low PE multiple but can still provide profit growth in the short to mid term.
One company that you can consider for your portfolio is MBMR.
The company is a direct proxy to Perodua via its 22.6% interest in the company. Valuation is cheap at only 5.3x PE (based on target FY18 PATAMI of RM145mil. 9m PATAMI is already RM106mil). PB is low at only 0.5x BV. 4Q18 results is expected to be higher than 3Q18 and last year 4Q17. And FY19 growth will be driven by the still high demand of new Myvi and the launch of the new SUV in 1Q19.
Please go through the analyst reports (https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/stk/pt/5983.jsp) and do your own analysis before making any decisions.
Hope earning growth for Aeon will accelerate in a much faster rate in the future in order to commensurate investors for the high valuation at the moment.

Corporate Profile
AEON CO. (M) BHD. (AEON or the Company) was incorporated on 15 September 1984. AEON was set up in response to the Malaysian Government’s invitation to AEON Japan to help modernise the retailing industries in Malaysia. The ‘AEON’ name today is well established among Malaysians as well as foreigners, especially due to its association with the international AEON Group of Companies. AEON has established itself as a leading chain of General Merchandise Stores (GMS) and supermarkets. AEON’s constant interior refurbishment of stores to project an image designed to satisfy the ever changing needs and desires of consumers is clear evidence of this. The Company’s performance has been further enhanced by the management’s acute understanding of target market needs and the provision of an optimal product mix. AEON’s stores are mostly situated in suburban residential areas, catering to Malaysia’s vast middle income group. The AEON Group of Companies consists of AEON Co., Ltd. and about 300 consolidated subsidiaries and affiliated companies.
In addition to its core GMS plus its supermarket and convenience store operations, AEON is also active in specialty store operations, shopping centre development and operations, credit card business and services. The AEON Group of Companies is an integrated Japanese retailer and is active not only in Japan but also throughout ASEAN and China. At all times, in every market, AEON’s activities are guided by its unchanging ‘Customer First’ philosophy. Its aim is to surpass expectations by combining excellent products with unique personal services that enhance the shopping experience to make customers smile every time they shop.","Feb 22, 2019 11:50 AM","Good123",":)

Aeon plans foray into on-demand delivery services
24 JAN 2018 / 21:39 H.
KUALA LUMPUR: Aeon Co (M) Bhd today signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Singapore-based online concierge and delivery service, honestbee, to venture into on-demand delivery services.
This new delivery option, which uses personal shoppers to pick up and deliver orders, will enable Aeon customers to make their purchases online, via honestbee mobile app or website.
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Aeon executive director Poh Ying Loo said the alliance is part of the group’s strategy to speed up its e-commerce business and at the same time add value to its outlets.
Aeon joined the e-commerce bandwagon in late 2015 through its online website called shoppu.com.my, offering various product categories including electronics, fashion and household items.
Asked on how this new service will help to elevate its e-commerce sales growth, Poh said at this point of time, it is still early to determine. It was reported that the group’s online website shoppu.com.my contribution in financial year 2016 (FY16) remained marginal.
For now, Poh said the new online marketplace platform will only offer delivery service for grocery items at its flagship store, Aeon Mid Valley. He said customer who live within 17km radius from the store will enjoy a minimum one-hour delivery service.
Commenting on its future plans for e-commerce segment, Aeon managing director Shinobu Washizawa said going forward, the group will have more such innovations in the pipeline.
“In order to enhance the value for our customers by moving towards an omni-channel retailer, we want to combine our strengths with honestbee’s expertise to digitalise our customer’s shopping experience.”
“We will closely monitor the feedback and demands from our customers, and consider to expand this service both in terms of regional and in merchandise offering,” Washizawa added.
At present, Aeon has 26 malls, 33 Aeon outlets and two Maxvalu prime supermarkets across the country.
Launched in 2015, honestbee currently has presence in eight markets including Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. To date, it has 112 partners, providing more than 90,000 products across the markets.","Feb 22, 2019 2:47 PM","Victor Yong","Rm1.39 + RM2.65 / 2 = Rm2.02 VERY CLOSE TO ITS AVERAGE TARGET PRICE AS SHOWN BELOW :)

Close
FY18 CNP of RM124.5m (+17%) came in within our forecast at 105%, but above consensus expectation at 119%, of full-year estimates. The group opened a new AEON mall in Kuching, Sarawak in 2Q18 and another one in Negeri Sembilan in Jan 2019. The group has allocated RM400m capex for FY19 (FY18: RM400m) for the construction of the new mall and renovation of existing malls. No changes to our FY19E CNP. Reiterate OP with unchanged TP of RM2.00.
FY18 within our expectation. FY18 CNP of RM124.5m (+17%) came in within our forecast at 105%, but above consensus expectation at 119%, of full year-estimates. The FY18 CNP excludes a one-off recognition for divestment of an associates, Index Living Mall Malaysia Sdn Bhd (ILMM), with impairment loss of RM8.0m and share of 1H18 operating loss of RM11.4m. ILMM is a joint-venture company (51%/49%) between AEON and Index Living Mall Company Limited (ILM). A final DPS of 4.0 sen (FY17:4.0 sen) was declared for FY18, as expected.
YoY, FY18 CNP rose 17% mainly due to higher sales (+6%) with stronger performance in Retailing business division (+10%) and Property Management division (+4%). The positive growth was attributed to higher contribution from new AEON Mall Kuching (opened in 2Q18) and supported by the stronger contribution from new mall opened last year (AEON Kempas, Johor) as well as shopping malls that were renovated and expanded. Additionally, the effective tax rate was also lower at 43.8% (FY17: 45.8%)
QoQ, 4Q18 CNP surged 287%, despite the slower sales growth (+4%), mainly from expanded EBIT margin by 5.5ppt to 8.7% from 3.2% in 3Q18 due to lower base in 3Q as AEON absorbed the SST pricing impact, locking the zero-rated pricing only for September 2018 (SST tax percentage brackets are varied based on products, effective 1st
September 2018). Note that, 3Q is historically the weakest quarter for the group, without any festivities to boost sales, as compared to 4Q which are boosted by year-end promotional activities. Furthermore, the effective tax rate was also lower at 37.1% (3Q18: 40.8%)
Outlook. Management highlighted that for retailing space, they would continue to refurbish selected stores and employ appropriate marketing and pricing strategies, merchandise assortment reformation, maintaining quality customer service and further expand its ecommerce presence. For property management services, they expect the occupancy rate and rental rates to remain challenging. AEON will continue to leverage on its competitive strengths to draw customer traffic to its malls so as to maintain its position as a popular shopping destination. The group has opened new AEON mall in Kuching, Sarawak in 2Q18 and another one in Negeri Sembilan in January 2019. The group has allocated RM400m capex for FY18/FY19 (FY17: RM500m) for the construction of the new mall and renovation of existing malls.
Maintain OUTPERFORM with an unchanged TP of RM2.00 based on 21x FY19E EPS, at -1.0SD of its 5-year historical mean PER.We like AEON for its: (i) dual income streams, which are less vulnerable to price changes during implementation of the new SST, and (ii) on-going operations restructuring, improving margin for retailing, and sustained property income. Risks to our call include: (i) lower-than-expected sales, and (ii) higherthan-expected operating expenses.

The PrimeWin RM1,000,000 CASA-i will run from now until April 30, 2020, and is open to the bank's savings and current account holders.
The campaign carries a grand prize of RM1 million and total cash prizes worth close to RM2 million.
Depositors have an opportunity to win the cash prize through the financial institution's monthly and quarterly draws throughout the campaign period.
""With this campaign, we will be able to reward our current customers as well as draw new customers to experience banking with MBSB Bank,"" said its group president and chief executive Datuk Seri Ahmad Zaini Othman.
Ahmad Zaini said the bank will be implementing further digitalisation of its operations, which includes introducing mobile application and digital branches to its customers.
It will also introduce its first debit card, the MBSB Bank Visa Debit Card-i.
On the relocation of its headquarters to PJ Sentral, Ahmad Zaini said: ""The new building has our employees' best interests in mind. Not only is it a green building, it will have an activity-based workplace concept, a working environment that allows for collaborative workspace, (and) creative engagement resulting in a happy and productive workforce.""
""It will also be equipped with a creche, a facility that is not embraced widely by most companies in Malaysia,"" he added.

（吉隆坡26日讯）归功于新翻修商店和新店开业提振收入，以及联号公司亏损减少，带动永旺（AEON,6599,主板消费产品服务组）截至2019年6月30日第二季净利增长98.75%至1945万4000令吉，拉高上半年净利38.06%至5209万令吉。
次季营业额起3.33%至10亿9948万6000令吉，提振6个月营业额5.88%至23亿零636万2000令吉。
展望未来，永旺透过文告表示，大马经济在内忧外患困扰下料转疲，因此董事部预期现财政年表现将持续充满挑战。
以零售业务来看，永旺将继续翻新特定店铺，以及采用合适的行销与定价策略、商品分类改革、维持优质客户服务和营运效率来确保核心业务持续受惠。
产业管理服务方面，该公司预期出租率和租金将持续严峻，但将继续善用竞争优势来引导消费客群进入商场，以维持购物首选地位。","Aug 28, 2019 7:02 PM","HoldingKing","Aeon profit up drop more than 10%, Padini profit drop but up 8%.

The motor vehicles’ sub-sector contributed the most to this increase at RM6.8 billion, an increase of RM6.0 billion or 709.0 per cent m-o-m.
KUALA LUMPUR: Wholesale and retail trade rose by RM17.5 billion or 26.3 per cent month-on-month (m-o-m) to RM84.4 billion in May 2020 compared to April 2020.
Chief statistician Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Uzir Mahidin said this was due to the reopening of almost all economic sectors and business activities starting May 4, under the Conditional Movement Control Order.
""The motor vehicles’ sub-sector contributed the most to this increase at RM6.8 billion, an increase of RM6.0 billion or 709.0 per cent m-o-m.
""This was followed by retail trade which rose RM8.6 billion or 30.5 per cent m-o-m to RM36.9 billion, and wholesale trade, which expanded by RM3.0 billion or 8.0 per cent m-o-m to RM40.7 billion, ” he said in a statement today.
Meanwhile, online retail sales grew by 9.3 per cent m-o-m and expanded 39.3 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y).
Mohd Uzir said despite the positive m-o-m growth, sales of wholesale and retail trade contracted by 23.8 per cent y-o-y, the third consecutive y-o-y decline after March 2020 and April 2020.
""Wholesale trade sub-sector registered the biggest fall among sub-sectors with RM12.6 billion or -23.6 per cent y-o-y.
""Similarly, retail trade decreased RM7.2 billion or -16.2 per cent y-o-y while motor vehicles was also down RM6.6 billion or -49.5 per cent y-o-y, ” he said.
In terms of volume, wholesale and retail trade rose 30.3 per cent m-o-m in May 2020 due to the 763.3 per cent growth in the motor vehicle sub-sector, said Mohd Uzir.
""Retail trade and wholesale trade also posted positive growth of 32.9 per cent m-o-m and 12.0 per cent m-o-m respectively during the month, ” he added. - Bernama","Jul 9, 2020 3:49 PM","Good123","steady... mainly owned by institutional investors. not influenced by retailers","Jul 9, 2020 4:01 PM","Victor Yong","ROBUST consumer spending and improved sentiment arising from the implementation of the stimulus package during the pandemic.","Jul 9, 2020 4:04 PM","Victor Yong","Along with the spillover effect from the lower OPR, has seen the traditional defensive stocks such as Aeon Co (M) Bhd, investors especially EPF became more confident over the financial prospects for one of the country's largest retailing groups and continues to buy more and more aeon shares recently .

The COVID-19 outbreak declared as a pandemic by World Health Organisation has impacted the economy,
both globally and domestically including retail industry sector. The Government has provided various
economic stimulus packages to continue supporting businesses.
Under such challenging environment, while the Company experienced business interruptions to its core
businesses during MCO period, the Company has actively taken pro-active business initiatives and operational
measures including austerity cost measures, customer safety measures as well as welfare of its employees to

Support: RM1.00
Stop Loss: RM0.960
Possible for recovery. AEON remained resilient despite market weakness. Corresponding RSI and MACD indicators remain healthy while trending sideways, with anticipation of continuous improvement in both momentum and trend in the near term. Should resistance level of RM1.10 be genuinely broken with renewed buying interest, it may continue to lift price higher to subsequent resistance level of RM1.19.
However, failure to hold on to support level of RM1.00 may indicate weakness in the share price and hence, a cut-loss signal.

Of the 28 stores in Malaysia, half of it are fully owned (the land and the building), another 10 are leased, and another 4, they own the building rent the land. Since 2015, the big borrowings was because they wanted to refurbish its existing malls and complete its new shopping mall. Start from 2019, they adopt new reporting standard that the rent expense is being capitalised instead of simply recognised as lease expenditure in income statement. That’s why we see a huge figure in lease liabilities, the present value of future lease payments and the right of use of assets, it’s a pair. As a hypermarket, net profit margin 2-3% is normal, Aeon is in the range, they need high volume and less margin. And obviously it has dropped from 2.7% to 0.6%. which business not being affected by pandemic other than gloves and healthcare sector though?

KUALA LUMPUR (July 20): Malaysia’s economy may be severely impacted if the movement control order (MCO) is re-imposed, says Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin.
The premier noted that the country’s daily Covid-19 infections have risen to double-digit levels over the last few days, with 13 new clusters discovered throughout the current recovery MCO (RMCO) period, which began on June 10.
“If there is a spike in new Covid-19 cases, this will prompt the government to reimplement the MCO, (which in turn will have a) massive impact on our economy. The closing of economic sectors can cause the country to lose at least RM2 billion per day and millions of workers to lose their income sources,” he said in a live televised speech today.
“All the government and non-governmental organisations’ efforts under the Penjana and Prihatin [stimulus] packages to revive the economy will go to waste. The Prihatin package is expected to contribute over 3% to the country’s GDP (gross domestic product) this year,” he added.

AEON Big Subang to operate as usual despite court hearing
Thursday, July 16th, 2020 at , Business | News
by PRIYA VASU/ pic credit: aeonbig.com.my
JAPANESE retailer AEON Big’s store in Subang Jaya, Selangor, will continue operating as usual after it was temporarily sealed on Tuesday for failing to settle a judgement sum of RM142 million.
The Alor Setar High Court has stated the execution of the judgement in default dated June 9, 2020, said AEON Big (M) Sdn Bhd in a statement.
The hearing to set aside the judgement in default for the sum of RM142 million made against the company has been fixed on Aug 6, 2020.
AEON Big had obtained the High Court Declaration from the Penang High Court in November last year to declare the agreement signed between AEON Big and Mega Continental Sdn Bhd.
Mega Continental prompted the suit against AEON Big after the retailer vacated the store in Alor Setar, Kedah, ahead of its lease expiration day.
Details on the dispute between these two companies are unclear. An attempt by The Malaysian Reserve to get clarification on the matter was not responded to.
On Tuesday, The Edge Markets reported the store’s last day of operation was on June 10. The publication also wrote the management of AEON Co Ltd’s retail units — AEON Co (M) Bhd and AEON Big — were being restructured and consolidated into a single organisation as part of a 10-year strategy to create an agile, resilient and intrapreneurial retail organisation.
This management reorganisation would involve the loss-making AEON Big relocating its offices from Subang Jaya to AEON Co’s headquarters at Taman Maluri, Kuala Lumpur.
In the statement yesterday, the retailer further said: “There are many important issues the company should be looking at, such as preserving economic sustainability, protecting public health and providing continuous employment to the people. AEON Big is committed to continue to move forward with great confidence.”
The company is scheduled to open its 22nd store in Malaysia at Jaya One in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, on July 23 with a net lettable area of 41,527 sq ft store, which targets to provide about 150 employments.
The company further stated that the country is facing an unprecedented global health pandemic and domestic economic crisis. “It is important to focus on building the businesses and help revive the economy despite experiencing a very challenging year due to Covid-19.
The management has turned the company to become profitable for the first half of 2020, compared to previous years since taking over the stores from Carrefour in 2012. With continuous support from our staff, vendors and suppliers, AEON Big believes that this strong performance will continue throughout 2020,” it added.
AEON posted RM1.02 billion for its retail business segment for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, lower by 0.9% compared to RM1.03 billion recorded in the previous year’s corresponding quarter, mainly due to lower general merchandise sales (GMS) recorded especially during the Movement Control Order (MCO) period, whereby GMS were not allowed to operate.
Revenue from its property management services segment for the quarter at RM169 million was lower by 3.6%, over the previous year’s corresponding quarter of RM175.2 million.
The shortfall in revenue was mainly due to lower sales commission receivable from tenants, especially during the MCO period where non-essential services tenants were not allowed to operate.
The segmental profit of RM55.7 million was lower compared to RM66.9 million recorded in the previous year mainly due to the same reasons. Its share price closed at 97 sen yesterday, giving it a market capitalisation of US$1.3 billion (RM5.59 billion)."

Malaysia’s economy grew 4.3 per cent in 2019 with the slowest
pace in the fourth quarter of the year at 3.6 per cent from the
softening global demand and the United States-China trade
war. Consumer sentiments remained subdued amid rising cost
of living concerns, and continuous uncertainties in business
outlook and employment.
For 2019, the Company continued to record growth in its
performance with a revenue registered at RM4.539 billion or an
increase of 4.3% for the financial year (FY) ended 31 December
2019 over FY2018. The higher revenue was mainly due to
revenue contributions from newly renovated stores and newly
opened specialty stores during the year under review, as well as
new stores which were opened in April 2018 and January 2019.
The higher growth was however mitigated by the temporary
closure of stores for renovation during the year under review and
the downsizing of a store at the end of previous year.
The Company’s profit before tax for the year of RM196.9 million
was 5.3% higher than the previous financial year of RM187.0
million. At net profit level, the Company recorded a better
profit after tax of RM109.2 million for the year under review,
as compared to the previous year of RM105.1 million, or an
increase of 3.9%.
The retail business segment at a revenue of RM3.832 billion
in FY2019, registered a good growth of 4.5% over preceding
year with a corresponding much improved retailing profit of
RM114.6 million compared to previous year of RM51.7 million.
The higher revenue were mainly due to the contributions from
newly renovated stores and newly opened stores in April 2018
and January 2019 as well as newly opened specialty stores
in 2019. As for the better profit achievement, besides higher
revenue, it was also due to margin improvement and a result of
change in marketing strategies, assortment and pricing under
the competitive market.
In FY2019, the Company continued to strategically refurbish
its existing stores in order to enhance its customers shopping
experience. During the year under review, the Company
refurbished and opened its newly renovated stores in Bandar
Utama and Taman Maluri shopping centre.
The property management services segment‘s revenue of
RM706.6 million represented a growth of 2.8% over FY2018
mainly due to contributions from new mall openings. It recorded a
segmental profit of RM268.7 million which was higher compared
to RM209.8 million in FY2018, mainly due to the higher revenue. As at 31 December 2019, the Company’s shareholders’ fund,
remained strong at RM1.695 billion with a net asset value per
share of RM1.21 (FY2018: RM1.44) and an earnings per share
of 7.78 sen (FY2018: 7.49 sen). As at financial year ended, the
Company’s borrowings at RM928.6 million (FY 2018: RM995.42
million) remained manageable.","Jul 24, 2020 8:34 AM","Good123","Senior Management

I am sorry for late reply and thank you for dropping email.
To answer your question it used to be like that.
However, now we focus on making operation cash flow as we reduce a lot of merchandise stock at store, improvement for cash collection from tenant and cost improvement through group synergies with AEONBIG.
Therefore, we pay dividends from those improvements.
I hope I answer your question.

LONDON: British retail sales jumped back almost to pre-coronavirus lockdown levels in June when non-essential stores in England reopened, giving a boost to beleaguered clothing stores.
Sales volumes in June leapt by 13.9% from May, above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.
A 70% surge in clothing and footwear sales reversed much of their slump in recent months, though the sector remains one of the worst hit, with spending 35% below pre-pandemic levels.
Overall sales volumes rose to within 0.6% of February's level. Excluding fuel sales, hit by less commuting and other travel, volumes were 2.4% higher than in February.
Household goods stores also saw strong sales in June especially for furniture and DIY materials. Home improvement retailer Kingfisher this week forecast first-half underlying profit ahead of last year after exceptionally strong demand.
Retail sales represent only about a third of consumer spending, however, and other figures suggest people remain cautious about returning to places like bars and restaurants.
""The surge in retail sales volumes... in June is not a sign that households' overall spending also is recovering fully and rapidly,"" said Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
Britain's economy shrank by more than a quarter in March and April and only recovered slightly in May when there was a limited relaxation of the lockdown imposed on March 23.
The Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, says payments data has suggested a rapid, V-shaped recovery though many of his colleagues are doubtful about a sustained recovery.
The British Retail Consortium said earlier this month that spending among its members - typically large high-street chains - was 3.4% higher this June than last year.
Friday's figures showed that retail sales slumped by a record 9.5% in the second quarter compared to the first.
Compared with June 2019, sales were down 1.6%, a smaller fall than 6.4% seen in the Reuters poll.
Online spending, which soared at the start of the lockdown, fell as a share of overall spending as shoppers in England were able to return to stores from June 15 onwards. But at 31.8%, it remained much higher than February's 20%.
Consumer sentiment is still well below its level before the coronavirus struck Britain and cafes and restaurants have reported subdued demand since they reopened on July 4.
More than 45,000 people with COVID-19 have died in Britain, Europe's highest death toll. BoE policymaker Jonathan Haskel said on Thursday that persistent health worries as well as a jump in unemployment risked halting the recovery. - Reuters","Jul 25, 2020 4:01 PM","Good123","DEALINGS IN LISTED SECURITIES (CHAPTER 14 OF LISTING REQUIREMENTS) : DEALINGS OUTSIDE CLOSED PERIOD

￼￼
￼BY Justin ON JULY 17, 2020
Officially embraced the trend of online shopping by jumping onboard e-commerce platforms.
The Japanese franchise announced its online store in Shopee late last month. This allows you to shop from the comfort of your own home without having to drive out.
Just like Daiso stores in Malaysia, many of its products are priced at RM5.90. Although the online store may not have every product from its physical store, there is still a wide variety of items sold on Shopee.
The categories available are housewares, toys, mobile accessories, kitchen and dining tools, beauty items, groceries and pets, as well as stationery – just to name a few. In light of the Covid-19 outbreak, shopping online without the need to queue is certainly a bonus.","Jul 27, 2020 8:39 AM","Good123","Department store and supermarket operator AEON Co (M) Bhd, however, is still rated a “buy”, favoured by five out of eight analysts who cover the stock, Bloomberg data shows.
RHB Research likes the fact that AEON is transforming its shopping malls to adapt to changing consumer demand. In a Nov 29 note, it pointed out that AEON’s valuations are undemanding in view of its growth potential and status as the largest shariah-compliant mall operator in Malaysia.","Jul 27, 2020 8:40 AM","Good123","In a recent interview with The Edge, AEON executive director Poh Ying Loo acknowledges the tough retail climate amid waning consumer sentiment not just in Malaysia but also globally.
“Consumer sentiment has been affected by factors such as the higher cost of living, which impacts purchasing power. However, for us, this is not something surprising as AEON has been in Malaysia over the past 30 years, and we have gone through a few downturns, such as during the 1985 [recession], the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis and the 2009 global financial crisis.
“We have also experienced the tough times the retail sector has gone through, where we have seen some of our competitors consolidating while others have shut down their operations,” he says.
Currently, AEON operates 35 outlets, 28 malls, 74 Wellness pharmacies, 42 Daiso stores and six MaxValu Prime supermarkets.
Around half of AEON’s revenue is derived from its supermarkets, while its department stores and other concept stores make up the rest.
“This year, we are looking to open at least two more MaxValu stores. As for major openings [of outlets and malls], that would probably take place in 2021. We may also look at closing one or two smaller format stores this year but this would not impact our operations.
“We will also continue to refurbish some of our selected stores and malls. Some of these stores and malls are due for an upgrade and refurbishment as they age. We have in recent times refurbished our stores in Queensbay, Tebrau City, Bandar Utama and Taman Maluri, and you can see that whenever we make changes [to our stores], they attract more customers.
“We also have the competitive advantage in the sense that we manage and operate the malls, so we are able to leverage the synergies of the core businesses that we have,” Poh says.
He believes the department store model is still relevant but that technology and social media are needed to create a certain perception of the store and business so that they appeal to the younger generation.
“Department stores can still be relevant in the current environment, but they have to be tweaked to match the current consumer lifestyle.
“Of course, this has to be backed by the correct assortment of merchandise that will be more suitable for the younger generation. There is always the need to refurbish, upgrade and change the layout of our stores, otherwise they look tired. No matter how loyal a customer is, if there are no changes or enhancements made, we will not see an increase in footfall,” he says.
In its efforts to penetrate the e-commerce space, AEON Malaysia has a partnership with online grocery delivery company HappyFresh as well as popular e-commerce platform Shopee.
As for the adoption of the new standard on leases under MFRS 16, Poh says it does have an impact on the company as almost half of its outlets are on lease. “The impact will normalise after a certain number of years as it is more profound during the initial part of the lease.”
On Jan 1, the group appointed Shafie Shamsuddin as its new managing director, replacing Shinobu Washizawa. Shafie had worked with French retailer Carrefour Group for over 16 years and was the managing director of Carrefour Singapore, Carrefour Malaysia and Carrefour Indonesia between 2005 and 2011 before he was appointed executive director of global talent management and organisational development at Carrefour Group.
Prior to joining AEON, he was CEO and president of the board of directors of PT Trans Retail Indonesia.","Jul 27, 2020 8:43 AM","Good123","In its efforts to penetrate the e-commerce space, AEON Malaysia has a partnership with online grocery delivery company HappyFresh as well as popular e-commerce platform Shopee.","Jul 27, 2020 1:01 PM","B A","AEON Target price before 2021, RM0.70, inevitable.","Jul 27, 2020 7:18 PM","Hope123","Aeon target price 1.29 by 31st Dec 2020.","Jul 28, 2020 10:10 AM","B A","AEON 0.800 next week","Jul 29, 2020 11:26 AM","Knowolf","Target end of August 0.90","Jul 30, 2020 11:54 AM","Jeffreyteck","Only trading play may push up as fundamentals = 0 as it does not have any competitive edge under the current competition environment.

As for the retail sector, the retail sales trend is expected to gradually improve moving forward with further easing of restrictions during the current recovery phase of MCO. Shopping malls and retailers are also expected to embrace technological innovations, with a focus on less contact with surfaces and among people.
“We expect to see more creative ideas and trends that embrace technological innovations in the retail industry. The short-term outlook for the sector remains cloudy but there are windows of opportunity in the mid to longer term with the right data, key insights and value,” said the report.
In the meantime, the booming e-commerce business appears to be a silver lining in the current crisis, accelerating the sales of consumer goods through online channels, it said.

Aeon Co - Ripe for the Pickings
Date: 29/07/2020
Source : AffinHwangStock : AEON Price Target : 1.00 | Price Call : BUY Last Price : 0.825 | Upside/Downside : ￼ 0.175 (21.21%) Back
We hosted a virtual meeting with Aeon Co’s management recently, attended by over 20 local institutional investors.
Key takeaways: For July month-to-date: (i) retailing saw strong recovery since RMCO, overall sales trended higher yoy; and (ii) rental income has gradually recovered since April, now near 85% of pre-Covid level.
Given a likely strong pent-up recovery in 2021 (assuming no major second Covid-19 outbreak), we upgrade Aeon to BUY (from Hold) albeit with a slightly lower 12-month TP of RM1.00, based on 15.5x 2021 EPS.
Retail segment staging strong recovery since RMCO
For the retailing segment, management indicated that overall sales are staging a strong recovery since the RMCO, notching up yoy growth in July month-to-date (MTD) – largely led by the softline and foodline segments. Geographically, retail businesses in the group’s Northern and Central regions saw encouraging growth yoy whilst the Southern region is still lagging slightly behind in terms of recovery.
Rental rebates likely to gradually dissipate in 2H20
Aeon granted rental rebates to deserving tenants in non-essential businesses (c.70% of total tenants) over the lockdown period. Following a trough in April’s rental income, we gather that collection has recovered MoM and reached c.85% of the pre-Covid rental income of c.RM58m/month. Barring a recurrence of the MCO, rental relief, if any, will likely be minimal and on a case-to-case basis in 2H20.

SHAH ALAM (Aug 6): The country's online food delivery service market is expected to grow 17.9 percent annually to reach revenue of US$370 million in four years, said Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Economy) Datuk Seri Mustapa Mohamed.
He said the growth projection was made in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic that had transformed the people's lifestyle to a new normal, with many activities now being conducted online, including food ordering.
Citing data from Statista Market Forecast (2020), he said Malaysia's online food delivery market was valued at US$192 million at present, comprising 6.2 million consumers.
""The biggest segment contributing to the growth of the industry is targeted to be restaurant-to-customer delivery, which accounts for US$137 million compared to US$55 million for platform-to-customer delivery segment.
“The food delivery industry, which is part of the gig economy, should be based on the digitalisation concept. It is at the top of the government's agenda in the medium to long-term economic recovery plan currently being drawn up by the Economic Planning Unit and the Economic Action Council,” he said in his speech for the AEON rider motorcycle handover ceremony here today.
The text of his speech was read by Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Economy) Arthur Joseph Kurup.
Mustapa said the medium to long-term economic recovery plan, to be announced by October, would look at the renewal of the job market, issue of quality investments and digital economy.
At today's function, AEON Malaysia, through the Malaysian AEON Foundation (MAF), donated 300 motorcycles for the AEON Rider Project to create employment for those who lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
AEON Retail Malaysia chief executive officer Shafie Shamsuddin said the company launched the initiative to help individuals affected by the pandemic, and even provided the motorcycles for the riders.

Aeon Co chief executive officer for Asean Nagahisa Oyama said yesterday: ‘I will be sending a message to all employees of Carrefour Malaysia which expresses our intention to retain all of them.’
KUALA LUMPUR: In a move that surprised market watchers, Japan's largest retailer Aeon Co￼ Ltd will swallow Carrefour's Malaysian operations on its own without the involvement of its locally-listed entities Aeon Co (M) Bhd (Aeon Malaysia) and AEON Credit Service (M) Bhd￼.
The deal thus has no financial impact on Aeon Co's Malaysian subsidiaries as they will be run separately from the newly-acquired Carrefour Malaysia, said Aeon Co chief executive officer for Asean Nagahisa Oyama, but it is expected to produce synergies in aspects such as information technology (IT), distribution network and product development.","Aug 7, 2020 7:28 AM","Benlee88888","Today got hope?","Aug 7, 2020 7:33 AM","apple168","KL counterparts heard that aeon will be one of the covid19 vaccine distributors/ sellers... buy at your own risk...","Aug 7, 2020 7:36 AM","Good123","The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.68% and the S","Aug 7, 2020 7:52 AM","Good123","aeon's turn, bila? ￼
The local stock marketgained 6.8%month-on-month inJuly, thankstoglove makers’ strongrally. Giventhe sharpgainsinthe pastfourmonths,howwill Augustlooklikeand whatare the events towatch out for?
PETALING JAYA: Amid the positive market momentum, 54 companies hit their 52-week highs yesterday on Bursa Malaysia.
A large number of companies across the board also hit limit up, with their share prices gaining more than 30%.
The benchmark FBM KLCI closed higher by 20.44 points or 1.3% to 1,588.57.
Volume hit fresh record high at 16.68 billion shares worth RM8.56bil, compared with Wednesday’s 15.57 billion shares worth RM8.26bil. The market breadth was positive with 716 gainers outnumbering 468 losers.
While the index posted its fourth consecutive month of gain in July, driven by strong liquidity and the rally of glove stocks on expectations of positive earnings momentum, the month of August could see some volatility as the market braces for profit-taking activities.
Analysts at CGS-CIMB said the FBM KLCI tended to be negative in August based on historical trends and data.
“The FBM KLCI has an average month-on-month negative return of 0.8% over the past 10 years and 1.8% over the past 40 years, ” CGS-CIMB said.
It expected the market to focus on the release of the country’s second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) on Aug 14 and the outcome of the MSCI index review on Aug 12.
August is also the month of the second-quarter results season for major corporations that have their financial year ending in Dec 2020.
Other observers said the continued and sustained political stability would also be crucial for market integrity and for it to sustain gains that have been achieved.
CGS-CIMB said volatility had shrunk to its lowest levels since February as at the end of July, despite the big move at the start of the month.
“The low volatility suggests that a big move may be just around the corner. The FBM KLCI’s most recent failure last week to kick beyond the 1,617 resistance level and the triple negative divergence on its momentum indicators, coupled with the fact that the market has been held up by retailers (in 11 of the past 16 trading days, this group of market participants was the major buyers), we believe the market is due for a correction sooner rather than later, ” CGS-CIMB said.
On the currency market front, the ringgit had been strengthening of late likely due to investor expectations that Malaysia is handling the Covid-19 situation better than thought.
Analysts at Maybank Research said in a report the US dollar-to-ringgit pair looked on track to test lower.
“On July 8, we called for US dollar-ringgit to trade lower towards 4.22 objective, ” Maybank Research said.
“Further downside amid a new 4.15–4.25 range is likely but not without risks. Developments on US-China trade talks, Covid-19 second wave risks and the US fiscal stimulus outcome are some risks to keep in view, ” it added.
The ringgit was last traded at 4.1895 against the US dollar yesterday.","Aug 7, 2020 8:37 AM","Good123","strong surge, uptrend Hari ini dijangka","Aug 7, 2020 8:39 AM","Good123","Hari khas untuk aeon Hari ? :)","Aug 7, 2020 8:40 AM","Jeffreyteck","It's difficult for minority SHs to sell parkson if they bought it those days above $5, today it worth 0.08.

The Group saw another weak set of numbers reported, with the previously steady Leisure segment also slipping into a loss for the quarter. 1QFY20 net profit of only RM1.1m (-84.5% YoY, -68.7% QoQ) is below expectations at 5.3% of our and 4.5% of consensus full-year estimates. In light of current operating conditions amid the Covid-19 pandemic, we are slashing FY20/FY21/FY22 earnings estimates by 39.5%/25.1%/14.2% as we forecast larger losses in its mall operations, while also changing property launch and sales assumptions. We still like I-Berhad’s long-term value proposition underpinned by a remaining ~60% of its gross development value in Shah Alam yet to be realized. While our unchanged target price of RM0.26 (based on an already-steep 80% discount to fully-diluted RNAV) appears to provide significant price performance upside, we retain our Neutral call given the lack of near-term re-rating catalysts. Longer-term investors may find value in its attractive location which will benefit from the urbanization of the outer Klang Valley region however.
1QFY20 earnings overview. Property development pretax profit of RM3.1m (-60.3% YoY, -59.8% QoQ) remains the largest contributor despite the lower overall Group numbers. This is magnified by pretax losses of RM400,000 and RM1.1m in its property investment and leisure segments respectively due to business shutdowns following imposition of the Movement Control Order (MCO) to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. 2QFY20 contributions will be equally uninspiring as a result. Property unbilled sales declined further amid the lack of new launches, now at RM94.2m as at end-March from RM98.4m at end-December.
Business overview. Soft market conditions have seen the Group holding back on property launches, focusing instead on its property investment portfolio. The Group’s recent rights issue of preference shares puts it on strong financial footing to ride out this current soft patch, though will be unable to help stem earnings degradation from weak consumer sentiment. Owing to recent inactivity as a result of the extended MCO, its Grade-A GBI-rated office tower will now only be occupied late-3Q/early-4Q while opening of the Double Tree by Hilton Hotel and 2nd Convention Centre are now delayed to mid-2021.
Risks to earnings will come from further delays in launches. While we had previously accounted for one (valued at ~RM300m) this year, and one (also valued at ~RM300m) next year, we are now assuming delays by 6-9 months, thereby necessitating our earnings cut. Wider-than-expected losses from its mall operations may also weigh, in addition to weakness in its Leisure division. While portions of the latter have reopened, it is unlikely to operate at optimal capacity however given distancing requirements. The gradual clearing of inventories estimated at about RM300m is a plus point.

Now, when you go to its malls, the empty lots are like doubled than previously.

To lure tenants to come in, AEON has to burn more cash.

Just wonder why many keep talk bad of this counter","Aug 28, 2020 8:45 AM","Jeffreyteck","Still well supported.","Aug 28, 2020 8:55 AM","lambsauce","Quoted from HLIB:
Outlook. In the property management segment, we understand Aeon granted rental rebates to ~70% of total tenants. While July rental collection has recovered to RM50m, we understand this is still lower than pre-Covid-19 rental income of RM58m/month. Furthermore, our channel checks indicate that many retail players have either (i) closed a number of physical retail stores and/or (ii) renewed leases from shopping mall operators in recent months at significantly cheaper rates. In conclusion, we expect the PMS division (which accounted for ~75% of EBIT in FY19) to continue to suffer as Covid-19 puts pressure on physical retailers and hence, shopping mall operators. Note that even before MCO, occupancy rate slipped to 90.7% in FY19 (from 91.4% in FY18) due to the supply glut of rentable retail space.
Forecast. We lower our FY20/21/22 forecasts by to 8.5%/24.1%/14.7% to account for weaker than expected retailing sales in 1H20, lower shopping mall occupancy rates and lower rental yield from retailers renewing leases at cheaper rates.
Maintain SELL. After our earnings adjustment, our TP falls from RM0.86 to RM0.71 pegged to an unchanged 12x PE multiple of mid-FY21 earnings. While the reopening of non-essential retail with the relaxation of MCO rules bodes well from Aeon going into 2H20, we expect the MCO to exacerbate the largest issue facing shopping mall operators, which is the supply glut of available retail space in Malaysia.","Aug 28, 2020 10:21 AM","Good123","it will rebound","Aug 28, 2020 10:22 AM","Good123","rugi Sikit je for the latest quarter","Aug 28, 2020 3:03 PM","Good123","no wonder EPF bought a lot of aeon shares. next quarter results should. be","Aug 28, 2020 3:06 PM","Good123","otw RM 1 soon hopefully","Aug 28, 2020 3:06 PM","Good123","can't go holidays overseas, flood the mall for leisure :)","Aug 28, 2020 3:22 PM","Good123","should turn green soon :)","Aug 28, 2020 3:24 PM","Good123","April to June, the worst takda lagi. lockdown is over. rebound time with a marginal loss announced. otw RM 1 I think","Aug 28, 2020 3:24 PM","Good123","Target price. We are revising our target price to RM1.07 (previously RM1.08) as we roll our base year to FY21F. Our new TP is pegged to 16.0x PER FY21F EPS of 6.7sen. Our valuation is premised on -1.5SD below its three years historical average PER. We attribute the discount to the: (i) saturated retail landscape in the country; (ii) impact of Covid-19 on the economy including shifting to shopping on digital platforms; and (iii) extended cautious consumer sentiment.
Upgrade to TRADING BUY from NEUTRAL. This is due to the sharp retracement in its share price over the past few months. We believe that most of the negatives have been priced in at this point. Looking beyond the lackluster year that 2020 has been, we expect that Aeon Co is likely able to weather through the situation due to its track record. Valuation also appears much more attractive now.

Yeah, similar thoughts to my own.
Had it not been for the Covid effect it wouldn't be down at current levels, so as a mid/longer term investment it should do OK. I'm currently on the look for stocks with capital growth plus a dividend, so this fits the bill to some extent. Immediately prior to the real price effects of Covid it was in the 1.30's, so with patience I can't see any current reasons that it won't head back up towards there given time and patience. A waiting game.

There are many factors that need to be considered before the vaccine can be released to the public. Plus, the virus is developing new strains and the researchers are unclear how the vaccine will fare in different strains. Even if the vaccine is out, it may be hard for the company to gain back its profit due to the change in shopping habits. Many consumers prefer to shop online, as reflected by an increasing trend of online spending. The pandemic has also triggered the global recession, resulting in most households to spend wisely.

AEON Co. (M) (AEON MK)
Things are looking up
U/G to BUY with a higher TP of MYR1.07
AEON’s 3Q20 results met expectations. Operations at both its retail and property management services segment have turned around and we expect earnings to gradually recover in sequential quarters. No change to our earnings estimates. Rolling forward our valuation base year to FY21, our TP is raised to MYR1.07 (from MYR0.84) based on lower 14x PER (- 1.5SD to 5-year mean; previously 21.5x, -0.5SD to 10-year mean) to better reflect AEON’s current operating environment. Hence, we U/G AEON to BUY with a total shareholding return of 46%.
3Q20 core net profit of MYR21m (+146% YoY, 2Q20 core net loss: MYR3m) brought 9M20 core net profit to MYR27m (-56% YoY), reflecting 49%/44% of our/consensus full-year earnings estimates. We deem this within our expectations as we anticipate for seasonally stronger sales in 4Q. No dividend was declared during the quarter.
AEON’s 3Q20 revenue grew by 4% QoQ on the back of improved consumer spending upon easing social distancing measures during the recoveryMCO, and lesser impact from rental waivers. This was evident in both its retail (+3% QoQ) and property management services’ segmental revenue (+7% QoQ). Further, 3Q20 EBIT surged 83% QoQ while EBIT margins increased by 3.3 ppts QoQ, similarly due to margin recovery in both its core segments (retail: +3.4 ppts QoQ; property management service: +9.2 ppts QoQ).
We leave our earnings estimates unchanged. We are encouraged by AEON’s robust turnaround in earnings post-initial stages of the MCO and we anticipate for sequential earnings to continue on an uptrend given that 4Q sales are historically boosted by festive sales. Although the CMCO may soften retail sales, we expect AEON’s earnings to be supported by stable property management services segment which accounted for 95% of AEON’s 3Q20 EBIT.","Nov 26, 2020 11:06 AM","DickyMe","","Nov 26, 2020 11:16 AM","Hafid","i hope can go down to 50sen. but i doubt so.","Nov 26, 2020 11:22 AM","kereta","I will thank you if you have the volume holding onto this aeon and start selling selling selling selling to 50 cents then can reach 50 cents!

That is part of what I posted on Thursday when it was trading at 78.5. It closed at 85.5 the same afternoon and retraced slightly on Friday to close at 84.5. A very good outcome from its Thursday ""spike""
Revised targets using the current price:
TP 1: 89.5
TP 2: 94.2
TP 3: 1.03
Possible speed bumps along the way of 92 and 96.5.
I have 81.5/ 82 as a possible retracement price from the move up to Thursday's 85.5 close. Friday's price and volume indicates to me that it won't be a factor. Watch for consolidation and eventual move up to 89.5.

The prime minister said the government had signed two agreements for the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines.
Yesterday, he announced that the government had inked a preliminary purchase agreement with pharmaceutical company Pfizer to get a supply of 12.8 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to meet immunisation needs of 20% or 6.4 million of the Malaysian population.
'’Apart from the agreement with Pfizer, the government also signed an agreement with the COVAX facility to get Covid-19 vaccines to meet immunisation needs of [another] 10% of the Malaysian people.
“Insya-Allah (God willing), we will receive the vaccine supply in stages beginning from the first quarter of next year,” he said in his policy speech at Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia's (Bersatu) annual general assembly held virtually today.
Muhyiddin, who is Bersatu's president, said he is confident that with access to the vaccines and continued efforts to break the chain of Covid-19 infection, the country could bring the disease under complete control, and help revive its economy and improve the people’s well-being.

The research house said it is feeling upbeat over the group’s longer-term prospects despite the near-term challenges caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, after having a virtual meeting with Aeon Co’s management team.
“Based on some of the pointers the management shared, we deduce that performance in FY21 is likely to be better than in FY20 although it may not be recovering to the pre-pandemic level yet.
“From there onwards, we expect a firmer recovery from FY22 onwards in view of some of the new growth plans the management is putting in place,” said MIDF Research analyst Ng Bei Shan in a note today.
Ng also noted that the impact of the coronavirus on the group’s business in different regions varied. For instance, its Johor business was adversely impacted by the closure of the Johor-Singapore border and the company is looking into cross-border delivery.
The analyst said the management shared that it has identified a new flat-price model to be rolled out next year as the company plans to open up 10 stores of such format.
On top of that, Ng said it is reviewing the positioning of Aeon Wellness to avoid direct competition with other mass market pharmacies or wellness stores, besides looking to further refine its offering by bringing in new imported products from Japan.
“This will be with the help of data analytics to provide relevant offerings to customers. The company has also embarked on a membership consolidation exercise across its different businesses, which will see its member base increase to two million by end of the year,” said Ng.
Furthermore, the management team also shared that it will continue to be agile in its marketing plans in order to make the online and offline shopping experience more seamless for customers, said Ng.
“On the flipside, it will continue to consolidate its procurement and purchases at the group level to garner better scale and bargaining power when liaising with its suppliers,” she added.
Following the group’s upbeat prospects, Ng has upgraded Aeon Co to ""buy"" from ""trading buy"", but he made no changes to the group’s earnings forecasts.
“We think Aeon Co will be able to benefit from the recovery of the economy and consumer spending. On top of that, valuation appears much more attractive now. Although consumers increasingly shop online especially since the pandemic, we think that offline shopping will continue to have its place with an experiential offering that online shopping cannot displace.
“As such, we think that retailers such as Aeon Co that adapt to the changes in consumer behaviours will stand out in the long term,” said the analyst.
At the time of writing, shares in Aeon Co had risen one sen or 1.06% to 95 sen, bringing its market capitalisation to RM1.33 billion. It saw some 1.94 million shares traded.","Dec 8, 2020 3:24 PM","core9design","Goreng started in afternoon, can breach RM1 anytime","Dec 8, 2020 3:55 PM","awieze","goreng just a few minutes.like yesterday","Dec 8, 2020 4:13 PM","awieze","not today, tomorrow, tomorrow never die","Dec 8, 2020 4:19 PM","yingzhe17","Epf sell you buy","Dec 8, 2020 10:54 PM","JayC88","starting round two? lol","Dec 9, 2020 8:43 AM","t_nike2002","MIDF Research raises Aeon target price to RM1.18, expects firmer recovery from FY22 onwards https://www.klsescreener.com/v2/news/view/763635","Dec 9, 2020 8:44 AM","t_nike2002","MIDF Research has raised its target price for Aeon Co (M) Bhd to RM1.18, from RM1.01 previously, based on 18.7 times the earnings per share of 6.3 sen for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2021 (FY21).

Aeon ups digital ambition with Boxed Wholesale tie-up
KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 28): Aeon Co (M) Bhd has announced a partnership with US-based Boxed Wholesale that will see the retailer utilising the e-commerce company’s state-of-the-art technology to accelerate Aeon’s expansion into new retail offerings.
Boxed will be supporting Aeon in its efforts to expand into business-to-business ventures and new retail solutions via Aeon’s virtual mall. The platform is expected to support Aeon’s 4,000 tenants in its malls throughout the country.
In a joint press statement released by the two companies, they announced that Aeon will be utilising Boxed Wholesale’s proprietary storefront platform and inventory-picking software, including click-and-collect services from selected Aeon stores.
Aeon Malaysia’s chief executive officer Shafie Shamsuddin in the statement today said that the tie-up will bring about a wholesome customer experience by bridging its more than 1.3 million customers from offline to the online space.
“We are confident that we can bring in quality tenants and merchants, as proven in our brick and mortar business, into our virtual mall,” said Shafie.
He added that Boxed Wholesale is one of the few e-commerce companies in the world that built entrepreneurial value in the company by running its own consumer business using its own technology.
The virtual mall is expected to be rolled out in 2Q2021.
“The ability for an enterprise customer to make just one call to modernize their digital and physical e-commerce capabilities is truly rare. To do it with low capital expenditure is even rarer.
We are beyond excited to bring our technology to retailers around the world and help them succeed in today’s competitive market,” said Boxed Wholesale chief executive officer Chieh Huang.
Boxed Wholesale is an e-commerce platform that was established in 2013, and has an annual turnover of more than US$500 million. It is an online bulk-product retailer that brings the wholesale shopping experience to customers through direct-to-their-door access to warehouse club products.","Jan 29, 2021 9:57 AM","traintobullland","good news! this is the sustainability that investors like to see :D","Jan 30, 2021 12:40 AM","sunnyleong","70 sen","Jan 30, 2021 8:23 AM","William Ng","Nah,80 sen.","Jan 30, 2021 8:24 AM","William Ng","After mco still have cmco","Jan 30, 2021 10:34 AM","traintobullland","above RM1 by end of Feb","Jan 30, 2021 11:47 AM","traintobullland","You know you are investing in the right company when the company makes effort to adapt to changes and to improve its operation","Jan 30, 2021 11:47 AM","traintobullland","HLG: Buy call TP 1.17","Feb 1, 2021 7:43 AM","warchest","Partnership with Boxed is good news.

In essence, this partnership is a game changer to AEON into their virtual mall and B2B market. Boxed is very credible, with proven business model in this area.
Covid creates a lot of headwinds to AEON, especially on the reduced rents collected from all its assets and reduction in footfall especially during CNY festive season.

Aeon Co (M) Bhd is aiming for its new digital shopping platforms to contribute 15% to 20% of its retail revenue over the next five years, according to chief executive officer Shafie Shamsuddin.
The group that runs Aeon Retail Malaysia has tied up with American grocery e-commerce retailer Boxed to build what Shafie calls a new online retail ecosystem, which is targetted to roll out by the end of the second quarter in 2021.
“We have 16 physical locations in Malaysia, where we can build fulfillment centres, together with Boxed technology. Nobody else has this capability currently in Malaysia, ” said Shafie in an online interview.
Shafie said the new online retail ecosystem will deliver options and personalised solutions to Aeon customers who can choose to visit the malls and get their groceries and goods delivered to them while dining in restaurants, or delivered to their homes or offices.
“Aeon customers will be able to enjoy unique user experiences. Aeon Malaysia is one of the largest mall operators in the country. We have a 10% share of the net leasable area, and as such have a lot of brands and choices offered by over 4,000 tenants. Our tenants will also be offering their products and services via our online platform, using Boxed solutions, ” said Shafie.
He said this year, the group will be working on integrating the Boxed technology with Aeon operations in the Klang Valley, before moving on to other Aeon operations across the country in early 2022.
Shafie said for 2021, the group has a capital expenditure (capex) of RM200mil where the bulk will be for renovations and maintenance for Aeon malls, and 30% will be focused on digital platform and transformation.
Aeon Malaysia is the pilot for Boxed technology outside the United States.
“The Boxed platform can be applicable to Aeon companies globally. Malaysia is one of the countries that has the biggest Aeon presence in Asia, but it is not as big or complex as Japan. After implementing Boxed technology in Malaysia, we plan to roll it out to other Asean countries, ” said Shafie.
Boxed has signed an eight-figure US dollar deal with Aeon Malaysia to utilise its technology to accelerate Aeon’s digital transformation.
The two companies did not disclose the value of the deal, other than to say it would be a multi-year collaboration.
Also present at the online interview was Boxed chief executive officer Chieh Huang who said the partnership with Japan’s Aeon Group was a “good marriage” where the integrated Japanese retailer had the resources and scale, while Boxed provided new technology.
“It has been seven and a half years. We built the business with millions of customers and hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue.
“We built the technology – from the front-end software, inventory management system to the warehouse management system, and even the robotics,"" said Huang.
Our newest fulfillment centres are 100% automated by our own homegrown robotics, ” said Chieh, adding that there are very few companies in the world that has this kind of vertically integrated technology stack.
In August 2018, Boxed had closed a US$110mil funding round led by Aeon Group. It was reported that the two companies would collaborate on fulfillment logistics, robotics and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven data usage.
“When we first started the partnership, it was really for us to advise Aeon Group on our technology and their digital transformation. So, what we are doing here now has been an evolution of that conversation over the last two years, ” said Chieh.
Chieh explained that Boxed technology provide cost savings to its customers.
“With Boxed technology, the benefits are time saving, cost efficiencies, as well as convenience, and addressing safety concerns in this Covid-19 era. We will also provide business-to-business services to our tenants and SMEs (small and medium enterprises). In the future, we will also provide financing to SMEs through this ecosystem, via the end-to-end solutions provided by Boxed, ” said Shafie.","Feb 7, 2021 5:10 PM","traintobullland","However it goes, once news hit that vaccine arrived in Malaysia 2 weeks from now, retail sector is one of the recovery sectors investors will be aiming.

TP1: 1.08

As for your comment about people flocking back and packing out places, well I'm a bit less convinced about that, in the short term anyway. The vaccine is definitely a plus but I'm still not convinced it is the silver bullet to get things promptly back to normal .
The economy will still struggle this year as it will take quite a bit of time to repair the damage we have already suffered before we can be positive and go into spending mode. IMO.

April to June Revenue: Rm 954 Mill.
July to August Revenue: Rm 989 Mill.
Clearly the effect of the country's first MCO effected revenue for the April to June quarter.
There was a Rm 35 Mill. increase in revenue in the following quarter.
It requires a Rm 11 Mill. increase in revenue in the upcoming quarterly to go back over the Rm 1B level.
If that can be achieves with a net profit equal of greater than the last quarter, then it could provide support and further gains.

Just a personal observation regarding Aeon and the Covid dilemma, it seems to me that Aeon has finally put a strong focus on its business and staff structure.

What does seem clear to me is that finally Aeon realise that their business model needed a swift kick up the backside and a modified structure to their business.
It took a pandemic for them to realise that it needed a major change and now the turnaround is beginning. This new approach should have started long before the covid pandemic but at least it has actually started.
As the country and businesses slowly come out of this current situation I think you will see a better and more efficient Aeon model than they had prior to the pandemic.

Bollinger Bands are tightening and will eventually be tighter than a duck's backside, so something has to eventually break to the up or downside.

It will probably bore the backside off most in here but I think there are some other technical readers that might be interested.
This current rising pattern started at the beginning of February when the price was 0.915 cents. That was just over 2 months ago, however the rise was mainly all done in the fist month, Feb2 @0.915 to March 4, 1.34, around a 46% rise. For the second month it has mainly been going through consolidation/distribution around the 1.30 +/- area and not giving back much of that 40%+ rise, that's quite impressive considering overall market sentiment during that month. The first retrace point of that rise was 1.24 (second retrace point was 1.17) and with only a couple of very brief intraday drops to the 1.24 level during the month, the 1.24 price point was always respected and not broken.
Throughout the past month the Bursa has been volatile (understatement), however this has had very little effect on the Aeon price, which has been a surprise for me. Due to the tight price range that it has been trading in for just over a month, the Bollinger Bands have gradually tightened. The last 3 weeks end of week BB gaps have dropped from 14.21 to 9.32, then to 6.50 last Friday(9th). If it remains at the same rate it is possible by next Friday it could be at 4 or less...very tight. Eventually something has to give. I'll be watching that indicator closely during this current week.
Other indicators I use are showing neutral to positive.
MACD is gradually tightening and showing possible signs of a crossover either later this week or the following week.
Volume has been relatively soft over the past month, so I suggest monitoring that to see any signs of increased interest/volume.
A final thought......the start of the last rise commenced about 4 weeks prior to the release of the Quarterly, so could we see a similar pattern here, or perhaps even a few weeks earlier? The next Quarterly is due around May 24.
My Fib points if it was to break 1.33/1.34 with volume are:
TP 1: 1.44
TP 2: 1.50
TP 3: 1.55
ps. For Wen Jun. A couple of weeks ago you mentioned a possible bull flag pointing to the 1.70-1.75 area. The Fib TP5 is actually at 1.76 but I think think it would take some very extraordinary news or a bumper Quarterly to get anywhere near there. I guess stranger things have happened, though...lol :)
Let's not get ahead of ourselves though, it has to break 1.34 before it's going anywhere. Will it, won't it? We'll eventually find out.","Apr 13, 2021 10:40 AM","Jack888","Ok... its good...buy more..","Apr 13, 2021 10:43 AM","TreeTopView","Needs to close above 1.34, IMO.

For the short term at least, there was at least a couple of positives, although there is no guarantee they will remain. The KLCI support of 1,555 remained in place as we saw an upward bounce from 1,556. As for Aeon, it was able to hold the 1.17 support level so now needs to break the former 1.24 support level to have any chance of moving upwards.
If only I had a crystal ball to know if that will happen. Overall market sentiment is weak and non committal, so I'm not holding my breath for a strong rebound for now.

I think you are being a bit too over optimistic :)
Earnings right now are mainly from the supermarket sector and have been robust, considering the Covid effect, and we can thank their business restructuring for those recent results (last 3 quarters). Eventually their other two sectors, department stores and rental, will add to their earnings but that will take time.
I'm fairly positive about their long tern progress but it will take time for the department stores and rentals to really kick in.

Almost Rm11 million profit. Considering the Covid restrictions during the period it is a good result. I have to be honest and say I was hoping for a bit more than Rm11 million (EPS 0.78 cents) and had targetted an EPS of around 1.33 cents to bring their rolling 4 quarters EPS to 6 cents. That should have supported the recent price moves.
With the current results the rolling 4 quarters EPS is now 5.45 cents, compared to 3.99 cents prior to yesterday's results.
Too difficult to say what the Funds will do to the price with these results, however I think my Fib targets of 1.60 and 1.685 will not be achieved on these results.

I see they have opened up the games room at Tg. Rambutan Hospital.
They really need to remove that PC from the room.
Stick to basket weaving, buddy.","Sep 24, 2021 4:13 PM","coolkwc","damn boring. Rally at 1.49 for almost 2 weeks.","Sep 25, 2021 11:48 AM","TreeTopView","coolkwc, it might be ""boring"" but it is stable. That is far more important when you consider the KLCI has dropped from 1,600 to 1,520 during September.
Another plus is the fact that the shorted shares continue to slowly get covered. We have had 147,000 covered this week, up to Thursday's closing figures.
All things considered, I believe the price is holding up well.
My thoughts only, but if the KLCI can gradually move back up to 1,600+ before the end of the calendar year, then we might see Aeon attempt to take on the next Fibonacci targets of 1.60, 1.68, and 1.76.","Oct 1, 2021 11:24 AM","hahasong","","Oct 2, 2021 1:50 AM","dragonfruit123","kena sell down suddenly","Oct 21, 2021 4:18 PM","firehawk","opportunity :-)","Nov 1, 2021 7:55 AM","VennesA","Aeon just celebrate it anniversary.

Yes must wait as long as the neck of giraffe
AEON supermarkets only draw in customers
Most of the Shops AEON tenanted to others are doing badly as Covid 19 prevent crowds from visiting Malls
Plus high food prices with lesser income where got extra spending power
So AEON will see tough times
Better sell AEON and buy Palm oil shares
