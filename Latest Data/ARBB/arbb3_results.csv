最近除了Serba Dynamics与审计师的风波之外， ARBB也受到了投资者的关注。 这家科技公司令投资者们又爱又恨。
因此， 我决定以中立的角度来讨论投资者们对该公司提出的几个关键问题，以确认ARBB是否是一家值得投资或应该避免的公司。
重点#1 - 不可赎回的可转换优先股 (ICPS)
对于不熟悉ICPS的投资者来说，该公司已于2018年12月以15个ICPS对1股母股的基础上执行了ICPS的配股。
例子：
小明在2018年12月17日（除息日）持有每股30仙，总计为10,000股的ARBB股票，他有权获得150,000股ICPS。
总金额： 1仙 * 150,000单位的ICPS= RM1,500.00
然而，随着配股的完成，该公司的股价有所调整。 小明是否因为认购ICPS而亏本了呢？ 实际上， 这与大多数配股案件不同， 小明并没有任何的损失。
截至今日，ICPS的定价为10.5仙，相当于小明获得了10.5倍的回报。 最初的RM1,500.00 至今已涨至RM15,750.00， 这在股市中是难得一见的！
那么现在的情况又如何呢？
发行ICPS为ARBB筹集了1008万令吉，并继续以零利率为公司筹集了更多资金。 ARBB-PA的转换价或行权价为20仙，迄今为止，已有541,009,231个ARBB-PA已转换为母股。 数额来源于：
配股前的发行股数： 67,210,000 股
现有的发行股数： 608,219,231 股
由ICPS转换的发行股： 541,009,231 股
未被转换的ICPS： 467,140,​​769 股
从第一次转换发生之日起，以每次转换价为 20仙，该公司已筹集了总计1.082亿令吉的现金。 然而，这也对股东的股权造成了稀释影响。 例如，投资者的每股收益，每股股息，和 每股净资产受到了ICPS转换为母股的影响。 每股收益与每股股息将会减少， 但由于资金流入了公司， 每股净资产将会增加。
因此，ICPS确实对公司造成了稀释影响，但同时为未来的扩张计划筹集了大量现金。 总体而言，这对现有股东来说是公平的，因为公司获得了股东们筹集的现金而增长。
但ARBB的非凡增长也引起了一些投资者的质疑。 我接下来将分享有关该公司的基本面。"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=402","Jul 6, 2021 4:22 PM","mananghunter","重点#2 - ARBB会计报告的合法性
大家都知道， 若审计师拒绝签署文件，上市公司的审计报告将永远无法提交到投资者手中。 尽管市场对ARBB提出了疑点， 但该公司仍然能够提交年度报告。 ARBB在这方面给了我一个好印象。
除了2021年第一季度， 该公司的表现都令人眼前一亮。 此外，该公司的应收账款也令部分投资者感到担忧。 如图所见，随着公司的发展，应收账款也显着增加，这导致商业活动所产生的净现金减少了。 对于科技公司来说，这是相当不寻常的。
但是，审计师已经指出了这个问题， 并对应收账款进行了合理的取证研究，这已经证实了ARBB的应收账款本质上不具有欺诈性。
可以说的是， 该公司在收取现金方面可能被比较弱！"

ARBB的市盈率仅仅为3.64倍的个位数。 这个数字甚至低于一些周期性行业，如建筑、石油和天然气、种植园等。 这个估值到底是怎么回事？
在我们得出结论之前，让我们不要忘记将 ICPS作为公司估值主要的稀释原因。
当最大的稀释效应发生时， 所有的ICPS将转换为母股时， ARBB 的总发行股数将是1,075,360,000。 若要计算该公司的最大稀释效应后的市盈率， 我们必须得到过去4个季度的税后利润， 总值为5620万令吉。
下一步， 我们将税后利润的总值除以稀释效应最大的总发行股数（1,075,360,000）， 每股收益是5.23仙。 ARBB 目前的交易价格为26仙，以5.23仙的每股收益，最大稀释后的市盈率将会是是4.97倍。
那么为何市场对ARBB的稀释后的市盈率估值低于5倍呢？
我认为这是ARBB的核心业务缺乏了解所造成的，最近该公司的业绩下滑也动摇了投资者们的信心。 尽管如此，现在我不打算讨论该公司的股价走势， 而是关注一些该公司需要澄清的问题。
结论
根据以上的研究， ARBB比市场上的反对声浪所说的表现更好。 虽然ARBB在应收账款上的风险很高，但绝对是合法的的。 我认为最近的股价低迷已经证明了风险是合理的，而且ARBB肯定应该获得更好的估值。 对于一家科技公司来说，最少是稀释后的 10倍？"

Newark, an Avnet Company and global distributor of electronic components, products and solutions, has published new research on the Internet of Things (IoT) which reveals the growing role of IoT for industrial automation and control applications essential to the delivery of Industry 4.0. The IoT Survey, which is run annually by Newark, generates new insights on this key market, including opportunities and challenges for engineers working in IoT.
The top three industry segments leading the way in IoT applications are industrial automation and control (25%), home automation (18%) and artificial intelligence (12%). Despite industrial automation and control being deemed a key market for IoT, there is recognition that Industry 4.0 adoption remains slow, primarily due to concerns over security (32%) and lack of business strategy (30%) hindering the adoption and integration of smart manufacturing solutions. Security continues to be the most important aspect for developers to consider (29%) when developing their design, and it is also their primary concern (36%), followed by connectivity and interoperability.
The perceived value of data collected by IoT connected devices is a considerable factor in the adoption of IoT. The increasingly connected world of smart cities, factories, homes and vehicles now has devices and systems autonomously exchanging and storing data. This data offers organisations the ability to make improvements, increase profits or reduce costs across many business functions while delivering improved quality, increased efficiency, compliance and predictive maintenance benefits. In the survey, 48% of respondents cited productivity and manufacturing enhancements as their main reasons for designing-in IoT connectivity.
Not unexpectedly, respondents continue to adopt AI as part of their solutions. 39% said they are using AI in their designs already and a further 47% say they would be willing to implement AI within future projects. Environmental sensors are reported as the most common sensors used within IoT devices, used to measure temperature, humidity, pressure, gas and more. This has been a consistent trend in each of the three years that Newark has run the survey. The survey also found that a large number of respondents are using SBCs as the core of IoT designs (48%).
Innovative solutions for smart home, industry, marketplace and government are paving the way to build the future of IoT. Research showed that the IoT continues to be important for future designs. Nevertheless, when asked whether their company is taking a leadership position in the future of IoT, half of respondents (49%) stated they have 0-25% confidence that their company will take a lead role in shaping IoT. Only 11% of respondents expected to be ahead of the IoT curve and have a clear vision about its future.
During 2020, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the IoT industry led to rapid growth in the development of new medical devices and systems, with the potential to fuel demand for improved connected medical equipment in the future. IoT is changing the way patients are diagnosed, treated and monitored and supporting vaccine tracking, inventory managements and more. A quarter of survey participants expect healthcare to be the next big industry likely to take advantage of innovation in IoT connectivity. The use of SBCs as the core of IoT design is also in line with anecdotal feedback that Newark has received from customers that during the COVID-19 pandemic, design engineers have embraced development kits and single board computers as they design at home.
Cliff Ortmeyer, Global Head of Technical Marketing for Newark says: “Industrial automation and the continued implementation of Industry 4.0 will provide the largest and fastest growing IoT market for at least the medium term. This is a key focus of the Newark business and an area we are investing in significantly. Newark is committed to supporting customers in their IoT journey and can offer a growing portfolio of IoT products and solutions, as well as access to market insights that better enable innovation and improve customer know-how. The IoT Survey, now in its third year, is becoming a yardstick for the IoT industry; what engineers value in IoT solutions, how they build their IoT design, and what challenges they face day-to-day. It enables us to improve our offering to customers based directly on their wants and needs and hopefully provides informative and educational insights into the IoT market as a whole.”
Newark’s 2020 IoT survey also provides insights on decisions regarding ‘wireless vs. wired’ connectivity in IoT design, preferred vendors, the most popular SBCs for new IoT designs, most commonly used programming languages and communications preferences."

The introduction of these services has led to process transformation for several organizations and companies. Known as one of the leading technologies of the modern world, cloud computing entails usage of internet for storing records, documents, tools, and shared computing records. Adoption of this technology has allowed companies to host their complete computing infrastructure on virtual platforms through remote data centers. Today, cloud ERP is used for managing human capital, finance, and several other important aspects of a business.
In the coming years, analysts visualize that intelligent usage of cloud ERP application will reduce operational expenses. A key advantage of using these solutions will be the ability for organizations, businesses, and institutes to avoid the need to purchase servers, storage hardware, and thereby reduce the expenditure required for maintaining them. Despite the several benefits of using cloud ERP solutions, the technology comes with its set of disadvantages.
The downside of deploying ERP software is the issue of integration of company’s legacy systems and ERP modules. Solutions that are designed to ensure this smooth transfer are expected to open up several new markets for the global cloud ERP market in the near future. Yet another key factor likely to support the growth of the global market is the confidence enjoyed by companies that their data is backed up at all times and that the solution comes with a disaster recovery plan.
Global Cloud ERP Market: Overview
The global cloud enterprise resource planning (ERP) market is expected to display double-digit growth rate in the coming years. Businesses are increasingly integrating cloud-based ERP applications with conventional ones, thereby creating hybrid ERP systems that can support new business models and can be scaled to serve new customer demands."

Remember that Serba Dinamik, thusfar, has no convictions in court meaning you are innocent until proven guilty. There are over 1400 Public listed companies in Bursa Malaysia. With 1 black (unpopular) sheep, does it mean that all 99.98% Public listed companies like Carlsberg, Maybank, YTL, Nestle are distrusted? Certainly not."

WHY HAVE REASONABLE TRUST IN ARBB’S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE?
As a public listed company, ARBB is no different and scrutinised or watched by authorities such as
= Independent Non Executive Directors
= Bursa Malaysia
= Licensing authorities
= External Auditors
= Institutional shareholders
= retail shareholders
= Anti- Corruption Agency
= Transparency on need to disclose its reports to public
= 3rd party & Independent Awards to CEO Larry and ARBB by Prestigious APEC (Asia Pacific Enterprise Award) in 2020. (Source: https://apea.asia/regional/hall-of-fame-2020/corporate-excellence-cate... )"

WHY RSM’S AUDIT REPORT WILL IMPROVE YOUR CONFIDENCE?
RSM is major mid size International Audit firm who reviewed ARBB Financial statements for year end Dec 2020. There is a new audit report format that requires Auditors to focus on Material Risky Items and you guessed it right - the Receivables of >1 year carrying value at RM102m as at Mac 2021 certainly arise.
RSM is required by ISA (International Standards of Auditing) to perform additional audit investigation that the material risky item is fairly stated ie it is not fictitious or that is should it be classified as bad debts in view that customers have not paid for over 1 year."

WHAT ADDITIONAL AUDIT PROCEDURES OR EVIDENCES THAT RSM UNCOVER AND TRANSPARENTLY REPORTED ON?
RSM provided 5 disclosures on why they opined that the receivables are reliable valuation:
1. Developed understanding of the design and implementation of controls associated with the monitoring of outstanding receivables and deposits impairment calculation.
2. Developed understanding of significant credit exposures which were significantly overdue or deemed to be in default through analysis of ageing reports.
3. Obtained confirmation of balances from selected debtors and suppliers.
4. Checked subsequent receipts, customers/suppliers correspondence, and consider level of activity with customers/suppliers and management’s explanation on recoverability with significantly past due balances.
5. Assessed the reasonableness and calculation of expected credit losses as at end of the reporting period.
(Source: ARBB Annual Report 2020)
No External auditors can give absolute or 100% confirmation but gives reasonable relative assurance that the balance are valid but it increases our investors’ confidence because they perform the audit procedures independently or without interference from Executive Directors and manages."

STRANGELY, WHY DID RSM DECIDE TO RETIRE AS ARBB’S AUDITORS FOR COMING 2021?
Most likely reason is RSM is a profit seeking firm. Look at the amount of audit procedures performed above meaning the resources on time and labour incurred. RSM partners possibly perceive the job is profitable enough. Bear in mind, External Auditors CANNOT cut corners to reduce costs and protect profit margins. They are liable to lawsuits and major accounting firms went bankrupt such as Arthur Andersen."

KEY TAKEAWAYS
To be concerned about the Receivables is certainly justified. After you review audit disclosures, this should reduce our fears, relatively speaking.
As investors, you look at the business model with wide moats and review the Corporate Governance before you invest."

Few questions before investing:
1. Is Info Tech the way forward in this ecnomic times in next 10 years?
2. Does ARBB offer unique services that rivals are unable to copy?
3. Will you expect Work at Home, Internet of things using Handphones, Auto gates, Auto Airconds, Automobiles, Auto Microwaves as the growing trend in next 10 - 15 years.
My humble opinion, ARBB Financial statements in 2020 are legit based on above findings.
I quote our generation’s most famous greatest investors:
You want to buy a wonderful business at reasonable price and not buy reasonable business at wonderful price. (Warren Buffett, 1997)

PETALING JAYA (July 16): The local construction industry is embracing technology and digitalisation at an accelerated pace amid the pandemic, a key takeaway during the ConTECH Talk 2021 held today.
Retired chief judge of Sabah and Sarawak Tan Sri David Wong Dak Wah said in his keynote speech: “We see the pandemic has pushed all types of sectors to find ways to effectively operate online, with equal doses of opportunity and setback – and construction is no exception. Being regarded as relatively conservative, making change happen effectively in the construction industry is definitely one of the toughest challenges.”
During the online session, he added: “In Malaysia, the level of building information modelling (BIM) adoption stands at 17%, as compared with the US (71%), UK (38%) and Singapore (65%). Apart from cost and a lack of existing-use cases, a mindset shift among construction practitioners remains the biggest challenge. This human factor in terms of acceptance of technology, lack of knowledge and individual hesitance are among identified barriers in the implementation of technologies behind Industry 4.0 in the local construction industry.”"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=405","Jul 16, 2021 8:37 PM","soonning65","The value of construction work done in 2020 contracted by 19.4% to RM117.9 billion, as compared to RM146.4 billion in 2019. During the review period of 1Q2021, the value dipped by 10.5%, which amounts to RM31.4 billion, according to Wong. He opined: “Due to the pandemic, we hope that the current situation opens the possibility to transform the construction’s technology and digitisation [and shy stakeholders] into the kind of technological and digital advocates that could facilitate an industry revolution in years to come. Construction technology is indeed an investment, and the pandemic has taught us precious lessons that we need investments in new ways of doing things.”
Wong highlighted that the National Construction 4.0 Strategic Plan (2021-2025) emphasises on integrated technologies as one of the four enablers that will drive its implementation towards achieving digital revolution in the Malaysian construction landscape, of which 12 disruptive technologies are targeted to be adopted in the five years term.
Some of the technologies discussed during the talk include BIM, prefabrication and modular construction, autonomous construction, augmented reality and virtualisation, cloud and real time collaboration, 3D scanning and photogrammetry, big data and predictive analysis, internet of things (IoT), 3D printing and additive manufacturing, advanced building materials, blockchain and artificial intelligence.
The technologies present plenty of benefits, according to Wong. “If you look at the statistics issued by the Malaysian Judiciary, there was an increase in the registration of construction cases from 1,217 in 2017 to 1,324 in 2018, and 1,510 in 2019. The causes for the claims are multi fold – delays in work, variations in quantities, errors in design drawings and plans, different site conditions, unexpected increase in material prices, payments delay and force majeure, to name a few. But the employment of technologies on project sites is reported to likely result in, among others, the reduction of project delays and related claims.”"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=405","Jul 16, 2021 8:37 PM","soonning65","He said: “From the business perspective, measuring the return on investment (ROI) is critical. In a study analysing the BIM ROI for 10 projects, a variation was found – that it is inaccurate to define a specific range for BIM ROI. However, the average BIM ROI for projects under study was 634%, which clearly depicts its potential economic benefits.
""The benefits associated with the adoption and implementation of the technologies are manifold – saving cost and time, improving quality and safety and improving the image of the industry.
A proper use of technology and digitisation could present an opportunity to reduce the embedded carbon footprint in construction activities, which accounts for almost one-third of global energy consumption, making it responsible for 38% of the world’s global CO2 emissions,” Wong said.

Companies already have tactics for moving their businesses forward, so they are often very hesitant to understand the specifics of modern solutions, especially if the benefits of a technology are not obvious. Though difficult to understand, investing in Internet of Things (IoT) systems could level up your revenue stream while offering other engaging prospects.
Because the benefits of investing in IoT technology require clarification, let’s discuss those benefits before highlighting the primary steps to invest in IoT and covering the potential challenges.
Companies already have tactics for moving their businesses forward, so they are often very hesitant to understand the specifics of modern solutions, especially if the benefits of a technology are not obvious. Though difficult to understand, investing in Internet of Things (IoT) systems could level up your revenue stream while offering other engaging prospects.
Because the benefits of investing in IoT technology require clarification, let’s discuss those benefits before highlighting the primary steps to invest in IoT and covering the potential challenges.
Benefits Of Investing In IoT
In my extensive experience, there are four main reasons why organizations invest in the IoT ecosystem:
1. Business Opportunities
The latest report estimates that 31 billion new IoT devices were installed in 2020. These technologies include remote monitoring, asset tracking in supply chain management sector and smart city projects, all of which have already shown successful business outcomes.

These kinds of IoT solutions increase an organizations’ ability for an overall market repositioning and can help launch new products. This, in turn, makes a difference in market feedback and customer reviews.
2. Cost Reduction And Efficiency
The capability to get real-time data from devices in an intelligent environment can help organizations rebalance overhead by cutting operating and service costs. In the manufacturing industry, for example, improved production and service efficiency can drive more activity and cause less downtime. As the turnover of the business increases, you can use these technologies to monitor production less often and prevent production losses.
3. Safety
Real-time monitoring of poorly serviced industrial equipment or tangible assets allows for accelerated emergency response. For instance, intelligent office buildings are frequently equipped with sensors for secure access. Fingerprint scanning for authorized entry can reduce the risk of intrusion. Living, as we do, in a contentious age of regulation and litigation can sometimes lead to massive financial consequences that can make it difficult for businesses to recover.
4. Personalization
On the sales end of the spectum, gathering data from IoT-enabled devices can generate personalized advertisements to improve customer awareness by offering a list of products focused on their needs or personal healthcare treatment. The merger of personalization and IoT allows businesses to broaden consumer-based marketing by, for example, suggesting related products when a client buys one product.
How To Get Started With An IoT Investment
The first step to a successful IoT investment is to ensure it is aligned with financial rates of return. From a financial perspective, initial investment costs often do not fully cover the range of ongoing processes throughout the entire IoT-enabled organization. So, keep in mind your business model and factor in additional operating costs for each product or device that may be required.
Some internal processes within the organization should also be transformed because new digital services affect current activities in the operational, organizational and financial structure. In other words, a brand new culture requires hard skills and, sometimes, additional manpower to allow the company to be ready to face cutting-edge transformations.
Beyond transforming your internal structure, a well-structured project management plan ensures the company’s entire ecosystem operates smoothly. While adopting new digital approaches, choose the best tools to maintain transparency in processes and ones that offer high efficiency."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=405","Jul 19, 2021 11:58 AM","mananghunter","IoT Investment Challenges
The crucial moment of any business in the decision-making process comes while estimating potential challenges. The primary point to consider is the high investment costs of IoT adoption. Even if the company isn’t aware of what kind of ROI to expect, a lack of resources will make your financial capabilities more sensitive.
Also, the substantial amount of data generated on IoT devices raises security concerns. Regular IoT security assessments are necessary to equip an IoT platform with the most robust security protocols.
Finally, business leaders should ask potential vendors how they will mitigate connectivity downtime. IoT technologies require maintenance, and the right vendor can help ensure uninterrupted platform connectivity.
Conclusion
In my experience, the fields of healthcare, agriculture, utilities, manufacturing and transportation are experiencing new heights thanks to IoT investments. IoT-generated data has helped to improve customer experience, product quality, operating efficiency and overall revenue streams.
Companies always need to consider the risk of failing to compete technologically in their sector. Inaction in considering IoT is no longer an option due to its rapid growth. Before an IoT investment, businesses need to create a strong plan and evaluate the challenges. However, by leveraging leading technologies, you may be able to scale your business fast."

Hahha. Very good question.
I hold lots of share in arbb as I treat them as long term. If you ask me current price good to enter, I will say yes, the share price drop to supporting level and definitely the share price is undervalued.
Here you go when you come to invest in this stock. Able to hold for long term ? This counter lots of hater. Are you confident in arbb and patient enough to bear with their non sense comments ? Jkjk... hahaaha. Let's start.
The whole company structure is good , just there are some minor issues when go to collecting money. Guess there are many company actually having this problem too but this is business. Never have a Business go perfect all time . Even amazon & apple having the same issues at the past too but where are they now. They are booming stock.
You need to filter the pro and cons by yourself, I not even know what is going to happening next.
Anyhow I'm still looking good in arbb on different perspectives. Iot and erp the next big thing in future. If you were still new to arb , try study back the report in this 2 year, you will see it , arbb is slowly improving from quarter to quarter, don't you think is a good sign for arbb? Well, No matter how good I said, some people just won't buy it. There are too many haters here. Hahaha
Ps :investing come with risk, make your own study before buying any stock."

Investors should notice by now, that the only performing sector in bursa is the technology sector. And recently, a few stocks – just with the tag or name with “TEC” had seen a crazy return on share price – for completely no logical reason.
But nevertheless, hot monies are flowing into the technology sector. So as investor, what should we do?
We can either:
Sit and complain.
Join the “TEC” bandwagon.
Look for an under looked technology counter.
Today, I would like to introduce you to ARB Berhad (KLSE:7181). ARBB had been an “underdog” in the technology with their impressive earnings and growth prospect in the ERP software industry, and IoT in the hardware & software industry.
By using YTD data as a gauge, we can see that not only ARBB had gone down by 7.5% in share price – but also underperform against the comparable technology index, which has gone up by 30.0% as a whole.
Why has ARBB been under looked?
The missing ingredient in ARBB has been the lack out of “precision engineering”, “E&E”, “EMS”, “Automated Test Equipment” and on and on. You can make a very long list out of these companies.
Currently, ARBB is trading at 3.43 times in PER, and this is truly sad for a company with a technology background. I find this article in mandarin explained ARBB quite well and investors should refer to the said article.
https://www.facebook.com/chuxininvestment/posts/274369521043764
To me, ARBB looks just like CENSOF, or DNEX before the market realize their true potential. Take a look at both DNEX and CENSOF share price trend movement.
Why do I use CENSOF, or DNEX as a benchmark? This is because both of these companies are involved in the software end of the technology sector, and had been neglected by investors for a very, very long time.
I think ARBB is just lacking the theme to fly, with a low PER of 3.43 times.
By all means, this is not an article to call buy or sell, but just a sharing of my opinion in the technology sector. Hope this helps!"

Please don't mislead.
ARB Bhd earned the spot of 2020 Asia Pacific Technology Fast 500 index which is a news instead of story. The index is an annual ranking of the fastest growing Asia Pacific companies in the hardware, software, communications, media, life sciences and clean technology industries, with the firms selected based on their percentage of fiscal year revenue growth over three years.
I think the question that raise up also a bit funny la. All time up, kena attack, no up kena attack. Instead go left go right. Focus on the long term and see the possibility.
Whoever invested in company should more focusing and leveraging on 5G technology, cloud and data analytics, Which is the next BIG thing to go on."

With the exponential growth of IoT demand expected to continue over the next five years, the time to prepare for the future of wireless is now. The new breakthrough in IoT technology is fifth generation (5G) wireless. 5G wireless is significantly faster than previous models. The improvement in pace and decrease in latency opens up new opportunities for change and innovation.
IoT is in growth stage and there are significant revenues to be attained, even in the components segment of the market. The subject matter of this study is critical for decision-makers along the value chain, within the IoT industry. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and smart home devices and innovations in sensor technologies are primarily supporting growth in the market.
The interoperability and interconnectivity that Industry 4.0 provides on the production floor is expected to determine the future of manufacturing operations and processes.
Factory properties, such as edge devices, legacy equipment and IoT hardware, must link to physical networks in order to implement an interconnected tomorrow. Interconnectivity necessitates significant improvements to the wireless networking infrastructure used in greenfield and brownfield facilities."

In an exchange filing, ARB said this was mainly due to the negative goodwill of RM12.7 million.
Its Q2 revenue decreased 15.5 per cent to RM46.75 million from RM55.34 million.
For the first six-month period, ARB's net profit rose 51.3 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to RM23.0 million from RM15.2 million, while revenue improved by 8.5 per cent to RM96.2 million from RM88.7 million.
ARB executive director Datuk Seri Larry Liew Kok Leong said the company had taken advantage of its strong cash position to acquire its business partner who is struggling with cash flow issues amidst the Covid-19 pandemic.
""The company has managed to maintain its profitability despite the severe impact of the resurgence of Covid-19 pandemic and the re-implementation of the Movement Control Order (MCO).""
""I think the global healthcare crisis has created an unprecedented opportunity for us as the valuation of companies and assets have come down from its peak before the pandemic.
""We have benefitted from the strong cash position that enables us to obtain a bargain acquisition. We are convinced that the company will recover strongly going forward as the global vaccination rollout continues and the world adjusts to the new normal. This will help to drive growth forward,"" he added."

Today, with various methods of data storage like private, public, hybrid and on-premise storage methods, collecting and storing data is no longer a challenging task. But with such massive amounts of data to handle, the ability of enterprises to harness, analyze, and take quick business decisions has become increasingly complex. To bridge this gap between the big data expertise to bigger data readiness, data fabrics are a clear winner.
Data fabric does the conversion of raw data sets to the most appropriate, actionable and worth investing data insights. Many companies have evolved from the traditional methods of data preparation techniques to providing insightful approaches.
One such approach is called the K2View approach. In this approach, a patented micro-DB methodology is used to store data through a digital entity wherein every entity represents a specific business partner. Every time the fabric captures data, the schema processes and distributes it into a micro-DB. While every micro-DB represents a specific digital entity, it is encrypted with a primary key thereby ensuring highly configurable data synchronization. With a focus on making applications smarter, be it domestic or industrial, the data fabric performs end-to-end automation of the data preparation pipeline.
Data Fabric for IIoT: Weaving The Right Architecture for the Industrial Floor
Data is the core of the evolution of predictive models. While capturing & storing more data is just one part of it, distilling and refining it into a valuable asset class is a real challenge. With data fabrics, this data is filtered at an early stage thereby making it easier to prepare the data. This means, collecting, integrating, analyzing, and archiving data are all performed, automatically. Not to miss, the process evolves gradually and as the models understand the raw data; their performance in automating the industrial equipment improves too. According to data fabric analysis, the fabric also helps in the transition from manual monitoring to the self-governed evaluation of detecting abnormalities.
Over a period, these models would mature into prescriptive entities that execute guidelines more accurately and have an impact on the physical world. Next comes the on-demand deployment of predictive models for a wide variety of industrial use cases. Hosted in the cloud, these models would be accessible from anywhere to the business requirements. Ultimately, these models will lay the foundation for enhanced automation wherein industrial processes learn and repair themselves.
Data Fabric for Edge: Optimize Communication With The Core
While we are discussing IoT, Edge deserves a mention too. After all, the technology’s disruptive demand cannot be met without fabrics. Now the edge is bound to grow because it is easier to build sustainable IoT in a location that is geographically closer to its end customers. This reflects the bottom line costs due to the lesser number of sensors and other essential devices. Moreover, it is easier to monitor the distributed computations across the edge clusters and the core.
One of the major issues with edge computing is also now resolved. For many years, edge computing did not get mainstream partially because of insufficiencies in real-time data preparation and partially because of the unforeseen environmental conditions that may vary from edge-to-edge. While fabrics have addressed the data preparation issues, improved quality of the hardware is doing the essential data processing. The high-quality hardware casing ensures uninterrupted operations in different conditions, no matter how extreme they are.
However, there are additional complexities involved in adopting edge.
The ability to stream data continuously between the core and the edge has now become a major concern. The edge-core communication is a universal business requirement and fabrics have a solution for this as well."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=412","Aug 18, 2021 8:18 PM","neonstrife","Consider the use case of a service that provides continuous & on-demand content to millions of users. Most common examples include video streaming platforms (Netflix etc.), social media or e-learning platforms. Now, to maximize uptime, Edge computing could help in eliminating latency by providing streaming nearest to the end consumers. However, without analytics, the very objective of automated digital services is incomplete. The problem with most Edge solutions is the inability to compute and stream analytics data (customer consumption, preferences, etc.) back to the core and ultimately the business CRM landscape.
Using a distributed data fabric the complexity can be reduced to revolutionary levels. This is a simple and secure approach to provide on-demand data from the edge to the system landscape and ultimately to the sales, marketing & support teams.
Conclusion
It is safe to say that fabrics and IoT‘s growth are interoperable with each other. To make smarter apps & processes, we need to send/receive filtered data at the moment across a network of devices. Automated data preparation pipelines are the potential solution to exchange high-quality data."

IoT is expanding more relentlessly than we all think. The impact is as big and long-lasting as that of the internet two decades ago. There is an unimaginable volume of data streaming across this network and the number of devices expected to join the league needs no introduction. A lot has already been discussed around them. It is not incorrect to say that the data we store and share will cross paths with some IoT networks. Therefore, what we know as the internet is the internet of things from the future.
Among many, the super success of 4G followed by accelerated adoption of 5G infrastructure is a key contributor. Given such accessibility, the most popular use cases of 5G internet hovers around some IoT apps. For example, the ability to drive IIoT ecosystems over a cellular network is a milestone and there’s no second thought about that. Thus, an IoT product development company has an ocean of opportunities ahead.
As per Mckinsey, the initial installations of 5G will value between USD 700 – USD 900 billion. This covers 25% of the world population in the next decade.
Faster Signals At Once
The network consumption of all elements in IoT (elements & apps) could greatly vary, it is essential to emphasize those with strong signaling requirements. 5G pushes for beamforming; a technique that uses signals from multiple antennas and directs them towards a particular device.
While we are at it, stronger MIMO deserves a mention too. The ‘multiple input multiple outputs’ is the metric to measure the data receiving & transmitting capability at once. Until 4G, this was a fair success in some use cases. With 5G, MIMO is massively powerful and supports hundreds of antennas than ever thought. Moreover, devices until now were served based on first come first serve. Unlike before, devices do not have to wait for their turn in the pipeline and multiple of such devices can be served together.
LoRa
Long-Range (LoRa) is a device-to-cloud connectivity spectrum and built for devices that can transmit over a wider area consuming low power. It is the communication layer for the Low-Power-Wide-Area-Network (LoRaWAN) open protocol. For their longer battery life, LoRa devices are widely applicable in manufacturing plants wherein sensors relay data packets in real-time over a LoRaWAN network. Here, the data is analyzed to address key decisions and optimize business operations. Moreover, geolocation capabilities enable asset tracking, optimize various processes in logistics, and supply chain. This is a simple use case of the technology. Ideally, it is a great deal for Industrial IoT (IIoT) ecosystems willing to implement non-cellular wide-area connectivity.
As per ABI Research, LoRa could account for more than 50% of all non-cellular LPWA networks by 2026. The total number of these non-cellular LPWA connections is expected to reach 1.3 billion. LoRa devices excel because they are easily compatible with existing infrastructure.
IIoT wants Large manufacturing units to have a complex design and dense building materials. Most communication signals including the 5G may not reach every part and corner. However, LoRa can penetrate through such materials with ease and ensure an uninterrupted IIoT setup.
Global connectivity via the cloud
A global IoT network is an ambitious project for many product development companies. Such an infrastructure means uninterrupted connectivity to the network regardless of geographic borders or time zones. Until now, the IoT accessibility was limited to localized or at the maximum national level. A global cellular network means uninterrupted device connectivity without changing networks.
Given the vision of the IoT community to build a smarter and connected world, this is a great step. Flolive for example offers cloud-native connectivity of the IoT devices anywhere in the world. From personalized networks to industrial IoT solutions, the globally distributed core network utilizes an IMSI library for deploying and managing cellular solutions.
However, 5G has just arrived and will take some time to fully meet the enterprise requirements to drive high bandwidths and lower latency. Meanwhile, centralized private LTE networks are providing swift connectivity with public networks. That means an enterprise can literally ‘slice’ a network and implement additional gateways each with an exclusive bandwidth & QoS policies for every app.
Conclusion
As discussed, seamless connectivity to run IoT networks may not be a challenge anymore. Just as the internet has reached every corner of the world, so will the IoT-enabled apps and processes. This means enterprises must think beyond and improvise their product scope. Regardless of the connectivity concerns, they should think at the application layer and develop smarter apps."

Increased demand in ERP for industrial operations post outbreak:
The pandemic brought an opportunity for construction players to steer into an era of transformation. Companies are looking to stabilize operations and recapture the growth lost in the crisis turn to technology for answers. According to Gartner, the market for hyper automation-enabling technologies will reach $596 billion in 2022, up nearly 24% from the $481.6 billion in 2020. This indicates a prominent rise in demand for cloud-based resource planning solutions - ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning).
Apart from being the survival kit for businesses in the pandemic, ERP is solving a host of finance and enterprise related challenges such as working capital predictions, cost visibility, enterprise planning for finance, supply chain, procurement, and other parts of the business, as well as financial closing processes and billing models. With access to accurate data and predictive analyses, construction players can avoid unnecessary risk while capitalizing on new revenue opportunities that change from time to time.

For now, what we can confirm is ARBB had seen real profit inflow from both ERP and IOT segment. If you are familiar with the segment, I'm sure you know integration is the key challenge for IOT. Where ARBB had already involved majorly in gaining market share of SMEs and slowly build up concession plans with the government on the IOT, which could see spillover effect to the SMEs part as well.
We always welcome useful comments, looking forward for your understanding of IOT.

Portland, OR, June 24, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- According to the report published by Allied Market Research, the global ERP market was pegged at $39.34 billion in 2019 and is estimated to hit $86.30 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 9.8% from 2020 to 2027. The report provides an in-depth analysis of the top investment pockets, top winning strategies, drivers & opportunities, market size & estimations, competitive landscape, and changing market trends.
Rise in need for operational efficiency & transparency in business processes, adoption of cloud & mobile applications, and increase in demand for data-driven decision-making power fuel the growth of the global ERP market . On the other hand, high investment and maintenance costs impede growth to some extent. However, surge in demand for ERP among small and medium enterprises and technological advancements would create new opportunities in the industry.

Support: RM0.265 (S1), RM0.250 (S2)
Resistance: RM0.285 (R1), RM0.295 (R2)
ARBB had a huge spike in terms of volume and share price on 16th August 2021, which rebounded strongly from S2 to breaching S1 – a support turned resistance and closed at R1. The share price of the company remains buoyant with supported interest on S1.
As of now, MA20 and MA60 had a golden cross on 2nd September 2021. BB remains neutral-positive and share price should wonder around S1 and R1 before breaking out to challenge S2.
Recommended EP: RM0.255 / RM0.260

Answer:
1. you need to understand the many roles of ICPS.
2. You cannot look at ordinary shares in isolation.
3. Just look at one shareholder, Dato Liew if he convert his ICPS to ordinary shares he will be holding 29.8% of ARBB assuming all other ICPS are converted at a later date too. That is for one shareholder. I did not look at the other shareholders. He alone will in the future potentially hold more than the current 27% top 30 shareholders.
4. The next question is why doesn't he convert? The short answer is why does he need to convert now? By holding ICPS the cost of holding and controlling the company is cheap until near the maturity of ICPS. Potential raider will know they need more than 30% to take control of ARBB."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=414","Sep 11, 2021 4:02 AM","swimwithsharkss","@kimi The concept of Top 30 shareholder is straightforward, it means the top 30 shareholders that are holding the shares of the company.
Big corporates oversea might see even lower directed and focused shareholding, the reasons we feel ""abnormal"" in Malaysia is because many corporates in Malaysia are family owned since IPO and will retain shareholding to control the company.
For ARBB, don't forget the company was just overtaken by the new management or new shareholders in 2018 / 2019 and turnaround. Hence why the top 30 shareholding might be lesser by comparison.
Generally this doesn't affect the performance of the company. Hope this helps :)"

5 Trends In IoT Security
1. Another Major Expansion Of The Organizational Perimeter
The IoT magnifies the threat level by several orders of magnitude. We are talking here about tens of billions of connected devices.
IDC estimates that 41.6 billion connected IoT devices or things will be generating 79.4 ZB of data by 2025. Every one of them opens a door to the enterprise.
Vendors have already come out with some IoT security-related tools. But the market remains largely in its infancy. Once the threat becomes more real, vendor offerings will multiply and grow in sophistication. For organizations, this all adds up to them having to secure an ever-widening net.
2. IoT Will Generate A LOT More Data
With the growth of connected IoT devices will come another major rise in data.
There is a debate ongoing as to where that data will reside. Some say almost all will stay at the edge. Others want a lot more of it sent to major data centers. Regardless, data must be secured. Even if it is only information concerning the location of a car for a few moments, anyone being lax on access to that data will catch serious privacy heat.
Whether data is at the edge, in the data center, or in the cloud, all of it will have to be fully secured.
“We see a rise in edge computing devices that will reduce computer power in the IoT devices, but these will need to be managed and secured,” said Ashley Leonard, president and CEO of Syxsense.
He made the point that the impact of IoT will be further magnified once 5G really gains traction.
“5G and IoT will revolutionize the way we work and communicate but most importantly, the way we access information,” Leonard said. “Current IT security models that focus on perimeter security will not be effective when corporate data is exposed by 5G devices connected directly to the internet. Who can see and who owns your data?”
3. Automation Will Become An Even Larger Element Within Security
Automation is already a major trend within security. It is used to trawl through mountains of logs, for instance, to isolate patterns and anomalies.
Machine learning (ML) is also becoming a growing part of security in areas such as risk management, threat intelligence, and security information and event management (SIEM).
But with the IoT, we can expect even more automation. When you are dealing in orders of magnitudes in the tens of billions, there is no way a security admin can be expected to manually cope. Automated security, therefore, will become an increasingly vital part of the security arsenal.
4. The Lines Of Attack Become Wilder
The IoT offers so many new lines of attack, many of which are hardly even being conceived off right now.
Hackers, for example, can take over control of vehicles remotely. Greg Schulz, an analyst with StorageIO Group, adds planes, trains, and transit systems to the list of possible targets. And then you have drones, Alexa or Google devices, smart phones, computers, garage door openers, home heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), other building control systems, elevators, factory systems, warehouses, and robots.
“Most companies have no idea what IoT systems are even connected to their corporate networks,” Leonard said. “This has huge security implications. A casino has already been hacked through an IoT thermometer in a fish tank.”
5. The Need For Standards
Standards are vital in IT. Imagine what would happen if a dozen vendors and another few dozen startups set up their own disparate protocols and systems for managing the IoT. It would become a chaos of competing systems.
And security would become a nightmare due to lack of integration. In fact, the lack of standards could be used as an excuse for failing to secure IoT systems and data.
“Many IoT device vendors each have their own methods for updating security, but there are no standards,” Leonard said.
He gave the example of homeowners. When did they last update their door-lock system, security cameras, or AC? In this brave new world of the IoT, think what those systems might be connected to? In many cases, they are connected to phones that contain the passwords to consumer and corporate systems. That provides an entry point of magnitude into the enterprise.
But if the IoT really takes hold, sensors and devices will be everywhere — in every car, in every device, on the factory floor. Standards are vitally needed to simplify the securing of all if it."

THE National Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia (NCCIM) said the upcoming budget’s immediate priority is to craft a swift economic recovery plan for generating growth, enhancing resilience, revitalising private investment, creating jobs, reskilling and upskilling of manpower.
Its president Datuk Low Kian Chuan (picture) said the chamber had a productive engagement with Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz and his team of senior officials to discuss NCCIM’s proposals for the formulation of the 2022 National Budget.
Also present at the meeting were council members from the Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia, Malay Chamber of Commerce Malaysia, Malaysian Associated Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Malaysian International Chambers of Commerce and Industry, and the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers.
Low said NCCIM had submitted a comprehensive Budget 2022 memorandum containing proposals and initiatives concerning 14 issues and five specific industries under five thrusts.
This includes restoring and sustaining confidence and trust; enhancing the Covid-19 mitigation and containment; securing and accelerating the recovery; building a strong foundation for a sustainable future; and re-energising specific industries.
“In addition, NCCIM hopes the budget will provide support to the Malaysian businesses and industries for investing in the future, by accelerating digitalisation and technology and automation, boosting productive capacity and productivity, and accelerating the transition to environmental, social, and governance.
“We have presented six key focus areas, namely ease of operating costs; revitalising private investment; tax treatment; reinforcing exports and made in Malaysia products; digital transformation and automation; and green growth and sustainable development,” he said in a statement on Friday.
Low noted that the finance minister had responded positively to the chamber’s proposals and has reassured that the government remained committed to work with the chamber to ensure a durable economic recovery and business sustainability as the country’s economy fully reopens safely.
He said Tengku Zafrul had stated that the government is also committed to assist the people affected by the pandemic and support continuity of businesses.
Low said the minister also emphasised that 2022 will be a critical year to jump-start economic and business activities as the government expected to open the economy safely by the end of this year.
Hence, Budget 2022 will be focusing on 3Rs (recovery, resilience and reform) to protect and drive the recovery of lives and livelihoods; to rebuild national resilience; and to catalyse reforms towards the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals."

New report out today – “Industrial IoT in the Time of Covid-19” – finds rapid increase and high level of maturity in levels of industrial IoT in 2021 across global supply chains in agriculture, electrical utilities, mining, oil and gas, and transport and logistics.
New research by Inmarsat, the world leader in global mobile satellite communications, reveals a rapid increase in the maturity level of organisations adopting the industrial Internet of Things (IoT) since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Respondents drawn from multiple industries also reported that Covid-19 has demonstrated the importance of IoT to their businesses, with many accelerating IoT deployments in response to the pandemic.
According to the research, IoT adoption has seen huge progress from 2020 to 2021. More than three quarters (77 per cent) of the organisations surveyed have now fully deployed at least one IoT project, with 41 per cent having achieved this in the twelve-month period from the second quarter of 2020. Of the remaining 23 per cent of respondents that have not yet fully deployed IoT projects, all are either currently trialling it, or plan to deploy or trial at least one IoT project in the next 18 months.
A further 84 per cent of respondents indicated they have accelerated or they intend to accelerate the adoption of IoT in response to challenges related to Covid-19. This figure includes 47 per cent who have already accelerated IoT adoption to respond to Covid-19, 24 per cent who will accelerate over the next twelve months and 14 per cent who will accelerate beyond the next 12 months. The 47 per cent who have already accelerated IoT adoption are less likely to state that Covid-19 has negatively impacted their ability to operate, than those yet to, demonstrating a link between IoT and business continuity during the pandemic. Additionally, over half (52%) of respondents indicated that business and operational challenges related to Covid-19 have underlined the importance of IoT.
“It is particularly interesting, though logical, that Covid-19 has further catalysed businesses to increase their reliance on Industry 4.0 technologies, and particularly the industrial Internet of Things, in order to maintain business continuity. Those businesses implementing IoT technologies ahead of their competition and across their value chains are those who stand to win in the long-term.”
“While our findings point to IoT driving significant uplifts in efficiency, sustainability and safety across global supply chains, there are areas where organisations can make improvements to draw the optimum benefits from the technology. Connectivity, data management, skills shortages, security threats and investment levels remain challenges as the world’s production and supply chains become increasingly digitalised and intertwined.”"

This timber-business turned software company – ARBB had on 23rd September 2021 announced to launch ARB Cloud Cosec, a self-developed cloud company secretary platform that will fully automate the existing company secretary services.
Just to recap, ARBB had previously engaged in the Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) and Internet of Things (IoT) business.
We understand that in Malaysia, a lot of business are not integrated with IoT. Take land office as example, there is a recent riot for law firms to claim that the efficiency is... well, you know how government servant works.
Land office is just one of the examples that businesses are facing lots of resources wastage due to lack of integration with information technology. With the ARB Cloud Cosec, it could enable company secretary firms, public listed companies, and small & medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to automate the whole process.
Bear in mind this does not reduce the need on company secretary, but just to streamline the whole process to benefit both parties.
Interestingly, the executive director Datuk Seri Larry Liew Kok Leong had said in an interview that the ARB Cloud Cosec to create a sustainable recurring income of approximately RM100.0 million per year for the company. Based on FYE 2020 revenue of RM219.4 million, we could expect an approximately 45% increase and when estimated with a 12% to 15% net profit margin, it could be amounted to an additional RM12.0 million to RM15.0 million increase in net profit, which is around 28% to 35% increase in the net profit level.
By right, the cloud expansion plan could increase the company’s share price by the same degree.
Currently, ARBB had an existing share base of 608.2 million shares and based on theIrredeemable Convertible Preference Shares (ICPS) calculation, the maximum dilutive effect is around 1,075,360,000 shares. I know investors are concerned about the ICPS conversion, but if we take a conservative bottom line of RM8.0 million (less than 50% of 2nd Quarter in Financial Year 2021) and normalize for Financial Year 2022, added with the RM12.0 million to RM15.0 million, it is expected the maximum diluted EPS to be around 4.09 cents to 4.37 cents, which is equivalent to 5.94 times to 6.35 times of PER.
When compared to peers such as CENSOF HOLDINGS BERHAD (KLSE: 5195), DAGANG NEXCHANGE BERHAD (KLSE: 4456) and/or IFCA MSC BERHAD (KLSE: 0023) who are trading at 9.73 times, 18.16 times and 19.46 times of PER, one could simply tell that ARBB had a margin of safety of approximately 40% based on the current price level.
I believe once investor fully understand the key concept of ICPS dilution, the share price would experience a premium in valuation and don’t forget, 10 times PER only equates to RM0.410 in share price for ARBB!

Many job will be soon replace by this new technology, not all but atleast half of it would be replace. Can you imagine how about in future when you buy house, all can be done online, they have the system to check all your info, and all SPA and Loan agreement can be sign through online. And for those subsale, as you know some property when you sell, you need to go through the super slow process by our government. Need to wait for their approval , whatever la. You will see that many stuffs which need approval from our gov are super duper slow. What if these process can be simplify even more thru online and fasten up the overall process? For current situation, many agreement that you sign still need sign by your own physically, because they feel that not secure using online. How about in future if they can make thing more secure and convenience. Many manual job will be kicked off. Future is here. Choose the right company. Automation, iot and erp is going big in future. You will have your big smile and no need doubt with money after 5years if you invest 10% of your salary every month into one of these ""futuristic"" company.

The key features include automate manual signing process for approval, easier collaboration with clients, the Cloud feature that enables access to information at any time and anywhere, as well as the instant Certified True Copy of documents.
“With these features, our clients will benefit from the ease of usage, centralised information on Cloud platforms that enables access from anywhere and at any time, automatic digital backup copies and security, data automation with high accuracy, and many others.”
Going forward, ARB is in a good position to expand its business regionally, mainly due to the strong demand and the expected 12.4% compounded annual growth rate of the global spending on cloud consumer experience and relationship management.
“Moving forward, ARB aims to focus on Revenue Cloud and will develop a business strategy to maximise cloud opportunities by initiating additional cloud-based products to compliment ARB Cosec solutions. The strong global demand puts ARB in a good position to expand business regionally,” Liew said."

ARB BERHAD (KLSE :7181) – 非常有趣的发展前景
这家由木材业务转型的软件公司——ARBB 于 2021 年 9 月 23 日宣布推出 ARB Cloud Cosec，这是一个该公司自行开发的云端公司秘书平台，将完全自动化现有的公司秘书服务。
ARBB 之前从事过企业资源规划 (ERP) 和物联网 (IoT) 业务。
大家都知道在马来西亚，很多业务都没有与物联网整合。 最近有律师事务投诉关于土地局的办事效率......好吧，大家都知道公务员是如何做事的。
由于缺乏与信息技术的整合，土地局只是企业面临大量资源浪费的例子之一。 借助 ARB Cloud Cosec，它可以使公司秘书平台、上市公司和中小企业 (SME) 实现整个自动化的流程。
请记住，这并不会减少对公司秘书的需求，而只是简化了整个流程以使双方受益。
有趣的是，执行董事拿督斯里刘国梁在接受采访时表示，ARB Cloud Cosec 将为公司创造每年约 1 亿令吉的可持续经常性收入。 基于 2020 财年 2.194 亿令吉的收入，我们可以预期公司收入增长约 45%，如果以估计净利润率为 12% 至 15%，净利润方面可能会额外增加 1200 万至 1500 万令吉，这大约是 28% 至 35% 的增长。
ARBB 目前的现有股份基数为 6.082 亿股，根据不可赎回可转换优先股 (ICPS) 的计算，最大摊薄影响约为 1,075,360,000 股。 我知道大多数投资者担心着 ICPS 转换的影响，但如果我们采用 800 万令吉的保守底线（不到 2021 财政年度第二季度的 50%）并在 2022 财政年度正常化，再加上 1200 万令吉至 1,500 万令吉，预计最高摊薄每股盈利约为 4.09 至 4.37 仙，这相等于 5.94 至 6.35 倍的市盈率。
若与 CENSOF HOLDINGS BERHAD (KLSE: 5195)、DAGANG NEXCHANGE BERHAD (KLSE: 4456) 或 IFCA MSC BERHAD (KLSE: 0023) 等同行相比，它们的市盈率分别为 9.73 倍、18.16 倍和 19.4 倍的 19.4。 简单来说，基于当前的价格水平，ARBB 的安全边际约为 40%。
我相信一旦投资者完全理解ICPS稀释效应的关键概念，股价的估值将会出现溢价，千万别忘记，10倍的市盈率仅相等于ARBB RM0.410 的股价！

For a great slice of the public, the term artificial intelligence (AI) immediately draws links to pods in the corners of rooms, lying in wait for you to summon them with a “hello,” “hey,” or “Alexa!”
Such a scenario is a prime example of how the AI term can be used to describe a broad range of applications, from a virtual assistant turning on the dining room lights to the processing and analyzing of data points. However, while AI helps the domestic user do menial tasks around the home, enterprise AI is quickly becoming a staple of the technology stack.
Since the start of the millennium, successive companies have been set up to provide businesses with actionable data to inform the future of the company. One such example, following the recent pandemic, is being able to decipher which conditions inspire the highest levels of productivity from a workforce, using data and planning the company’s hybrid working policy as a consequence.
Taking Control Of Things
Such data points can be categorized as nodes on the Internet of Things (IoT). Although I wouldn’t advise you to call any employees “things.”
Regardless, businesses need to start viewing every internet connection as a point to pull data from and analyze, in order to reach actionable insights. Though employees may be a left-field example, basic sensors, cameras, and microphones in meeting rooms are all smart enough to pull data to analyze and improve from.
The global market for artificial intelligence in IoT will reach $21.7 billion by 2026, demonstrating the opportunity that is at the feet of businesses, according to research from Cision released in August.
A market that size is bound to be dominated by service providers, coming to businesses with the compelling argument of, “Don’t invest in your own business. We’ll do it for you.” But those businesses that embrace the challenge and work with these providers will find success.
By creating strategies around connected devices and the data that is being captured, businesses can base new decisions or recommendations on the new information being received.
The Incoming IoT Revolution
IoT can be a daunting concept for many business leaders. But the buzzword that evokes visions of robot baristas and drones delivering parcels is something that needs to be embraced.
That is because every connected device is gathering data that can be used. For example, the only sensor that you’d imagine street lamps to have is an ambient light sensor. However the data that can be pulled from the most familiar of street fixtures can track when streets are busiest, free parking spots, weather patterns as well as the routes pedestrians take in specific areas.
It is that level of data capture that businesses need to tap into. By 2025, there will be over 75 billion internet-connected devices installed around the world, each pulling data at a rate we have never seen before, according to Statista.
But without the right AI and real-time analytics, that data cannot be leveraged fully. We have seen over the past decade how data can be used to predict rising temperatures or be manipulated to sway elections and big public votes.
In the next decade, there will be an explosion of IoT use cases, pulling data for the next generation of programmers, who can harness, analyze, and understand the information these devices are bringing. Companies will need to deploy new global data hub strategies specifically for sensor data and other automatically generated machine data.
The addition of 5G — with its higher speeds, lower latency, and mature network structure — has also led to an increase in devices at the edge of networks, fulfilling basic analysis in order to speed up the delivery of these actionable insights — also causing a shift from cloud to edge.
In such a huge market, there will be lots of places to specialize in. The enterprise market, for example, is already swarming with analytic providers looking to give businesses the data to base future office designs on, but there are always gaps in markets that are underserved.
The fact is the data revolution, and opportunity, is only about to begin. It has barely started by now. That creates a whole new market for businesses to profit from. But those companies that wish to participate need to start embracing the change now and in turn, will experience new opportunities and a new phase of growth.

https://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/post/The-value-of-IoT-at...
t is no secret that IoT offers limitless capabilities, with the ability to transform industries, reform productivity and offer new levels of insight that once seemed unattainable. The IoT revolution is undeniably intriguing, but challenges such as high price points, connectivity issues and infrastructural obstacles can be major stumbling blocks for businesses.
The vision of IoT and the hard reality are very different. The overall time, cost and disruption of building a new facility aren't realistic for some businesses, as many can't remove existing infrastructure to support this new technology. But, with so many companies faced with the same recurring issues, is there an alternative way? Explore how edge IoT and analytics can transform complex data sources into modernized, smooth-running platforms with lower costs, higher value and faster ROI.
Financial challenges
IoT boasts astonishing potential across numerous sectors, ultimately holding power to revolutionize and transform business models. The opportunities are endless; however, they are far more accessible for major players in the field. The infrastructure can be elaborate and complicated with vast capabilities that require substantial investment and an extensive skill set to effectively implement. IoT giants, such as Microsoft and AWS, require immense backing and investment into technology stacks, as well as a workforce with the necessary expertise. These costs can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars, even before an organization obtains any complex data or insights.
The lack of ROI within the IoT space has been widely discussed, fundamentally causing widespread doubt and leading proof of concepts to fail. When considering some of the earlier use cases for IoT, it is far simpler to calculate ROI. For example, there is an immediate cost benefit of using smart meters because the data can be easily accessed without the expense of sending meter readers to sites. However, with industrial IoT, there are many aspects to consider. Savings are more difficult to establish from the outset, meaning a huge investment upfront is difficult to justify and obtain.
Existing infrastructure
Many facilities have been meticulously designed and built at the cost of millions, if not billions, of dollars. Large, complicated and expensive structures are often composed of state-of-the-art machinery and complex components that cannot just be ripped out and replaced by cloud technology with no concrete evidence of reasonable ROI. Yet, it's still the case that many of the existing IoT solutions from market leaders heavily depend on being built in from the start, which would likely result in significant business downtime and disruption.
Connectivity
If the infrastructure behind an IoT project is not extensively developed or does not have reliable Wi-Fi access, businesses may face connectivity hurdles that are difficult to overcome. Organizations must have IoT solutions in place that collect all of the essential data, analyze it at the point of collection, and boast the ability to provide fast and reliable visibility in both remote locations and large factories. Connectivity challenges highlight the true differences between the original vision of IoT and reality.
Expertise
Complex and intricate setups require a specific skill set. Sourcing the necessary expertise can be an issue for many businesses. Many IoT systems in the manufacturing sector are not tech-savvy in the same way that more traditional database users are. Can a company realistically justify hiring a dedicated IoT professional with so many doubts surrounding the cost benefit? It's crucial that organizations truly consider all options and explore how they can access data from IoT devices without the complex ecosystem surrounding them, such as through a streamlined system that can be accessed easily using just a browser."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=418","Oct 8, 2021 6:05 PM","petronasgloves","IoT at the edge
IoT at the edge is about much more than the opportunity to collect data. The concept quickly gains momentum as organizations discover how to access the most valuable and relevant data instantaneously. Businesses now can analyze and modify data at the point of collection and add additional sensors to expand even further on the data. For instance, the solution could be monitoring speed and temperature; however, you may also need to measure vibration. This measurement would require another sensor, making an adaptable and scalable platform essential.
In the smart meter example, certain IoT deployments involve millions of identical devices with one shared purpose. While undeniably still an investment, the principle is simple with regards to connecting multiple similar devices. It is possible to connect tens of thousands of different devices that work differently in today's industrial environment. In these circumstances, organizations must have an IoT edge solution to correctly translate, analyze and measure data in various formats without completely ripping and replacing the existing technology.
Ultimately, edge computing enables data processing on the edge nodes before transmitting the collected data to the central server. This process effectively reduces the volume of data transmitted each minute, reducing the bandwidth and infrastructure costs to create quicker ROI.
Conclusion
The capabilities of IoT deployments are limitless; however, many businesses are unaccustomed to the availability of straightforward, cost-effective solutions that provide data analysis at the edge. IoT at the edge ensures that only the most valuable and relevant data collected is shared in real time, making the entire data collection process more affordable for the business.
While the likes of Microsoft and AWS have claimed their place, most organizations lack use cases to justify the time and dedicated attention. Instead, small-scale solutions with the ability to incorporate big data, edge and IoT must be considered that can also deliver easily scalable opportunities without the need to rip and replace existing infrastructure."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=419","Oct 13, 2021 8:16 PM","Puremind","KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA - Media OutReach - 13 October 2021 - Main Market-listed information technology (""IT"") software and platform provider ARB Berhad (KLSE:7181) (""ARB"" or ""Group"") launches its self-developed virtual shareholders' meeting (""VSM"") – ARB WeMeet to provide companies and shareholders with a stress-free, intuitive and enriched experience.
ARB Berhad Executive Director Dato Sri' Larry Liew Kok Leong (拿督斯里刘国良) said: ""We're excited with the launching of WeMeet, our state-of-the-art Virtual Shareholders' Meeting, that will serve the needs of shareholders and companies in the ""New Normal"". Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have been working tirelessly to develop a virtual meeting solution, leveraging on our expertise in the digital space and our understanding of the importance of corporate governance and engagement with shareholders. We are thrilled that it's finally ready to serve the market, and we have ensured that our solutions are at a competitive rate, making it easier for our corporate clients to shift towards virtual meetings.""
ARB WeMeet are critical tools that will help to revolutionize how companies conduct their annual meetings and engage with shareholders. There are a lot of advantages to conducting a virtual meeting over a physical meeting as it enables shareholders to participate in the meeting remotely easily. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, most corporates and shareholders have realized the importance of the VSMs tool. According to Computershare data, 40% of the Annual General Meetings (AGMs) globally were conducted virtually during the first seven months of 2021 as compared to just 27% in 2020.
ARB WeMeet's offering includes state-of-the-art video and audio experience, role-based meeting views, comprehensive meeting management tools and real-time Q&A functionality.
""One of the criticisms on virtual shareholders meeting is the lack of engagement with shareholders, and the system might be open to abuse. With WeMeet, we are sure that the platform allows for a highly engaging and modern virtual experience, starting with a seamless meeting authentication, a ""Zoom-like"" meeting experience and real-time Q&A functionality,"" Dato' Sri Larry Liew said.
He added that the platform also provides an integrated console to manage all aspects of the VSM experience, including seamless management of high-quality video and audio, streamed from multiple presenters, screen sharing, meeting materials management and voting.
""WeMeet ensures that the voting process is transparent and that the meeting is open for engagement with shareholders."" Dato' Sri Larry Liew said, adding that shareholders democracy, particularly retail investors' access to boards will not be eroded with WeMeet solutions.
Given that all the public listed companies in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Australia would need to organize an annual general meeting on a yearly basis, excluding the extraordinary general meeting, this would provide a huge potential for ARB. Based on the Group's internal target to capture 30% of these market, WeMeet is expected to generate a lucrative yearly recurring income for the Group.
According to Dato' Sri Larry Liew, the rollout of WeMeet in Malaysia is the first phase and while the VSM solution is competitive, he is confident that the Group's competitive pricing and viable solutions that address some of the concerns over the virtual meeting, put ARB in a good position to capture the market. Most of the Annual Meeting of shareholders will now be conducted exclusively online by remote communication. This decision was made in light of the Covid-19, public health concerns and required limits on public gatherings.
""We're also looking beyond Malaysia by bringing in global audience. It is our intention to help these corporates to shift towards digital as it has always been our priorities. Given the potential of WeMeet and the sustainable business model, we believe that this will be a launching pad for us to expand our offerings. We welcome partnership collaboration in Asia-Pacific region to grow our market,"" he said.

https://www.malaysiastock.biz/Blog/BlogArticle.aspx?tid=24912
This article listed 3 comparable companies and I had a quick look at their financials compared to ARBB. In this chat ARBB has been blamed for its share price underperformance due to: ICPS, long overdue AR, operating cashflow not good, high intangibles assets, etc
We will see how much better these companies fare compared to ARBB since their share prices are higher than ARBB:
1, Intangible assets/goodwill as a % of total asset:- Arbb(23%), Censof (37%), Dnex (45%)
2, AR more than 12 mths (non current asset):- Arbb (95mill), MyEg(197mill)
3, Operating cashflow :- Arbb (+6mill), Censof (-3mill)
4, ICPS - no comparison.
Based on the above, in my view the things blamed on ARBB for its share underperformance is just red herrings as ARBB has some favourables compared to these companies."

The most attractive parts :
Despite already seeing rapidly increasing levels of IoT adoption, COVID-19 has emphasised the importance of Industry 4.0 technologies like IoT for business continuity. With the world’s production and supply chains becoming increasingly interconnected and digitalised, those companies producing digital twins of their supply chains and sharing data, are the ones reaping the benefits."

There are, however, noticeable variations in the planned levels of IoT investments between different industry sectors. Oil and gas firms intend to invest the most in IoT over the next three years (an average of $3.2 million), followed by electrical utilities companies ($3.1 million), transport and logistics businesses (£3 million), mining operators ($2.7 million) and, finally, agricultural businesses ($2 million).
Seems like there is huge potential in the oil&gas, electrical utilities sector, maybe ARBB got the potential to dive in?"

4. RATIONALE FOR THE PROPOSED RIGHTS ISSUE
The Proposed Rights Issue will enable the Company to raise funds and channel them towards
the proposed utilisation as set out in Section 3 of this announcement.
After due consideration of the various methods of fund-raising, the Proposed Rights Issue is
the most suitable means of fund-raising for the Company at this juncture due to the following
reasons:-
(i) it will involve the issuance of new Shares without diluting the Entitled Shareholders’
shareholdings provided that they subscribe in full for their respective entitlements under
the Proposed Rights Issue;
(ii) it provides an opportunity for the Entitled Shareholders to participate in the equity
offering of the Company on a pro-rata basis; and
(iii) it will enable the Company to raise the requisite funds without incurring additional
interest expense from bank borrowings, thereby minimising any potential cash outflow
in respect of interest servicing costs.
For information, the Company did not undertake any equity fund-raising exercises in the past
12 months before the first announcement of the Proposed Rights Issue."

Should you subscribe to ARB BERHAD’s rights issue?
ARB BERHAD – The well-known timber transformed cloud player in Malaysia had proposed to undertake rights issue exercise for their expansion plans. Based on my years of experience involving in the retail market, retail investors generally would shun rights issue, and the reason is still unknown even to today.
So as an investor, is it wise to subscribe for ARBB’s rights issue?
To answer this million-dollar question, first we must have a deeper understanding on ARBB’s proposal on the rights issue.
From what we know, ARBB had approximately 608.21 million numbers of common share and 467.13 million ICPS, which would sum up to be 1,075.4 million maximum diluted ARBB shares. For the sake of those who are not familiar with corporate exercises, you may refer to the chart prepared by Mercury Securities to have a better understanding on the company.
Normally, the ultimate figure raised will be closer to the base case scenario, where the assumption is made on no new ICPS converted and all investors opt-in for the rights issue. But just for the worse case scenario, we have the key shareholder of the company, Dato’ Sri Liew Kok Leong to undertake a minimum of 51.55 million shares for RM0.12 per rights share as a vote of confidence for the company.
As you may have already know, rights issue will adjust the share price upon completion and it is advised for you to subscribe to it rather to do nothing, as the price will adjust regardless of your action.
But what are they raising funds for?
From the proposal itself, we know that ARBB had mainly allocated the funds to expand into a key new business venture – hydroponics IOT solutions.
ARBB had made a name in the ERP, IOT and Smart Home space, but it seems like the management would like to take it a step further by venturing into this new business segment. Basically, hydroponic farming is a type of modern farming technique which involves the usage water to replace soil to grow plants. In the absence of soil, the roots of plants are exposed to water and nutrient rich solutions that contain all the nutrients and substances required to grow a plant.
Hydroponic systems can be established in various scales ranging from small-scale hydroponic systems that are set up at yards or balconies of houses to grow vegetables for households’ consumption, to large-scale hydroponic systems covering acres of land to grow crops for commercial purposes. Some large-scale hydroponic farms also set up their hydroponic systems vertically which consumes less space by utilising layers of racks that are stacked on top of one another to grow crops.
As large-scale hydroponic farms are set up for commercial gain, it is crucial to ensure efficiency in managing the operations in order to consistently produce high yield and good quality of crops. Large-scale hydroponic farms can enhance their operational efficiency by integrating ICT solutions into their hydroponic systems to automate certain functions such as injection of nutrients and required substances, and ambient control (i.e. light, temperature and humidity). A hydroponic system integrated with ICT solutions is known as computerised hydroponic system or smart hydroponic system.
So basically, ARBB is set for another stage of growth now. Assuming that all ICPS were converted and all rights shares are subscribed, that would give ARBB a surplus of RM73.33 million on top of RM55.0 million required for the high-growth hydroponic IOT solutions business segment. The management had not identified potential investment yet, but judging from the recent announcement and ventures into the cloud business, it must be cloud related investments.
All in all, this is expected to bode well for ARBB as rights issue will not dilute existing shareholder’s right as long as they fully subscribe the shares, and this could further strengthen ARBB’s growth as well as power up the company for next level growth space. Don’t forget even with the rights issue dilution, ARBB is still deeply undervalued with single digit P/E ratio.
In my opinion, any sell down or panic selling in ARBB shares in the upcoming trading days is an extremely good opportunity for investors to invest in the company. Personally, I aim for RM0.50 as my TP in the midterm post rights issue."

History repeatedly show that the mother share will come down to RI issue price and some time even lower after RI.
Example now you hold 24 cent.
Right Issue price 12 cent.
Normally mother price will be press down near right issue price.
Even before u subscribe right issue, u will paper lost 50%.
If u are so in love and confident with the stock, i think better sell first and buy lower.
It still bad taste, as they already do right issue 3-4 year ago but still want to do it again? Its like doping to the company while diluting smallshareholder and earning.
Plus they do RI to fund IoT hydrophonic project.
As we all know hydrophonic commonly relate with farm in the city where land is limited.
Then why at Gua Musang? Will the internet at Gua Musang will be stable for this project?
This pilot test, they should prove it by utilizing small land in a city then show that it can maximize space, safer product and optimize output.
Finally if the company is in good condition and keep generating profit why need RI? Why there is no individual investor come to invest by private placement?
I believe IoT is the future, the market will grow and can be profitable business.
But this company just keep mopping money from the market without rewarding it smallshareholder."

25/10/2021 08:18 PM
（吉隆坡25日马新社讯）首相拿督斯里依斯迈沙比里指出，在2021至2030年国家农业食品政策下，现代化与智能农业策略将是农业食品领域成功转型的游戏规则改变关键。
他说，研发、商业化及创新将是农业食品领域的发展核心，而通过融资资金、投资奖励及人力的推动，将提高工业4.0的技术采纳水平。
“与此同时，多个政府研究机构、本地及私立大专的合作，也就促成国家农业食品政策成功。
他今日通过社交媒体发布国家农业食品政策（DAN2.0）推介礼演词时，这么说。
依斯迈沙比里解释，农业食品政策符合2030年可持续发展议程，旨在继续推进农业食品领域发展议程，特别是努力改善国家粮食安全。
“这次政策重点专注在提高食品生产者的生产力、收入及生活素质。”
他提到，智能农业也是2030年共享繁荣愿景中的主要经济成长活动之一。
他说，在9月23日联合国粮食系统峰会上，已提出通过农业食品政策落实国家粮食系统转型。
他强调，国家粮食系统必须继续加强，以便更具韧性及可持续，特别是能够应对全球危机及未来的新冠疫情，这包括提高与生产、加工、分销、准备、食品安全及营养有关活动的网络绩效。
依斯迈沙比里说，通过政策框架及行动计划文件，预计在第12大马计划期间，农业食品领域将年均增长4.5%。
他补充，之前推行的国家农业食品政策表现亮眼，农业食品领域在2020年的国内生产总值年均增长6.8%，比2010年增加近100%，同期食品出口年均增长6.4%，从181亿令吉增至337亿令吉。"

By JOSEPH KAOS JR
NATION
Tuesday, 26 Oct 2021
KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia will be focusing on modernisation and smart farming methods as it aims to transform the country’s agrofood sector in the next decade, says Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob.
The Prime Minister said the new National Agrofood Policy 2021-2030 (DAN 2.0) will continue the momentum and success of its predecessor launched in 2011.
He said since the launch of the policy, the contribution of the agrofood sector to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) has seen an average annual growth of 6.8% up to 2020.
“This is an almost 100% increase compared with the GDP growth in 2010. Total food exports also increased at an average annual growth rate of 6.4%, from RM18.1bil to RM33.7bil (during the same period).
“Indeed, today’s agrofood sector provides an added value and has the potential to increase the income of participants in the supply chain.
“DAN 2.0 aims to continue the agrofood sector development agenda, with a focus on efforts to improve the country’s food security.
“These efforts will be successful through modernisation and smart agriculture as well as by strengthening the agrofood value chain.
“The policy will also prioritise efforts to increase productivity as well as improve the income and quality of life of producers,” the Prime Minister said in a recorded speech at the launch of DAN 2.0.
Ismail Sabri said the focus on modernisation and smart agriculture would be supported by financing funds, investment incentives, and manpower to increase the adoption of Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0) technologies.
“Research and development, as well as commercialisation and innovation, will be the pulse of the development of the agrofood sector,” he added.
Ismail Sabri said the implementation period of DAN 2.0, which is until 2030, was in line with the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.
He added that smart agriculture was also one of the Key Economic Growth Activities outlined in the Shared Prosperity Vision 2030.
Through DAN 2.0’s framework and action plan, Ismail Sabri said the country was targeting an average annual growth of the agrofood sector to be at 4.5% during the 12th Malaysia Plan period.
Agriculture and Food Industries Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ronald Kiandee said the ministry is confident of Malaysia’s agrofood sector’s ability to grow further.
“Throughout the pandemic, many sectors suffered a downturn, but the agrofood sector was the only one that showed positive growth.
“With such a comprehensive plan, and with close monitoring by the ministry, the agrofood sector will continue to expand,” he said after the launch event."

DETAILS OF THE PROPOSED RIGHTS ISSUE:
Hydroponics IOT Solutions on 50 acres of land in Gua Musang,
Kelantan. For this project, the Group estimates that it would be able to install up to 4

Based on the abovementioned estimated cost of RM0.275 million per greenhouse and
a total of 200 greenhouses to be installed, the Group estimates its initial funding
requirement for the provision of Hydroponics IOT Solutions to be approximately
RM55.00 million.
=> Example of the potential of this Hydroponic farming:
Hydroponic farming profit in India
On a 5000 square feet area
The margin of profit- 69000 INR/Month = RM 3868 / month / 5000 square feet
55 acres in Gua Musang = 2395800 square feet, potential profit margin = 3868 x 2395800 / 5000 = RM 1,853,390 / month (estimation)

I prepare to hold long for another few years if the growth rates are getting higher and higher.
However, the scarring parts of Proposed RI and its RI price, after heavy conversion of PA last year of more than RM50million, and yet they still need so much moneys. i never thought they go for RI instead they should go for PP as more big fellows knowing them would join them with PP.
Having strong fate in these tech company and suddenly the RI and heavy DIP has erased my dream, last night and tonight i doubt i have good sleep, may be till next week.
To fully subscribe for RI is no issue to me, but the fate to the management becomes so doubtful."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=426","Nov 8, 2021 9:32 AM","gkent2000","ARB BERHAD – The well-known timber transformed cloud player in Malaysia had proposed to undertake rights issue exercise for their expansion plans. Based on my years of experience involving in the retail market, retail investors generally would shun rights issue, and the reason is still unknown even to today.
So as an investor, is it wise to subscribe for ARBB’s rights issue?
To answer this million-dollar question, first we must have a deeper understanding on ARBB’s proposal on the rights issue.
From what we know, ARBB had approximately 608.21 million numbers of common share and 467.13 million ICPS, which would sum up to be 1,075.4 million maximum diluted ARBB shares. For the sake of those who are not familiar with corporate exercises, you may refer to the chart prepared by Mercury Securities to have a better understanding on the company.
From the proposal itself, we know that ARBB had mainly allocated the funds to expand into a key new business venture – hydroponics IOT solutions.
ARBB had made a name in the ERP, IOT and Smart Home space, but it seems like the management would like to take it a step further by venturing into this new business segment. Basically, hydroponic farming is a type of modern farming technique which involves the usage water to replace soil to grow plants. In the absence of soil, the roots of plants are exposed to water and nutrient rich solutions that contain all the nutrients and substances required to grow a plant.
Hydroponic systems can be established in various scales ranging from small-scale hydroponic systems that are set up at yards or balconies of houses to grow vegetables for households’ consumption, to large-scale hydroponic systems covering acres of land to grow crops for commercial purposes. Some large-scale hydroponic farms also set up their hydroponic systems vertically which consumes less space by utilising layers of racks that are stacked on top of one another to grow crops.
As large-scale hydroponic farms are set up for commercial gain, it is crucial to ensure efficiency in managing the operations in order to consistently produce high yield and good quality of crops. Large-scale hydroponic farms can enhance their operational efficiency by integrating ICT solutions into their hydroponic systems to automate certain functions such as injection of nutrients and required substances, and ambient control (i.e. light, temperature and humidity). A hydroponic system integrated with ICT solutions is known as computerised hydroponic system or smart hydroponic system.
So basically, ARBB is set for another stage of growth now. Assuming that all ICPS were converted and all rights shares are subscribed, that would give ARBB a surplus of RM73.33 million on top of RM55.0 million required for the high-growth hydroponic IOT solutions business segment. The management had not identified potential investment yet, but judging from the recent announcement and ventures into the cloud business, it must be cloud related investments.
All in all, this is expected to bode well for ARBB as rights issue will not dilute existing shareholder’s right as long as they fully subscribe the shares, and this could further strengthen ARBB’s growth as well as power up the company for next level growth space. Don’t forget even with the rights issue dilution, ARBB is still deeply undervalued with single digit P/E ratio.
In my opinion, any sell down or panic selling in ARBB shares in the upcoming trading days is an extremely good opportunity for investors to invest in the company. Personally, I aim for RM0.50 as my TP in the midterm post rights issue."

Recommendation 4: Assisting more SMEs
The 12MP document paid scant attention to identifying the most critical issues facing Malaysia’s 1.15 million SMEs. Academic research into the problems SMEs face today indicate liquidity issues and the inability to grow; lack of access to appropriate technology; the inability to develop relevant skill sets; and lack of ability to collect market information and gain customers. Past government programmes to assist SMEs have only reached a small number of those in need.
One of the problems is the limited reach of government initiatives, while another problem is the lack of effectiveness. Too many SMEs have found the conditions to obtain assistance too difficult, and banks have imposed strict loan conditions such as collateral, support documentation and past performance records to qualify for loans. The national liquidity squeeze due to delayed payment in both the public and private sectors requires a practical solution. Rather than create another agency to assist contractors to get paid quicker from the government, a national factoring scheme could be put into place to expedite quicker payments and increase the velocity of money around the economy. SME proprietors do not have time to attend full-time vocational courses as they are working full time. There should be a radical shift in education towards part-time to teach basic SME finance, management, marketing and technology skills. It is also well worth studying how the Thai government assisted the development of SMEs through the One Tambon One Product (OTOP) scheme, when it was in operation, in arranging trade fairs as well as travel expos to new markets and customers, and developing online business models.
Industry 4.0 and digitisation are well and good once the nation’s SMEs develop a critical level of health, are skilled up and ready to expand. Unfortunately, for most of Malaysia’s SMEs, they are not ready now."

KUCHING: The usage of the Internet of Things (IoT) creates a win-win situation for a company’s bottom-line and green score as there is increasing emphasis on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters.
Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd’s research team (Kenanga Research) highlighted this in a sector review following its latest Webinar Series titled ‘Internet of Things – Opportunities aplenty for Malaysia’ with Malaysia IoT Association chairman James Lai.
“Implementing IoT in the industrial environment can reduce operating costs like electricity. Sensors can be installed in manufacturing facilities to monitor the temperature in real time and adjust the chiller system to an optimal setting instead of running at peak power throughout the day.
“This creates a win-win situation for the company’s bottom-line and green score as there is increasing emphasis on ESG,” it said.
However, it pointed out that the adoption of IoT is still largely in its infancy due to conventional mindset, high investment cost and limited technical knowledge.
“While many are aware of the potential benefits of implementing IoT in the industrial environment, adoption is still largely in its infancy. Implementing IoT would entail up-skilling the existing workforce and revamping an organisation’s modus operandi which many senior managements and decision makers are most often than not reluctant to do so.
“Not helping either is the constant pressure from investors who are only fixated on quarterly profit growth which could discourage organisations from investing in new technology such as IoT,” it explained.
“To continue pushing the adoption of IoT in such an environment, system integrators came up with a few business models such as subscription based – where customer pays a monthly recurring fee which includes implementation and maintenance on a regular schedule, outcome based – moving away from the selling and responding to maintenance call, to selling system uptime and not charging during system downtime, asset-sharing – involves a minimum or free implementation with the exception of data sharing between customer and system integrator, and razor blade model – where a dependable good are sold at cost or loss to increase sales of its complementary good which generates high margin (such as Amazon Dash),” it added.
When asked about solutions to improve the adoption rate of IoT in the local industrial sector, Lai mentioned that the government should continue to provide grants to encourage adoption among local businesses, especially among SMEs.
He also noted that it is imperative to have a sustainable ecosystem where there is an open community data framework for data sharing to prevent the occurrence of information silos and an open innovation framework for a common technology platform.
With announcement of Budget 2022 around the corner, Lai is optimistic that the government will offer more goodies to incentivise the local IoT market.
Meanwhile, Kenanga Research said it believed that against a backdrop of increasing mobile competition from a lack of network differentiation (all telcos will be leasing 5G network capacity from Digital Nasional Bhd’s Single Wholesale Network), and a need for new sources of revenue growth, telcos will be looking to provide enterprises with not only IoT connectivity, but also the IoT application/use cases to the end user.
“We think that the telcos will become system integrators, where they will source/develop the necessary software and hardware for an end-to-end IoT experience for the users."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=427","Nov 9, 2021 11:46 AM","neonstrife","“Thus, in-line with James’ thinking, we wouldn’t be surprised of future telco acquisitions/partnerships with firms that provide IoT capabilities.
“While we foresee gradual revenue growth from enterprise solutions in the near future, we think that the telcos will start to experience meaningful enterprise revenue contribution from FY24 and beyond, driven by a maturing 5G ecosystem, more advanced IoT R&D, and greater IoT adoption,” it opined.
Similar to existing IoT solutions, it also believe certain 5G-enabled IoT applications will fetch higher margins than others.
“Solutions which are homogenous and easily applicable across industries will likely fetch lower margins, with potentially higher customer churn.
“In our view, we think that there is a first-mover advantage in providing IoT solutions to enterprises, especially because the first-mover telco would have an edge (in data, know-how and experience) over others to deploy similar solutions to other firms in an industry, allowing the telco to capture greater market share.
“Among the telcos under our coverage, while Digi, Maxis and Celcom have shown impressive progress in developing 5G-enabled IoT use cases, we think that TM leads the pact. TM R&D (TM ONE’s innovation arm) already has an arsenal of in-house developed 5G-enabled solutions across transportation, tourism, retail, agriculture, utilities and public safety,” Kenanga Research added.
“In summary, we think that IoT applications will fuel telcos’ enterprise revenue growth in the years to come.
“More importantly, with potentially more resources at hand (leasing 5G capacity instead of building individual 5G networks), the telcos would also have the means to do so,” the research team concluded."

7 REASONS NOT TO PURSUE SOFTWARE PATENTS
There are many valid arguments against software patents as part of a business strategy. Depending on the particular type of software you’re developing and your business model, some of these reasons might apply to you.
1. THE PATENT PROCESS IS SLOW
On average, it takes about two to three years for an application to mature into a patent. But in the fast-paced world of software development, that can be a lifetime: By the time your patent issues, your software may be outdated, or its code might have evolved significantly.
2. THE COSTS DON’T ALWAYS JUSTIFY THE INVESTMENT
Patent prosecution isn’t cheap, and you should evaluate whether the benefits will justify the cost.
Notably, you might not see much return on investment if you seek patent protection for an invention with a short shelf life — and the rate of technological change for many types of software is extremely high.
3. YOU CAN PURSUE LOWER-COST IP PROTECTIONS
You can use copyrights or trade secrecy (or both!) to protect your software for a much lower cost.
Besides, in order to file for a patent, you must publicly disclose the technique used in your software — which may not benefit your business. By contrast, neither copyrights nor trade secrecy require public disclosure.
4. IP MIGHT NOT BE YOUR MOST VALUABLE ASSET
Typically, you want to invest the most in your core business assets. “IP-centric” companies consider their technological innovations to be among their most important business assets and will set aside a significant portion of their R&D budget for patent prosecution.
But many software companies’ strongest assets are their brand, user base and industry adoption — meaning a particular innovation or patentable feature won’t be as valuable towards their business strategy. In this case, you might prefer to protect your IP using less costly options.
5. SOFTWARE DOESN’T REQUIRE A HIGH R&D INVESTMENT
In addition, “IP-centric” companies typically have long R&D cycles. And because patents exclude competing products from the market for up to 20 years, they’re essential for recouping high R&D investment.
But many types of software don’t require the same level of R&D commitment as many other fields of technology. For this reason, patents may not be a necessary tool to maximize your profit margins.
6. SOFTWARE PATENTABILITY ISN’T GUARANTEED
In the wake of the Alice decision, the patent process is far less predictable for software inventions than it used to be. Even though software can be patent-eligible, the U.S. patent office has created a moving target for meeting the patent-eligibility standards. You might prefer to invest in a more certain maneuver.
7. OPEN-SOURCE MODELS COULD UNDERMINE THE VALUE OF YOUR PATENTS
If your business utilizes open-source software licensing, patents could complicate your strategy.
Generally speaking, you can pursue patent protection for software that includes open-source code.
If you patent an open-source software tool that you developed, you could potentially exclude competitors from distributing competing products. However, open-source models aren’t compatible with typical royalty-based patent licensing terms, and your open source distribution would end up weakening your ability to enforce your patent."

Speed apart, it will give a fillip to AI and IoT
Mobile phone networks have evolved over the years, starting with 1G (first generation), which was launched in Japan by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone in 1979. 1G network was available in the US by 1983.
The first commercial digital cellular network, 2G, was launched in 1991. This was followed by 3G, which came into service by 2001. It enabled internet surfing and streaming of music on mobile devices.
4G, which offers today’s standard services like video streaming, online gaming, high speed data transfer, etc., was launched in 2009. But it has reached its capacity and now the world needs a faster network. 5G was launched in 2019, and it is expected to be 20 times faster than 4G and will support mass IoT (Internet of Things) deployment.
The network capabilities of 5G, which hasn’t been launched across the globe yet, will lead to the next digital revolution. The next generation of wireless cellular tech will see the enhancement of machine-to-machine connectivity, bringing in a new automated society. Technologies such as AI (Artificial Intelligence), IoT, and cloud computing will make extraordinary leaps with 5G.
In the health industry alone, 5G is revolutionising the way medical professionals and patients work together. On 5G’s network, AI will be able to diagnose and develop treatment plans for patients. Soon, robots could be found on farms, monitoring crop conditions.
5G will change almost every aspect of our lives — how we drive, grow our food, and even how we support our favourite sports teams.
Apple, Samsung, Goggle and Motorola have already rolled out 5G compatible phones in the market.
5G is based on OFDM (orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing). It is a method that reduces interference by modulating a digital signal across different channels. 5G will expand the mobile ecosystem to new industries. It will contribute to enhancing user experience through boundless extreme reality, smooth IoT capabilities, new enterprise applications and instant cloud access. With higher data speeds and reliable networks, 5G will boost efficiency in businesses and, at the same time, provide users quick access to more information.
5G for the military will improve intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) systems and processing, and enable new methods of command and control. It would streamline logistics systems for increased efficiency. Every munition, sensor, weapon and robot in the battlefield will be connected and they can communicate with each other.
The way the military would be able to collect, process and interpret data and control devices and sensors remotely will bring in new dimensions to warfare.
In India, 5G is still at a nascent stage, no commercial development has taken place so far. Network operators like Reliance Jio, Airtel, Vodafone Idea, etc., have already partnered with global vendors and are working on establishing 5G networks.
For specific uses
Earlier this year, the Standing Committee on Information Technology was informed that 5G will roll out in India for specific uses by 2022 as 4G is expected to continue in India for at least another 5-6 years.
Mobile users do not need a new SIM for 5G. The existing 4G SIM will work, but with some limitations. Also, 4G phones will work on a 5G network, but not at the coveted 5G speed.
The cost of using data on 5G wireless service will not be that different from what customers incur to get 4G service. 5G technology has the potential to bring data costs even lower than for the current 4G services, industry experts believe.
But 5G will require new transmission infrastructure, including thousands of cell towers and tens of thousands of antennas.

It is critical to have one based on current technology, which makes it easier to share data across an organisation.
Historically, ERP solutions have carried a high cost in the software, hardware, implementation, and training expenses. Years ago, it was commonplace to hear horror stories about ERP projects that were over-budget, crippled business and took double the time to implement.
It was customary for companies and IT departments to be very gun shy of making any changes. Thus, they kept ERP systems beyond their usefulness and are still running such legacy software.
Today, with the many advantages of moving to the cloud, the efficiency of ERP has brought a renewed interest in replacing legacy ERP systems. Many companies using legacy solutions also have several disparate programs, including a large collection of Excel spreadsheets used outside of the system. These external processes create inefficiencies, increase the chance of human error and still need to be integrated into the ERP promptly.
The pandemic reminded all companies that the cost of downtime is enormous — to the bottom line, customer satisfaction and a company’s reputation. Companies needed 24/7 availability and needed multiple employees to collaborate with team members in unison.
Many companies also needed to adapt quickly – by creating new products, retrofitting their current equipment to make new products, and adding additional production lines. Time was a critical factor in designing, production and distribution.
By replacing legacy ERP solutions, business processes can be adjusted to increase productivity, costly server hardware no longer needed, and upgrades rolled out to an entire organisation easily. Over-budget and lengthy implementations are no longer the ‘norm’ of an ERP project.
The first significant step toward adopting a new ERP system is assembling an effective project team. A well-appointed team can help select the best possible ERP system suited to meet an organisation’s needs and mitigate employee resistance.
Assembling an all-star team for ERP projects is critical to implementation success, and it’s important not to take these decisions lightly."

1) no patents yet it’s called tech company - FYI patent is not a nessasary for tech company.
Software tech and EMS is two type of thing.
7 REASONS NOT TO PURSUE SOFTWARE PATENTS
1. THE PATENT PROCESS IS SLOW
2. THE COSTS DON’T ALWAYS JUSTIFY THE INVESTMENT
3. YOU CAN PURSUE LOWER-COST IP PROTECTIONS
4. IP MIGHT NOT BE YOUR MOST VALUABLE ASSET
5. SOFTWARE DOESN’T REQUIRE A HIGH R&D INVESTMENT
6. SOFTWARE PATENTABILITY ISN’T GUARANTEED
7. OPEN-SOURCE MODELS COULD UNDERMINE THE VALUE OF YOUR PATENTS
2) asking money to develop things - and no guarantee that it could be successfully commercialised
Development fee is knowledge based thing. Why does it no guarantee ? Is based on development time.
3) if fail - won’t get any thing - cos Ip are just papers
How does it failed ? Don't you know they are 1 thing in IT industry called [FIX BUG]
4) in the game of IOT - where giants like Google etc are competing
In the Game of IoT, not only google, tencent, grab and meituan, microsoft, arb, censoft is having different type of playrole.
5) dropped nearly 70% from the peak and no one saw it as an opportunity
I am not commenting on this, but IoT is future, Which is true, Else you won't see zoom, blockchain, metaverse, NFT in market.
6) small tech companies usually disappear very fast

6 IoT adoption trends for 2022
IoT Analytics, a leading provider of market insights and competitive intelligence for the Internet of Things (IoT) and Industry 4.0, recently released a IoT Use Case Adoption Report 2021 revealing where 200 executives at companies adopting IoT technologies across 48 different use cases are investing their money.
Key insights:
According to the IoT Use Case Adoption Report 2021, IoT adoption is set to accelerate in 2022, driven by smart operations use cases with a high return on investment (ROI) and by IoT projects in Asia-Pacific (APAC), especially China.
The gap between IoT adoption leaders and IoT adoption laggards is widening, not closing.
Key quotes:
Philipp Wegner, senior analyst at IoT Analytics, says: “IoT adoption is accelerating in 2022 and beyond! APAC and especially China are leading with strong growth rates. Companies there are increasingly focused on new business models and leapfrogging from labor-intensive production to high-end manufacturing.”
Knud Lasse Lueth, CEO at IoT Analytics, adds
“The leading IoT adopters plan to invest more in the next two years than their peers. IoT adoption laggards need to make sure they do not get left behind. As early innovators double down on their IoT investments competitors might be late to the party as our research shows.”"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=435","Nov 12, 2021 10:57 AM","neonstrife","Trend 1: IoT adoption is accelerating.
According to the report, 79% of organizations are planning to invest significant amounts of money into at least one IoT project in the coming two years.
In fact, the average large company is planning to invest into nine different IoT use cases in the next two years. IoT for asset/plant performance optimization is the use case that most companies plan to invest in, with 42% of interviewees planning to invest strongly. Not surprisingly, there is a solid correlation between willingness to invest (further) and overall ROI. Among companies that have rolled out IoT tools for asset/plant performance optimization(i.e., tools that allow users to operate and maintain assets at an increased overall equipment effectiveness), 97% have already indicated a positive ROI.
But even use cases that are less mainstream today are expected to see strong increases. More than one-fifth of companies, for example, are planning to invest strongly into augmented reality in operations (augmented operations).
The picture is obvious: all signs point to an increased adoption of IoT technology in the coming years."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=435","Nov 12, 2021 10:57 AM","neonstrife","IoT adoption trends – Takeaway for 2022: IoT topics will continue to exhibit strong double-digit growth across a large number of end markets, use cases, and enabling technologies.
Trend 2: Use cases that focus on improving operations and assets are on the rise.
While IoT adoption is strong across the board, asset and operations-centric use cases seem to be in highest demand (compared to use cases for a company’s supply chain or smart connected products sold to customers).
On top of the use case labelled IoT for asset/plant performance, the IoT-based process automation use case (i.e., using real-time data from connected assets to improve an entire operational process) and the predictive maintenance use case (i.e., increasing asset utilization by forecasting unplanned asset downtime) are likely to see strong investments in the coming two years.
A core theme fueling these asset-centric use cases is that of retrofitting. Companies are connecting existing, years-old infrastructure and assets and performing software-driven optimization."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=435","Nov 12, 2021 10:57 AM","neonstrife","IoT adoption trends – Takeaway for 2022: Companies are focusing on the software-driven modernization of older assets.
Trend 3: IoT initiatives are becoming more successful.
In 2017, Cisco famously reported that 60% of all IoT projects are failing, with only 26% of companies reporting an IoT project that was a complete success. Organizations are still citing the 2017 study in 2021, although the reality on the ground has changed.
Out of the approximately 1,600 IoT projects in our analysis, 79% returned a positive ROI. The leading use cases resulted in a positive ROI for 98% of companies.
Despite the complexity of many IoT projects (see Trend 6), a number of inhibitors to widespread IoT adoption have been reduced, most notably costs. Prices for hardware have decreased (e.g., the average cost for sensors fell from about $1.40 in 2004 to less than $0.50 in 2020). Software has also become cheaper. Thanks to IoT platforms and cloud services, companies can now procure many required software elements in a modular fashion and via pay-per-use, which allows for costs to increase with usage.
The IoT talent shortage is expected to remain an ongoing challenge for years to come. But as many integrators have built specific IoT business units (our recent analysis found more than 700 active IoT integrators), a solution for that challenge is now available."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=435","Nov 12, 2021 10:58 AM","neonstrife","IoT adoption trends – Takeaway for 2022: The question adopters are asking has shifted from “Will IoT deliver a positive ROI?” to “Which IoT solution or use case will deliver the highest ROI?”
Trend 4: The gap between adoption leaders and laggards is widening.
One might think that companies that have not started their IoT journey will now wake up and close the gap with those that have already adopted.
Our data show the opposite. Companies that have invested heavily into IoT in recent years are increasing their investments even more than the adoption laggards. The gap between the leaders and the laggards is therefore widening and not closing.
The leading 25% of companies with the highest share of rolled-out IoT use cases to date plan higher future IoT use case investments than the bottom 25% of companies.
The automotive industry provides a suitable example of this trend. In 2012, Tesla became the first car company to introduce over-the-air (OTA) updates for its Model S. (Note: OTA is one of 13 IoT use cases classified under the label of smart connected products)
In the nearly 10 years that have passed since, the company has invested heavily, so that today the entire fleet receives consistent and reliable OTA updates. These updates include major feature updates that increase the value for the end user (e.g., environment monitoring, dynamic brake lights, and an onboard music studio).
While Tesla doubled down on this IoT use case, many competing car makers have not even started on this journey. It is reported that, in 2021, major players, such as the FCA group (which includes brands such as Chrysler, Dodge, and Fiat), only provide firmware updates for infotainment systems and no major remote updates to core software.
Tesla’s commitment to OTA and other IoT use cases may pay off: OTA enables new methods of monetization, and Capgemini predicts that the share of car makers’ revenue that comes from software will increase strongly in the next decade."

Trend 5: APAC is catching up to North America and Europe.
In recent years, IoT adoption has been higher in North America and Europe than in APAC. But the picture is shifting, and countries in APAC (and not only China) are catching up.
In our latest research, the average large company in Europe or North America indicated plans to invest strongly into seven different IoT use cases in the next two years, while companies in APAC plan to invest into 13 different IoT use cases. Companies in China, India, Korea, or Vietnam are increasingly focused on digitalizing their business models and leapfrogging from labor-intensive production to high-end manufacturing. China is leading the pack, in part because of strong governmental support. But countries including India, Korea, and Vietnam are trying to catch up.
“We will strengthen the innovation drive, continue to improve the industrial ecology, accelerate the construction of new infrastructure for IoT, and deepen application services in key areas.” – Wang Zhijun, Vice-Minister, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China, 23 October 2021"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=435","Nov 12, 2021 10:59 AM","neonstrife","Trend 6: The complexity of IoT projects remains a major challenge.
IoT projects can be complex, and this complexity remains a major challenge for IoT adoption.
A lot of efforts have been made by vendors in recent years to simplify IoT. This includes developing ready-to-use solution templates, zero-touch provisioning device connection tools, and pay-per-use payment models for software and hardware. Vendors have also introduced modular software components that can be used on a needs basis and include connectors to other popular applications.
However, end users in our research still point to complexity as the biggest pain point. Therefore, it is not surprising that the most common advice for getting started with IoT is to perform proper testing and ensure proof of concept before rolling out the solution to the organization or customers. This points to the complexity of IoT use cases: you do not know what you do not know."

However, Fatty Liew is a different kind, never bother investors mind, he cares his reputations and his earnings and moneys, never bother share price at all.
How could he tried so hard and put in so much efforts with 8 quarters QR with super profit, yet price dropped from 0.53 to 0.15 (o.53 to 0.35 still not too bad), but 0.15 then to 0.12 soon is totally unacceptable.
whatever tech business ARBB in has no relationship with the share price. Fatty Liew only concerns the cash of ARBB and how to speedily expense it off to new things he feels good.
Less direction or no direction now.
IoT etc ..he never try to expand and grow it.
as i said, Metaverse IoT is one of the most critical components, ARBB could team up with other to explore more.

(ii) Establishing sectoral-based digital skills development scheme and
digital toolkit to equip and improve the digital capabilities of the current
workforce in the professional service sector by contributing to 30%
uplift in labour productivity across sectors and increasing digital
adoption rate across businesses;
(iii) To have at least five smart cities established by 2025; and
(iv) Accelerating a digitally enabled Government by having 100% of
Government servants to possess digital literacy, 80% of end-to-end
online Government services available, all ministries and agencies to
provide cashless payment option and 80% usage of cloud storage
across the Government in 2022.
Through MyDigital, the Government also allocated an investment of RM15
billion to aid the implementation of fifth generation (“5G”) nationwide over a
period of 10 years which is expected to create approximately 105,000 job
opportunities. This effort will be implemented through a special purpose vehicle
under the Government which will then give them the appropriate spectrum to
own, implement and manage 5G infrastructure. Furthermore, a National 5G
task force was established in 2018 to enhance and accelerate this
implementation. With the new digitalisation targets rolled out, it is evident that
the demand for ICT solutions, including ERP and IOT solutions will increase in
the near future in accordance with Malaysia’s effort to achieve the above
targets."

There is DeFi, GameFi and so many other Fi’s. Yet the elephant in the room is MachineFi. What if machines could be your profit center and economic driver? There is a paradigm shift that I am starting to see in the blockchain and crypto space: the focus on the decentralization of everything and the opportunity of a trillion-dollar machine base economy focused around smart and connected IoT devices.
The internet has changed our lives, yet if you told someone from 1999 that a major share of human interaction would happen online in the next 20 years, they probably wouldn’t believe you. Imagining a blockchain future is a “riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.” We are in the beginning stages of connecting the pieces of this decentralized digital and physical universe that has arrived.
A few of these baby steps are pretty obvious. For one, an application of blockchain that runs as smoothly as a non-blockchain application is a no-brainer, and we’re already there. Next is an interconnected network of smart devices that act as building blocks for this future. This is what the most exciting projects on the market have been trying to tackle.
And this is where MachineFi comes in.
MachineFi describes the intersection of smart devices and finance (similar to how DeFi is short for decentralized finance). Smart devices are already present everywhere. A decade ago, the idea that your refrigerator would talk to your home security camera would have seemed like a very funny parody, but as it turns out, that’s where we are! Who’s laughing now?
A lot of people find this level of connectedness to be worrying since the idea of a robot takeover of the world has become such a powerful narrative in our society. The solution does not need to be disconnecting from smart devices altogether but rather to find a way to add security and trust between humans and their devices. This is where blockchain comes in.
Smart devices connected to the internet are here. Didn’t you drive through the electronic toll booth? Now the challenge is how we live with smart devices without endangering our privacy and giving up the economic benefits of this data.
In the near future, I would be very surprised if smart devices don’t begin to take hold in a more important realm: money. Any smart device that can make people more money is going to take off. That’s why I believe that MachineFi will be successful.
MachineFi is the catch-all name for the ecosystem of smart devices that is beginning to grab significant market share in the world of finance. The beauty of this is that the technological capabilities of these decentralized device ecosystems were never in question. Blockchain has been with us for over a decade, and now we are seeing more broadly applicable uses for it. MachineFi is a stepping stone between today’s decentralized world, a world brimming with potential but lacking in experience, and one where machines are an integral part of people’s economic lives.
Blockchain decentralization and finance are the foundations of MachineFi and will be greater than the sum of their parts. MachineFi upends the traditional centralized finance model and grants financial sovereignty to individuals and their devices.
What MachineFi Means For Business
This sharp turn toward MachineFi — actually let’s call it a smooth turn toward better winds — should be considered by the business world at large, no matter the industry. Previous darlings of the tech world, think wearables like Google Glass or the Apple Watch or AR/VR like the Oculus Rift or PlayStation VR, have nearly exclusively been dominated by large megacorporations that are trying to ensure that their dominance continues into the next era of technology.
MachineFi is different, however, in that it has been preserved in its exciting growth phase. The companies making waves now aren’t incentivized to stick with the status quo of the world, they’re incentivized to break it. Entrepreneurs, angel investors and developers alike can reap outsized benefits. Plus, these people are getting to contribute to things that make peoples’ lives meaningfully better through technology. Take the Industry IoT Consortium’s VAT. It’s not every day that you get to work in a fast-moving and profitable industry, and also create something that makes sure a donor’s heart reaches the transplant recipient safely. That’s a rare thing to find, so it’s not surprising how fast job growth is in this sector.
When we look back a few decades to the founding of the internet, there were dreamers who were imagining a future world that I bet looks a lot like our current one. However, those who we remember today as pioneers are the ones who took the internet from one major adoption milestone to the next. That’s the potential that all of us have with decentralized technology, connected devices and financial opportunities and algorithms. And that’s the promise of MachineFi."

ARB公司（ARBB，7181，主板工业股）的股项自从在11月3日宣布建议进行附加股计划后就暴跌。
该公司母股从11月3日闭市时的27仙，在短短10天内下跌了39%。至上周五闭市时的16.5仙。
该公司的不可赎回可转换优先股——ARB公司PA，也从11月3日的9仙崩盘下跌56%，至上周五收盘的4仙。
ARB公司PA的转换价为20仙。ARB公司PA持有人可以20股转换成1母股，或是以1优先股加19仙现金把优先股行使成为母股。
ARB公司的主要业务是资讯工业，并主打企业资源规划（ERP）和物联网 （IoT）业务。在截至2021年6月底的首半年，ARB公司取得了9625万令吉的营业额，比2020年同期的8869万令吉上涨约8%。
该公司的净利在首半年上涨约5成，达到2310万令吉。值得一提的是，公司盈利增长主要来自高达1271万令吉的负商誉会计盈余。
在建议中的附加股计划，ARB公司计划融资发展其水耕培殖物联网方案业务。该公司建议以1股配1附加股比率发行最多10亿7535万新股，每股发行价暂定为12仙。
在基本情况下，ARB公司预计可通过附加股计划集资7299万令吉。其中5500万令吉用来发展其水耕培殖物联网方案业务。
若以较为值得的现金行使方式，ARB公司PA目前以39.4%的溢价交易。这项类似凭单的ARB公司PA目前的引伸波幅达到46.1%，比母股短期历史波幅低很多。
假设投资者对公司母股反弹有信心，ARB公司PA或是短期的交易工具。由于附加股计划可能需要在半年后才进行，母股反弹或许不会太强。中长期投资ARB公司PA的风险因附加股因素或不低。

How Companies Can Leverage AI and IoT to Enhance Supply Chain Management
There are tremendous opportunities for growth in the food and beverage industry, especially for brands able to harness the power of technology to enhance supply chain operations.
From source to shelf, the rise of Industry 4.0 is transforming the way businesses operate, emphasizing the use of smart technology to unl­ock value in supply chains and optimize processes in real-time. Digital data and the applications of smart devices to receive and transmit data are game-changers for today’s food and beverage companies.
Internet of Things (IoT) technology focuses on connecting these devices—placed inside materials or objects—to the internet to collect data about conditions and surroundings. Utilizing IoT devices can be an effective extension of ERP software for data collection and processing capabilities, with built-in, real-time alerts.
Food and beverage companies that are evaluating ERP software need to consider business operations holistically to ensure their technology investment is money well spent. Due to the massive amount of data collected from IoT devices, analyzing and executing on it can prove challenging – and that’s where artificial intelligence (AI) comes in. AI and machine learning capabilities can monitor and analyze big data, and act on it to automate human processes and support decision-making.
In the food and beverage industry, there’s a high demand for product information that must be continuously provided by companies. It’s crucial to have streamlined business processes, while maintaining full transparency and staying nimble in an ever-changing marketplace fueled by changing consumer preferences.
There are several applications for IoT that enhance the way supply chains operate and through the integration of AI, provide better access to information and more informed decision-making.
How to achieve more informed decision making across the supply chain:
Key benefits of implementing IoT and AI across the supply chain are visibility and process control; automation of manual tasks; traceability; condition monitoring; and faster deliveries. All of these, in turn, reduce supply chain costs and lead times and increase efficiency and speed to market.
Growers
Growers and farmers begin most food supply chains. Utilizing IoT and AI can increase their productivity and efficiency, resulting in better quality products. Clear visibility leads to better product distribution insights and minimizes costs associated with products that go unsold.
Real-world applications:
AI-embedded sensors can provide real-time monitoring capabilities to track key agricultural metrics and enhance data-driven insights and decision-making.
Predictive analytics using machine learning can improve planning and risk-mitigation processes by accurately evaluating various environmental impacts on crops and livestock.
Smart robots can automate tasks such as applying pesticide and fertilizer, feeding livestock, and harvesting crops. Automation of manual processes leads to reduced errors, increased speed and quality, and, ultimately, larger production volumes.
Manufacturing
Manufacturing is an integral part of any business, and there’s often room to tackle inefficiencies and cut costs through leaner processes and full visibility of the shop floor. IoT and AI can provide key benefits.
Real-world applications:
Real-time tracking of machinery and equipment can be valuable for monitoring data and performance metrics. Tracking items as they move through the manufacturing process helps automate manual processes associated with movement between operations and helps identify anomalies in real-time.
Leveraging machine learning to help predict operational conditions and outcomes can reduce risk and improve decision-making.
The ability to monitor the entire manufacturing process from start to finish makes it much easier to identify bottlenecks, enhance quality and reduce waste.
Inventory and Warehouse Management
The continuous flow of products within a warehouse needs to be proactively managed. Inventory accounts for a large portion of a company’s assets, and with high demand for food and beverage products, there are massive amounts of in-bound and out-bound shipments occurring daily. These products often come with short shelf lives, and therefore a high risk of spoilage.
It’s more important than ever to maintain a strong level of visibility and control over these processes and utilizing IoT and AI can help companies achieve just that."

It’s more important than ever to maintain a strong level of visibility and control over these processes and utilizing IoT and AI can help companies achieve just that.
Real-world applications:
Data involving items in production, planned for production, and inventory is available in real-time, making it simpler to manage operations.
Missing components or materials can trigger alerts to ERP software and their exact locations can be pinpointed within a warehouse to minimize errors and delays.
Machine learning models can analyze different scenarios to predict the effect of demand on inventory levels in the warehouse and recommend optimization strategies.
Smart devices can track individual worker performance and help them easily identify products in the warehouse.
Transportation
Supplies are transferred between suppliers, manufacturers, and distribution centers – sometimes thousands of miles – before finally reaching consumers. Ensuring consumers receive products on time, in full, and without defects is no easy task, especially considering all the movement that’s involved.
Real-world applications:
Leveraging IoT and AI can alleviate many challenges associated with in-transit processes. AI-embedded sensors and GPS capabilities can provide improved visibility by gathering data about locations, delivery routes, driving patterns, traffic conditions, weather conditions, and network inefficiencies.
Items can be tracked in real-time, allowing for higher OTIF (on time in full) deliveries, visibility into bottlenecks and reduced costs associated with errors.
Certain items are sensitive to external factors such as temperature, moisture, humidity and light; sensors placed on these in-transit items can monitor deviations and send real-time alerts to ERP software.
Smart devices can also be configured to sense any damages to packaging, as well as other conditions such as temperature. Closely monitoring and ensuring safety of items greatly reduces risks associated with spoilage, costs and customer satisfaction.
Increasing technology investments to optimize supply chains are essential to future growth, ultimately helping food manufacturers scale operations, improve customer satisfaction and provide a strong competitive edge."

1. Salient points from Q3 /2021:
Receivables reclassified as Current Asset meaning the debts are recoverable within 12 months. How is this possible?
Eg. Debtor owes ARBB 10million and the earliest invoice is >12 months. Thus, the Debtor with portion >12 months must be classified as NCA (Non Current Asset)
However, if company pays 9mil now and then immediately place orders worth 9.1mil, technically, the debtor paid old debt but immediately incurred new debt. There is no inconsistencies. To Debtor’s cashflow is unaffected.
Note that Receivables have REDUCED to ZERO in NCA but Short term receivables INCREASED by 44 mil to 112mil. Justified in view that the turnover has increased significantly 19m compared to Q3 2020.
Key takeaway: The biggest risk of bad debts is substantially reduced with ZERO Long term Receivables.

Thus far, bought companies with discounts by RM35million. Think of buying a landed property house in Bukit Damansara, KL at huge discounts compared to neighbours’ market value
3. ARBB plans to have 10 patents filed in Q1 2022. Competitive advantage that rivals cannot imitate
4. ARBB is visible and transparent. it announced new products like “ZOOM like” AGM software. Hydro-ponics investment. These need THIRD Parties to evaluate like submitting to BUrda for approval and Finance Consulting firm to file and announce to public. If ti has much to hide, don’t you think any firm will give vague statements?
5. Rights Issue. Shareholders have spoken! They reject. Likelihood convert the capital raising exercise through Private placements.
Those who hold ARBB PA will not be disadvantaged because Bursa and Company Law disallow it! Period.
Conclusion
Accumulate aggressively. This is recession proof barring unforeseen occurrences such as cunning deliberate fraud. Can happen. Case is Enron. WOrld’s leading Arthur Andersen Audit firm collapsed because of the scandal. The risk is 1 company in fraud out of 35,000 NYSE listed firms. Similar kind of risk in any Stock Exchange.

This report assesses the current state of IoT security and privacy, analyzes current challenges, and evaluates potential opportunities. The report also looks at the need for security for IoT in different areas and identifies existing and needed solutions.
The report assesses the specific hardware and software solutions required to ensure IoT security and privacy. It also identifies market opportunities by security type across the ecosystem. The report also evaluates the impact of IoT security technologies on different industry verticals.
Select Report Findings
The overall security in IoT market will reach $52.3 billion globally by 2026
Distributed denial of service protection for IoT systems will reach $1.58 globally by 2026
Driven largely by commercial retrofits, IoT security in smart buildings will reach $4.55 globally by 2026
The largest deployment mode, cloud-based IoT security solutions will reach $30.33 billion globally by 2026
Network security will remain the largest global component through 2026, greater than end-point or application security
IoT networks and systems often represent a multi-vendor, multi-nodal and distributed environment and are therefore more prone to cyberattacks by virtue of many points of attack. Major concerns include illegal capture and abuse of IoT data which includes users' activities, personal health or financial information, location of assets (humans, equipment, vehicles, etc.), corporate and personal information.
Industrial IoT (IIoT) is an emerging category of IoT which has been appreciated worldwide for its usability in streamlining business with real time analysis. The devices and things used in IIoT are very special and specific to industry needs. For example, sensors used in oil wells and mines are uniquely processed to adapt and stay working in severe conditions such as high temperature, low pressure, etc.
Similar requirements could be in factories where devices, gateways and sensors will be connected to high temperature boilers to cold cutting machines. In IIoT sensors and devices are attached to many missions' critical machines or tools that cannot afford to stop working and need to work continuously. These sensors and edge devices are designed in such a way that they should remain unmonitored and away from physical interference for years.
The analyst sees investments associated with securing IoT growing at a rapid pace throughout this decade. Their most recent studies indicate rapidly growing awareness among enterprise, industrial and government sectors about the importance of securing their products and applications from malicious attacks. Moreover, the will and budgetary commitment to take actions is increasing among market leaders."

The author of a new report from Forrester Research says that the simultaneous growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing usage are interlinked, and that future growth in both areas will be fuelled heavily by regulations to reduce emissions.
“We cannot disassociate the advancements in IoT without talking about the effect on edge,” he said. “They’re not distinct from each other... and the effect they have on use cases is combined.”
The demand for ""sustainability-related service"" will place IoT and edge front and centre, according to Forrester’s 'Predictions 2022: Edge, IoT, And Networking' report. Environmental use cases like monitoring CO2 levels, pollution, and air quality will all be increasingly sought-after, as will IoT systems that allow businesses to manage their resources (think water and power usage) more efficiently.
Abhijit Sunil, the report’s primary author, said that this is a major trend, particularly among larger companies.
“We surveyed the Fortune 200 companies, and 58 per cent of them had chief sustainability officers as of 2020,” he said. “Most of the rest of those organisations had some [other manager] in that role, looking at sustainability.""
It’s increasingly hard to separate IoT and edge from sustainability strategy in the corporate world, Sunil said, and for all the talk about how IoT and edge are moving technology out of the hands of IT and into the line of business, it’s still CIOs that are best-placed to take action.
“How can anyone influence an organisation’s green IT strategy without understanding these emerging technologies?” he said."

Important Updates on ARBB (KLSE: 7181) 3rd Quarter Financial Result
Before we jump into the financial mumbo-jumbo, I would like to say that the results for ARBB had really surprised me as an investor. Not only did they overdelivered in their results, but they had also planted an additional surprise under the cash flow statement, which we would go into it shortly.
For now, let’s first have a quick look on the performance of the company.
Ironically, I had just published another article discussing the prospects and valuation of ARBB. As we had discussed many times on the ERP and IoT business model, we will not bore you with the details in the article.
For their 3rd Quarter performance, the company had registered a revenue growth in both the ERP and IoT segment, which contributed to their top line increment on a year-on-year basis. However, we noticed that the gross profit is lower than the EBIT, how is it possible?
In August 2021, the company had acquired 51% of equity interest in ARB WMS Technologies Sdn Bhd or formerly known as Bluewave WMS Technologies Sdn Bhd and 70% of equity interest in ARB Workforce Software Sdn Bhd. They might have contributed to the bottom line of the company, too, but most importantly, they had created negative goodwill for the company.
Let’s take a look at how Investopedia explains negative goodwill.
“In business, negative goodwill (NGW) is a term that refers to the bargain purchase amount of money paid, when a company acquires another company or its assets for significantly less their fair market values. Negative goodwill generally indicates that the selling party is distressed or has declared bankruptcy, and faces no other option but to unload its assets for a fraction of their worth.
Consequently, negative goodwill nearly always favors the buyer. Negative goodwill is the opposite of goodwill, where one company pays a premium for another company's assets.”
In short, the acquisition of equity interest for the new business of ARBB had positively contributed to them.
By comparison with 2nd Quarter performance, not only did ARBB had doubled their gross profit, but also delivered substantial growth in EBIT, too. It was also contributed by the negative goodwill from the aforementioned subsidiaries.
Now, even if we were to remove the negative goodwill for the company – which would in turn, be unfair for them, the company is still delivering impressive financial results. What further amazes me is their cash flow!
For a prolonger period of time, the market had been doubting ARBB’s financial performance due to their long cash conversion cycle nature. But little does the investors know, the ERP business model is more of a collaboration model, and the lockdown had hampered their collaboration partner, so there goes the cashflow of the company. But as the company and its associates is experiencing growth now, we could see that the cash flow is flowing back to ARBB, and we could see that the company had RM35.32 million in their war chest for now.
So, what about the prospects of the company? I think it was pretty much self-explanatory.
Also, people had been in a hot discussion about the rights issue placed by the company, to be fair, rights issue might churn some weak holders off as they do not have the capacity to invest more into the company. I would like to once again illiterate that the company is trading at less than 2 times PER. No other technology company would trade at such a discount for a prolonged time. So, this might be the best time to invest in the company."

3) if fail - won’t get any thing - cos Ip are just papers
4) in the game of IOT - where giants like Google etc are competing - arbb has to find a real innovative niche.
5) dropped nearly 70% from the peak and no one saw it as an opportunity"

In the International Data Corporation (IDC) White Paper titled “Building a 5G Foundation for Digital Malaysia” commissioned by Ericsson, rapid 5G rollout will provide an optimal return on investment and provide a scalable solution to support future consumer and enterprise 5G demand.
“IDC forecasts that by 2025, there will be 6.2 million Internet of Things (IoT) cellular connections in Malaysia, up from 3.9 million in 2020. This will generate between 1.3 and 1.6 TeraBytes per second (Tbps) of IP traffic as 4K cameras proliferate for use cases in Smart-City and Manufacturing, and in transport hubs.
“5G indoor and outdoor connectivity will enable a wide range of use cases that were not feasible with 4G due to the lack of bandwidth and high latency.
“IoT alone will generate significant IP traffic which further highlights the need for expanded backhaul bandwidth to support both 5G cell sites but also fixed aggregation at factories, stadiums, and various government and Smart City locations,” it said."

It also enables the incorporation of 5G in local industries’ roadmaps that could benefit industries such as energy, utilities, transportation and manufacturing.
In terms of spectrum allocation, the White Paper also proposed some recommendations for the government to consider to ensure a smooth rollout of the network.
It recommended the government to provide flexibility to enterprises for deployment of 5G private networks in collaboration with industry players, according to relevant business cases.
“Factories, stadiums and campuses will have the option of adopting 5G mid-band/mmWave bands and/or 5G new radio unlicensed in the 5Gigahertz (GHz) band. 6GHz is also an important band to consider for 5G."

IDC believes that the government should incentivise system integrators, MNOs and industry specialists to build 5G private networking to benefit from the real-time control and mobility capabilities of 5G, even in indoor settings.
“We envision that these indoor implementations will utilise cloud-native, virtualised 5G Cores on premises or in the public cloud,” it added.
Other recommendations it underscored in the White Paper include for the government to develop an exhaustive, long-term spectrum roadmap for Malaysia that addresses all candidate bands and to list the key actions required to make them functional.
Communications and Multimedia Minister Tan Sri Annuar Musa said the module that will be used by the government in implementing the 5G network will be explained in detail by the Finance Ministry in the Dewan Rakyat today.
He admitted that there is currently a debate on which is better, the multi-system concept, namely the 5G network operated by various telecommunication companies or the single wholesale network system, which only involves a single company as planned to be used by the country.
Annuar said the government was aware that the single provider concept had a history of failure in several other countries.
“Studies have been done on the causes of failure and the information we have obtained so far is that the basis and background of the problems are very different and the single wholesale network model is not the same as what is planned to be used through DNB.
“However, the Finance Minister will elaborate about DNB as it is a company under the Finance Ministry’s responsibility, while my ministry will regulate the spectrum distribution and the implementation of services later,“ he said.
Annuar said this when winding up the debate on the 2022 Supply Bill at the policy stage for the ministry in the house yesterday."

Internet of Things (IoT) is a progressive technology that is slowly transforming the technical landscape. The technology reminds us how devices of varying sizes are effectively joined in a network and passing digital information among them globally. This transformative tool is gradually influencing our everyday lives and every major sector of global business.
According to popular online data, the total number of IoT devices is estimated to reach almost 75 billion by 2025. And by 2027, the market landscape of the Internet of Things is expected to jump over to a whopping $2 trillion.
The global pandemic has introduced certain obstacles for this technology sector, but with the world slowly regaining its normalcy, we can expect some great things from this tech.
Popular Trends in IoT Expected in 2022
Enabling Better Security
A recent study has revealed that the number of devices connected to the internet has surpassed 10 billion. With many devices connected to cyberspace, network vulnerability will be at stake. Attempts to hack the IoT networks will become a common issue. The officials will have to step up their game and take preventive measures for enhanced security. Marketing the new and improved security measures will definitely help to scale the IoT market
Industrial IoT Trends
IoT tech is slowly paving the way for smart industries. The sensors used in IoT technology efficiently detect machinery defects and send data to the respective managers, all before the technicians are assigned to solve the problem. IoT and smart wearables are promoting operational efficiency in the industrial sector. Wearables are linked to mobile devices, which in turn facilitates a connection between the operational floors and the management. Also, the latest advancements in IoT technology are bringing new definitions to the preventive maintenance division.
Expanding IoT Adoption in the Healthcare Sector
The healthcare industry is scaling innovation with state-of-the-art IoT applications. The industry has deployed indoor navigation and tracking on the premises and is encouraging the use of smart wearable devices among their staff. One of the smart applications of IoT in healthcare is used in improving the lighting system crucial for patient recovery. IoT tech is applied to connect lighting systems to health monitors followed by deploying sensors.
As the pandemic prompted us to strictly follow the social distancing guidelines, the IoT technology was used to track patients remotely and even prompted ‘telehealth visits’, allowing patients to visit hospitals by maintaining optimum social distancing. The tech also offered remote tracking of the Covid-19 virus transmission.
AI, Machine Learning, and more
Distributed IoT analytics and data are still prominent in the extensive IoT network. They aid in improved network operations by providing real-time actions while dispatching huge amounts of data into the network core. The consolidation of data streams with leading AI engines and machine learning paves the way for innovations including smart homes and more. To scale the efficiency of data analysis, integrated analytics are increasingly ingrained into solutions and passed over to machine learning applications."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=440","Nov 19, 2021 10:15 AM","neonstrife","Brilliant Customer Services
The IoT technology offers to significantly improve the customer experience by upgrading the CRM systems. The IoT data can be effectively transmitted to businesses’ CRM tools, allowing the organization to be an active part of customer discussions. Since the CRMs come with APIs, they are compatible with most of the systems available today. The networking between these devices will associate IoT tech with the actual business systems.
Beacons and Staff Management
Earlier, beacons were used to drop targeted messages to consumers through smartphones. Now, its use cases are expanded to efficient employee management. Alongside IoT technology, the beacons can be deployed for employee monitoring and to assign tasks to the respective employees. The collected data can be further utilized for boosting operational performance. In addition to this, beacons can be used to promote employee safety. The tech monitors and alerts employees of possible hazardous locations.
The New and Improved Stores
IoT helps to record visitor behavior in stores by tracking their movement and, sometimes, their interaction with the products. The technology also comes in handy for efficient inventory management. The retailers can use the collected data to drastically improve customer experiences. IoT can also promote quick payments and an overall customized shopping experience.
This disruptive technology has begun to influence all major sectors of businesses. IoT has already laid grounds for smart and improved living. We can hope to see more innovative contributions from IoT to the technology landscape in the coming years."

Personalization and automation remain the main directions for improving the quality of the user experience. They also help make the lives of millions of people safer, more convenient, and more comfortable.
Artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have become the main tools in recent years. It is with their help that a symbiosis of functional automation and well-tuned personalization is created. How exactly technologies affect the development of a smart home, we will analyze in the article.
What is AI?
Britannica AI is interpreted as the ability of a computer/robot to perform tasks set by a person.
The use of artificial intelligence in everyday life allows technology to reproduce some of the user’s tasks at an automatic level. Ability is determined by a program that is pre-programmed with a set of machine learning or deep learning algorithms.
AI works 24 hours a day, seven days a week; it does not need rest. It allows devices to perform various functions, make rational decisions, and avoid critical errors.
What is IoT?
The Internet of Things (IoT) is the ability of devices to transmit data to each other over the Internet. Both household appliances and industrial installations can have this property. In addition, the technology allows devices to assess the situation and draw conclusions without human consent.
Integration of assistants
When technologies are introduced into the “Smart Home” system, all the necessary information from the Internet of Things goes to the artificial intelligence base, which already carries out a prepared algorithm of actions.
AI transforms the received data into commands, which, subsequently, are formed into a model of behavior that fully meets human needs. This is due to the ability of technology to analyze the results obtained after contact with a person and predict further options for the development of events.
Assistant integration is ubiquitous, and even giants like Apple, Google, and Amazon adopt them for automation. With their help, users can issue commands to their devices from a distance and ensure that everything will be done without errors.
Similar actions are carried out from applications. It should be convenient and usable and not contain grammatical errors. If you want to develop one of these solutions, you must approach the question as cleverly as possible. Every detail is essential, from the interface to typos. By the way, tools like Fresh Essays, Grammarly, etc., will help to avoid this.
Digital assistants
Today, there are AI and IoT-based automated security systems and devices with voice control from a distance. For example, millions of people use Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant in their daily lives. Through advances in technology, researchers are expanding voice recognition capabilities, which increases the functionality and value of the technology.
Today, users can control devices hands-free, as well as change programs on TV using Bluetooth speakers. But so far the system needs to be improved, since, from the safety side, the results are not satisfactory. Fraudsters have learned how to hack voice-controlled devices.
Benefits of AI and IoT
The main advantages of AI and IoT in the Smart Home system:
the user can turn off / turn on all devices in the house connected to the AI, even being in another country in the world;
all data on the work of smart technology goes to the application on the smartphone, which guarantees complete control over them;
if desired, after the user leaves the home, all smart devices will be automatically turned off.
Also, if a person returns home from work, he can turn on the heating system, kettle, or another device to return to an already warm home and, for example, immediately brew tea for himself."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=441","Nov 22, 2021 11:00 AM","neonstrife","Examples of automated devices
Virtual assistants can find information on the Internet, call specific subscribers and even synchronize with other devices only thanks to voice control. Technologies can be presented in the form of applications installed on a smartphone or embedded in a device using the software.
Let’s take a look at several devices that can be used in the “Smart Home” system, equipped with AI and IoT technologies, their capabilities, and functions.
Washing machines
The use of technologies in the washing machine allows them to adjust the amount of used washing powder or other detergents, set the operating mode, and turn on the device at a particular time. Also, the regulation process can be programmed based on a load of laundry in the drum and the type of fabric.
The system will automatically notify you when the detergent has run out and will send an appropriate notification. Thanks to this, you can save on washing and electricity, while the machine itself will increase/decrease the operating power depending on the needs.
Machine learning technology allows you to study in detail a person’s daily routine, analyze it, and adjust. For example, if a person goes to the gym every three days and marks it on the calendar, the machine will automatically turn on the desired mode for washing after the user puts dirty clothes in it.
The device will automatically determine the weight of the laundry and select the optimal amount of water for it, which will also save money.
Smart speakers
Smart speakers were one of the earliest devices to incorporate AI and IoT technologies. Many models are equipped with voice recognition software. They can also be controlled using a mobile app. Voice commands create playlists and grocery lists, trigger notifications and reminders, and search the web.
Refrigerators
Refrigeration devices using artificial intelligence can automatically diagnose the system, which will prevent premature failure of parts and save money. In addition, the device itself will regulate the consumption of electricity and power depending on the load on the shelves.
Deep learning allows you to control the number of products and identify them. So, the application will display the amount of food remaining, even if the user is at work, which will allow replenishing stocks in a timely manner. Then, based on the analysis, AI will suggest specific recipes, focusing on various products.
The user can remotely get a snapshot of the refrigerator shelves, make a list of products and control the temperature in the refrigerator and freezer chambers.
When a person selects a recipe from the list, the refrigerator can signal an additionally synchronized oven, which will start the heating process at the right time.
Cleaning robots
Thousands of people suffer from dust allergies worldwide, and millions complain about the constant appearance of dust in their homes, which interferes with their comfortable life. But, unfortunately, few people will clean it after a hard day’s work, even from the floor covering, and many cannot afford cleaning services. The robot cleaner allows you to solve the problem with dust and dirt, even in hard-to-reach places.
The main unresolved problem of the technology is the lack of precise synchronization with the home ecosystem, which reduces its effectiveness. But researchers continue to solve it, so universal cleaning robots should appear that can cope with any obstacles in the form of furniture and equipment in the near future.
Door lock system
Thanks to the smart door lock, the user can control whether the door is closed and send a signal about the result to his family members. Also included is the function of receiving a notification when other people open doors, which increases the level of security.
Baby watching
Even if the mother cooks lunch in the kitchen, and the child remains in the nursery, she can always control him using a monitoring system – a baby monitor. Thanks to sound and video recording, the user can always track any movements of the baby on the screen. In addition, most models support Wi-Fi, 3G, and 4G to ensure smooth signal transmission.
Conclusion
Artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) can make the Smart Home system more useful for humans and minimize their contact with devices. And if earlier technologies were a luxury item, today, a much more significant percentage of the population can afford them.
They will help make everyday life convenient not only for those who understand technology; any user will be able to intuitively figure out how to set up devices and automate their work processes.
Everyone can appreciate the increased level of security, reduced energy costs, complete automation, and autonomy of devices. AI and IoT are improving, and over time their capabilities in the “Smart Home” system will become limitless."

在我们进入主题前，我想说 ARBB 的业绩真的让我感到惊讶。 该公司不仅在业绩中表现出奇意料，而且还在现金流量报表下增加了一个惊喜，接下来我们就要谈论这个惊喜。
首先，让我们先快速了解一下 ARBB 的表现。
讽刺的是，我刚刚发表了另一篇关于 ARBB 前景和估值的文章。 正如我已在 ERP 和 IoT 业务模型上多次谈论过，本文章中绝对不会令大家感到厌倦。
对于第三季度的业绩，该公司在 ERP 和 IoT 部门的收入有所增长。 但是，我们注意到毛利低于息税前利润，这怎么可能呢？
2021 年 8 月，ARBB 收购了 ARB WMS Technologies Sdn Bhd 或前身为 Bluewave WMS Technologies Sdn Bhd 的 51% 股权和 ARB Workforce Software Sdn Bhd 的 70% 股权， 该收购可能给公司的利润带来了贡献。 值得一提的是，该收购计划也为公司创造了负面的商誉。
让我们来看看 Investopedia 如何解释负面商誉。
“在商业中，负商誉 (NGW) 是一个术语，指的是当一家公司以明显低于其公平市场价值的价格收购另一家公司或其资产时，所支付的购买金额。负商誉通常表明卖方陷入困境或已宣布破产，除出售其资产价值的一小部分外别无选择。
因此，负商誉几乎总是有利于买方。负商誉与商誉相反，商誉是一家公司为另一家公司的资产支付溢价。”
总而言之，收购新业务的股权对 ARBB 起到了良好的作用。
与第二季度的业绩相比，ARBB不仅毛利翻了一倍，息税前利润也大幅增长。 收购计划所带来的负商誉也带来了贡献。
即使我们现在要消除该公司的负面商誉——这反过来对 ARBB 来说是不公平的，该公司仍然提供了眼前一亮的财务业绩。 更让我惊讶的是该公司的现金流！
由于长时间的现金转换周期，市场长期以来一直怀疑 ARBB 的财务表现。 但投资者知之甚少，ERP 商业模式更像是一种协作模式，而MCO妨碍了该公司的协作伙伴，因此 ARBB 的现金流也随之流失。 但随着公司及其协作伙伴现在正在经历着复苏与增长，我们可以见到现金流正在回流到 ARBB，该公司目前有 3,532 万令吉的储备金。
那么，该公司的前景又如何呢？ 我认为这是不言自明的。
此外，大家一直在谈论着该公司的配股计划。 以公平的角度来看，发行配股将可能踢掉一些无法对该公司进行更多投资的人。 我想再次说明该公司的市盈率不到 2 倍， 在市场上并没有其他科技公司长期拥有这样的折扣价。 因此，这可能是投资该公司的最佳时机。"

IoT Software Today
The IoT software market has been heating up over the past few years in tandem with the IoT device market itself. According to recent research conducted by Market Research Future, the IoT software platform market will be worth nearly $6 billion by 2027, up from $3 billion in 2019.
Organizations rely on IoT software to build and manage IoT solutions. Typically, IoT software platforms include four main components:
IoT application management tools (development, testing and management)
Data management tools that ingest, store, and analyze IoT device data
Telecommunications management tools that help organizations scale as they add IoT endpoints to their networks
Device management tools that allow organizations to manage, monitor, and configure IoT devices remotely
These are some of the key trends shaping the IoT software market:"

Gartner predicts that more than 75% of global organizations will be using “containerized apps” in production by the end of 2022. The firm points to increased demand for vendor-neutral IoT technologies as the main factor driving this trend.
Containerized apps isolate the libraries and configuration files required to run specific applications that may not integrate well within the larger network. This allows organizations with legacy equipment to bring on IoT technology without investing in complete system overhauls.
Another reason organizations are turning toward containerization in IoT apps is security related. By partitioning functions between containers, IoT platform users can be assigned different privileges to specific containers, so only a few team members can make significant changes to files and configurations."

Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) allow IoT software developers to include tools that help organizations automate repetitive tasks and simplify workflows related to IoT device management. For example, machine learning algorithms can link sensors with machines, enabling teams to monitor qualities like equipment condition autonomously, leading to better predictive maintenance approaches and early detection of issues that could affect production or supply chain logistics.
Products like PTC Products’ ThingWorx, a platform designed for industrial IoT (IIoT) management, use machine learning to improve manufacturing processes by analyzing IoT sensor data collected from various points. The platform can then suggest ways to automate workflow processes and enhance machine maintenance approaches through automation."

Increasingly, the IoT software platform market includes vendors that not only offer IoT platforms to be used by organizations directly, but they also offer platform management services. Similar to other “as-a-service” models, IoT (IoTaaS) allows organizations to farm out some of the work involved with IoT management.
IoTaaS allows organizations to take advantage of complex software and infrastructure without investing resources into network architecture hardware improvements, staffing, or expensive software. Microsoft’s Azure IoT Central is one popular IoTaaS option.
IoT software platforms help organizations manage their often complex IoT programs. The best offerings include centralized desktop interfaces that can be used by non-experts and features like data visualization and cybersecurity tools."

https://www.sdcexec.com/software-technology/emerging-technologies/arti...
The global supply chain is in a state of crisis. The holiday season perennially exposes supply chain weaknesses, but this set of circumstances isn’t limited to Black Friday crunches or toy sell-outs. It’s an end-to-end gridlock catalyzed by the pandemic and exacerbated by a hasty and often inefficient shift to a digital business landscape. Compounding factors include massive job vacancies, shortages of shipping containers and clogged ports. In short, it’s a mess.
In response to the crisis, the U.S. Department of Defense and the Pentagon are launching a 2-year effort with a department-wide supply chain resiliency working group that will try to address systemic barriers to visibility and operational efficiency. That’s a worthy effort, and the long-term survival of the supply chain likely depends on it. And yet, retailers don’t have two years. Manufacturers don’t have two years. Distributors don’t have two years. Warehouse workers don’t have two years. And, consumers don’t have two years.
The good news is, the technology already exists to address many of the most pressing issues facing the supply chain, including managing distribution centers, visibility, productivity, accuracy, recruiting and training.
The solution is, like the Internet of Things (IoT), the Industrial IoT (IIoT) has potential to provide companies with advanced warehousing, logistics and transportation solutions, while ensuring seamless process management across all links of complex supply chains. Implement and leverage technologies like IIoT and digitization to revolutionize supply chain operations. Businesses that survive – and perhaps even thrive in – this uncertain landscape will be the ones willing to embrace these technologies.
How IIoT is shaping the supply chain
Visibility and data. You can’t manage what you can’t see. An IIoT technology coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) offer a tool to improve the transparency businesses’ need to understand their existing processes in supply chain operations, discern how to improve them and optimize for success. Placing IoT sensors in the shipping containers can provide regular information on the containers’ position, report environmental conditions and give real-time updates on the temperatures and humidity of a shipment. With the GPS and beacons, shipping companies can track their shipment and ensure shipped goods are delivered on time with little margin for error. With IIoT, visibility comes at both the macro and micro levels by connecting machines, devices, workers, and systems while maximizing uptime, deepening insights into end-to-end supply chain process.
Productivity and efficiency. The supply chain industry – like many other industries – is facing a massive worker shortage. Those who are still on the job are overtaxed and burned out. Instead of simply asking for them to do more, why not provide the technology that empowers them to do more with less? That’s where IIoT can be leveraged. It connects machines, devices, workers and systems, maximizing uptime by measuring and offering deepening insights. Businesses can collect data on picking, packing, routing, receiving and shipping and analyze to make better decisions to improve labor efficiency and machine precision. Businesses can easily identify gaps and eliminate inefficiencies, working toward peak productivity while accommodating worker shortage and reducing burnout.
Automation and modernization. The modern supply chain is all about speed and accuracy. Key elements of IIoT technology such as asset tracking, predictive maintenance and remote production control play a critical role in supply chain automation while lowering operational costs. With automation, manual processes and steps can be removed or replaced to be more operationally efficient and refocus workers toward higher priority and critical projects. Through the adoption of IoT, devices, machines, robots and collaborative robots (cobots) can operate collaboratively with the labor workforce to reduce repetitive tasks that are time-consuming or error-prone and maintain optimum production.
The bare minimum goal: bridge the gap over the next two years until a long-term solution is in place. And yet, when the right IIoT solution is implemented well, it can do so more than that. Investing in visibility, productivity and automation now can provide much-needed relief for businesses, employees, retailers and consumers alike – and those businesses that get this right first will be at an advantage. The technology is here to embrace the Supply Chain of the Future and Supply Chain 4.0."

The metaverse and the future of work
The metaverse promises to create an immersive, interactive and shared digital world that brings together mixed reality – augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) – along with 3D holographic avatars, IoT and digital twins. It is seen as the next great leap in the evolution of the internet with tech titans such as Meta, Microsoft and NVIDIA announcing their vision of this alternate universe. So, beyond the hype what does it mean for the future workplace?
The pandemic has changed traditional office working in favour of a hybrid mix of remote and virtual collaboration. Now, we see a future where a ‘metaverse’ promises to create immersive virtual experiences that could break down the divides between office and remote working.
From science fiction to reality?
Author Neal Stephenson coined the term ‘metaverse’ in his 1992 science fiction novel Snowcrash. In the book, the Metaverse is a collective shared virtual space that combines virtually enhanced physical space with physically visible virtual worlds. It included the sum of all virtual worlds, augmented reality, and the internet. However, the concept could be dated further back to William Gibson’s Neuromancer from 1984 where the metaverse was depicted under a different term: “cyberspace”. Today, online role-playing games like World of Warcraft, Minecraft and Roblox already embrace elements of the metaverse.
While thoughts of a metaverse may create feelings of apprehension and fear, the merging of our physical and digital lives is already underway – we are already reliant on screens and pixels, with many of us living and working behind screens. Like it or not, the tech giants are working on the technology, platforms and infrastructure to make this a reality – even if it is 5 to 10 years away.
Meta, formerly Facebook, Inc., the umbrella company covering Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and other technologies, has made significant investments in AR and VR – including its acquisition of Oculus in 2014. Its Oculus Quest VR headset product line will be known as Meta Quest from 2022. Meta’s metaverse is known as Horizon and Horizon Workrooms and is now in open beta. This is Meta’s flagship collaboration experience that enables people to work in the same virtual room, regardless of physical distance. VR headsets allow teams to interact using digital avatars in a shared online office. This is not simply video calls with a headset – team members interact with avatars, share digital whiteboards and experience directional audio.
Microsoft is also gearing up its own metaverse vision, building on HoloLens mixed reality headset technology and its acquisition of AltspaceVR in 2017. Shortly after Facebook rebranded to Meta, Microsoft announced it is bringing the mixed reality capabilities of Mesh, its collaborative platform for virtual experiences, to Microsoft Teams in 2022. This will allow the use of 3D animated avatars and will work with or without a VR headset. Businesses will be able to build their own metaverses or virtual spaces inside of Teams. Microsoft’s metaverse technology stack includes Microsoft Mesh, Azure IoT, Azure Digital Twins and analytics.
Most recently, Microsoft and Meta announced Teams Integration with Workplace, enabling employees to access content from Workplace within Teams. This partnership brings together two major rivals, and although Teams boasts a much larger paid user base (200 million as of July 2021) than Workplace from Meta (7 million users as of May 2021), it is one step in accelerating the journey to an enterprise metaverse. However, whether people want to mix their personal social media with their business lives, and issues around trust and privacy, will be of concern.
Meanwhile semiconductor NVIDIA recently announced plans for its Omniverse platform, an open-source tool that allows users to build virtual worlds. NVIDIA describes the Omniverse as a simulation and collaboration platform that “serves as a connective tissue for physically accurate virtual 3D worlds”. For instance, Omniverse is used to build digital twins (digital 3D replicas of physical assets) by Ericsson, as the company creates virtual versions of cities to determine how to deploy its 5G networks."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=442","Nov 25, 2021 10:15 AM","neonstrife","Printing in the enterprise metaverse
To realise the enterprise metaverse, there will be a requirement for digital twin technology, IoT sensors and mixed reality. This will bring opportunities to create workspaces that allow for both physical and digital interactions. Companies can already unlock some of the potential of the metaverse through the analysis of data from connected environments, using this to evaluate outcomes, while harnessing AI to improve and automate tasks.
The true potential of AR is already being realised in areas such as predictive maintenance. Here it can leverage ML to track data from past device and predict the future can lead to the replacement of items before failure, or to the extended use of items as failure is less likely to happen. Companies can use the metaverse to identify when a component is likely to fail – and can also optimise energy use and reduce downtime while doing this.
When it comes to the print industry, AR is starting to be applied, but so far mainly on the service side. On 9th November HP announced HP xRServices, powered by Microsoft Hololens 2 targeted at its industrial printers. HP xRServices creates a virtual/real world combination in which customers can connect with HP engineers in a split second through mixed reality, advising them on any issue, at any point of their print production.
Meanwhile Xerox CareAR enables service teams anywhere to instantly provide remote visual AR support for their customers, employees and field workers.
However, the use of mixed reality for virtual collaboration poses a threat to print in an already declining market. For instance, Horizon Workrooms includes a virtual whiteboard where you can use your controller like a pen, either on the physical desk or standing with others at the whiteboard. Also, in a virtual world, ‘print’ may be an electronic process where ‘paper’ is a projection of data into a VR environment. Print manufacturers will need to consider such digital print technologies to participate in the metaverse."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=442","Nov 25, 2021 10:16 AM","neonstrife","The immersive workplace
Although time will tell how the metaverse will redefine work, we are already seeing a blurring of physical and digital worlds. Suppliers must be able to deliver the technological agility and flexibility that the workforce demands. It’s only a matter of time before such changes in technology use cause major changes in how organisations interact with their suppliers.
VR and AR is certainly moving beyond the realms of online gaming and as businesses look to develop virtual office environments, the metaverse may provide the answer to the challenges of replicating physical in-person interactions. Some businesses are already looking to create low-touch office spaces based on digital tools covering areas such as occupancy monitoring, hot desk booking, smart heating, etc.
Creating an immersive experience for remote and office-based workers could improve the employee experience and level the playing field across those physically working in the office and those working from home. Undoubtedly, concerns about data and privacy will be an issue, but it may be one way to foster effective collaboration as employees make a return to working via a hybrid office/home environment.
VR may not be ready today – wearing a headset for more than an hour is cumbersome and until lightweight effective AR glasses become available at the right price, it is likely that AR will remain an environment for the tech enthusiasts and those with highly specialised needs, such as surgeons. Do we really want to interact with poorly managed avatars or holograms where facial mannerisms are not particularly well presented or the person we are interacting with appears cartoonish? Does it mean that once we assume a digital identity in this way all our interactions will be tracked and monitored?
Whether the metaverse signals a dystopian future or not, it is still at the early stages. As with many technologies, it is likely that it will mature rapidly and that users will tease out what makes sense for them, leaving behind many areas that technologists thought would be of great interest. However, the opportunities are vast and we can expect more tech giants, along with a large ecosystem of smaller point players, to invest in metaverse ambitions."

ARB sets up R&D unit to commercialise research, patented technology
KUALA LUMPUR: ARB Bhd (ARBB) today announced the setting up of a wholly-owned subsidiary ARB Lab Sdn Bhd (ALSB), the company's research and development (R&D) unit to focus on information technology (IT) and Internet of Things (IoT) to strengthen the innovation ecosystem in Malaysia.
ALSB had also recently set up ARB R&D Sdn Bhd (ARD) to help ARBB push forward its agenda to develop an R&D centre and innovation ecosystem within the country to bridge the gap between impactful research and patented technology.
ARBB executive director Datuk Sri Larry Liew Kok Leong said the company's R&D unit would focus on building the company's innovation ecosystem.
""In addition to our internal R&D works on IT and IoT innovations, we will also collaborate with local universities in Malaysia to develop an R&D centre and innovation ecosystem.
""Our R&D unit is spearheaded by a group of experienced R&D technical committees who hold various copyrights and patents and are responsible for working closely with the industrial needs,"" he said in a statement today.
He said ARBB's goal is to drive the development of patented technology and help to accelerate the commercialisation of technology, especially those concerning IoT.
""Being one of the leading IoT players in Malaysia, we will be able to nurture strong collaboration and strategic partnerships between research institutes and IoT players in the industry,"" Larry said.
According to Larry, the division will act as a centre of excellence for local universities' researchers as it pushes for a more integrated collaboration with universities to monetise IPs and products.
The R&D unit targets to register and commercialise more than 10 copyrights in the coming quarter of 2022.
""This collaboration will stimulate the growth in the R&D industry in Malaysia as it serves as an R&D centre for innovative solutions and new technology.
""Our business model is to nurture the entrepreneurship of our researchers to commercialise intellectual properties (IP) products,"" he added.
Under the collaboration, ARBB will focus on the commercialisation activities of the IP technology while researchers can focus on developing these patented technologies.
Currently, ARBB has engaged with researchers from various local universities to commercialise the IoT systems and form numerous R&D entities that specialise in different technologies such as the development of cloud applications, artificial intelligence, big data analysis and mobile IoT.
ARBB believes that continued investment into R&D is key to sustaining its multi-fold growth earnings.
The latest collaboration with local universities through its newly R&D setup will play a vital role to build a pipeline of innovative technologies to support its long-term growth.
""The collaboration will strengthen our R&D capacities in IoT's business operation.
""By combining various patent analysis tools on the market with the best of competency mapping, we are confident to deliver a unique platform to identify future technologies and monitor the ever-changing environment,"" Larry said.
ARBB's R&D unit puts the company in a fast-track growth trajectory as it facilitates the growth of the entire value chain of technology, from scientists, researchers, products specialists, sales specialists and relevant networking in the industry."

ABSTRACT
This article offers a qualitative analysis of research misconduct witnessed by researchers during their careers, either by research students or fellow researchers, when conducting or supervising research in their respective departments. Interviews were conducted with 21 participants from various research backgrounds and with a range of research experience, from selected universities in Malaysia. Our study found that misbehavior such as manipulating research data, misrepresentation of research outcomes, plagiarism, authorship disputes, breaching of research protocols, and unethical research management was witnessed by participants among junior and senior researchers, albeit for different reasons. This indicates that despite the steps taken by the institutions to monitor research misconduct, it still occurs in the research community in Malaysian institution of higher education. Therefore, it is important to admit that misconduct still occurs and to create awareness and knowledge of it, particularly among the younger generation of researchers. The study concludes that it is better for researchers to be aware of the behaviors that are considered misconduct as well as the factors that contribute to misconduct to solve this problem.

Keeping it simple, “smart cities” utilize emerging technologies such as 5G and IoT to create and deliver connected solutions for the well-being of a community. While the innovation of 5G technology will not facilitate the advancement of smart cities on its own, the new 5G infrastructure vastly expands the opportunity for cities to utilize smart devices, sensors, and data to improve operations and functions.
With 5G being the newest wireless technology, everything from smart sensors to self-driving cars can now communicate at incredibly fast speeds with low latency and without being tethered to an ethernet cable – resulting in more efficient systems and resources.
So, why is 5G technology vital to the advancement of smart cities?
Public Safety and Security. Officers and emergency officials will be able to locate and receive real-time information regarding accidents and emergency calls from intelligent sensors that are placed throughout the city.
Mobility. 5G networks will provide faster and lower latency connectivity for public transit systems, making it easier for autonomous vehicles and people to navigate cities.
Traffic Management. The combination of 5G networks and IoT devices are expected to intelligently track and manage traffic flows, monitor road conditions, and reduce traffic congestion.
Energy Efficiency. 5G creates huge opportunities for connected devices within buildings and cities to help track, monitor, and control energy. This helps buildings and cities better manage their energy supply, save money, and become more sustainable.
IoT
Along with 5G technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a key aspect to enabling a true, fully functioning smart city. In simple terms, IoT is a network of connected devices that communicate and exchange data – this can be anything from connected cars to street light sensors. IoT technology provides businesses, cities, and individuals with the ability to monitor, manage, and control these connected devices, while also gathering real-time data, analytics, and insights.
Some IoT applications in smart cities include:
Energy Management
Air Quality Management
Traffic Monitoring & Management
Connected Public Transport
Connected Streetlights
Weather Monitoring
Waste Management"

As IoT becomes more ubiquitous, smart buildings are becoming a larger and larger component of smart cities. While building owners and managers have always been on the lookout for new and better ways to reduce costs and improve energy efficiency, traditional building management systems (BMS) are becoming outdated amidst recent technological advancements. Why? Not only do wire-driven networks in buildings reach their data limits quickly, but they also result in higher costs and increased complexities. Today, smart buildings can leverage wireless technology, IoT devices, building automation, and data analytics to evaluate and monitor processes, while also operating more cost-effectively and efficiently.
Through IoT sensors, automation, and remote management, building owners and managers can deploy various devices across a facility to capture real-time data and insights regarding building management and functions, empowering them with unparalleled visibility into their building operations. Looking specifically at energy efficiency, facility owners and managers can now see exactly how and where energy is being used across a building.
Along with energy efficiency, wireless IoT sensors can monitor facility health and air quality. As people begin to return to the office post-pandemic, the importance of monitoring facility health and air quality is significant. In this regard, IoT sensors ensure building managers and businesses maintain a healthy working environment through advanced systems.
Finally, managing IoT security at scale is essential when it comes to data. In order to determine that IoT devices and networks remain secure and operational, asset management is crucial, as it provides regular and essential IoT security assessments."

5G and IoT are both key components for transforming how cities connect and operate. With IoT’s unlimited potential and 5G’s incredibly fast speeds and low latency, these technologies unleash critical infrastructure for the future of connected communities.
Thanks to the rollout and adoption of 5G and IoT, the future of smart cities will be more intelligent than ever – providing endless opportunities to communities that harness the power of edge computing, data, and machine-to-machine technologies."

We see innovation on a daily basis. Without a doubt, one of the most game-changing innovations is the Internet of Things (IoT). Industry analyst firm IDC expects there will be over 41 billion connected IoT devices by 2025.
In particular, the retail sector is increasingly using IoT technology to personalize the customer experience and digitization. However, much of this includes the collection of personal data, which is a target for cyber criminals.
As the connected ecosystem expands and retailers continue to invest in connected devices to increase competitive advantage, let’s explore how these trends will affect security.
Growth opportunities
IoT in retail is a tremendous opportunity to provide a truly customer-centric experience. For example, this might include magic mirrors for clients to virtually try on clothing, cashier-less checkout options, and virtual pathways through a physical or electronic store based on the unique needs of a specific shopping trip.
A better customer experience translates to customer loyalty and repeat business. For the retailer, being able to understand buyer intent helps to optimize the supply chain to make sure the right items are available at the right time for the right customer. Ultimately, through IoT technology, shopping experiences are improved for the customer and more predictable for the retailer.
And yet, with every improvement in technology comes the opportunity for new or unexpected problems.
Some of the challenges arising from IoT
While the technology offers tremendous value for the consumer and the business, IoT implementations should be managed and deployed with a security-first mindset to help prevent data breaches and ways for adversaries to enter the corporate network and move laterally to cause major business disruption. Organizations should make cyber-risk mitigation a part of every transformative initiative from the very start.
IoT usage expands the number of devices attached to a network and thus increases the attack surface. Organizations need to understand how an IoT device works and how it is connected to the network. They also must have visibility into how data is collected, processed, and used. This information is necessary to highly secure the IoT device itself, as well as the software running the device.
IoT devices are endpoints on a network and should be treated with the same consideration as any other endpoint — such as a laptop, server, or phone. One step in helping to prevent the breach of an IoT device is password management. Often, organizations will “set and forget” an IoT device with the default factory password. This practice gives adversaries the opportunity to gain access to the device and potentially move laterally throughout the network.
Another cybersecurity best practice for IoT is having a patch management strategy. This should include ensuring patches are up-to-date and allowing for out-of-band patchability and audibility to eliminate obvious opportunities for adversaries.
Also, it helps to reduce cyber risk by managing IoT with a Zero Trust approach, which means not trusting anything inside or outside of the perimeters and requiring verification of anything and everything. Clearly categorizing types of endpoints is a good way to identify an IoT device vs. a traditional endpoint that is typically “attached” to a human. Using zero trust to manage IoT devices needs a strong cybersecurity engineering approach, so it often helps to align with an IT security partner if your in-house staff lacks this expertise.
Another best practice: The headless or non-GUI (graphical user interface) applications that run the IoT device and collect the data should be highly secured. Using software engineering best practices means that the application is tested for security vulnerabilities and those vulnerabilities are either remediated or deferred based upon a risk assessment.
Next steps
Lower latency and higher bandwidth capabilities will make IoT initiatives more attractive because this functionality speeds processing and thus, business value. Organizations must: be ready from a cybersecurity perspective to proactively manage new and larger attack surfaces due to this increase in connectivity; understand and highly secure the larger number of devices accessing the network; and use automation for the extension of security policies to new types of devices.
While IoT solutions are game changers for retailers, they must be deployed in a thoughtful manner so as not to put sensitive information at risk. Trust and credibility are critical cybersecurity traits that can help businesses withstand cyber threats."

It's worth mentioning that today, IoT hardware is much more accessible than 10 years ago. There are more off-the-shelf products available and custom-build is also easier. Using IoT in animal healthcare is no longer a sci-fi story.
Remote diagnostics
Another use case for IoT technology in agriculture and animal care could lie with remote care and diagnostics for hard-to-access locations and urgent incidents. By allowing a medical professional to access data and diagnostics remotely from wearable hardware, animals can receive immediate help and improvement of their condition. Farmers save time and resources that they would have otherwise spent on veterinary visits.
IoT-based remote diagnostics could also improve pets' medical care. Telemedicine is already a booming market, with startups such as Dogsee.me offering remote services and diagnostic. Enabling professionals' access to real-time medical data would take the quality of care up to the next level. IoT combined with teleservices also offers the potential to bring costs down and make services not only more accurate but also more widely available.
The IoT-fueled future of smart farming
Animal healthcare can only unlock the full power of IoT if data analytics and AI are applied. Suppose we collect data from wearables across farms, analyze this data and use ML and AI. In that case, we can create data-driven insights and build models that work at collective levels and allow for both prediction and prevention.
The sky is the limit. Echocardiograms, temperature and motion data could be captured and fed into an AI algorithm to detect diseases and urgent cases. Computer vision would extract specific movement patterns that suggest disease and illness to prevent serious cases, thanks to early diagnostics. Incorporating a variety of technologies and using them for stream analytics can make insights even more powerful.
Today, we can create digital twins for farms, using real-world data to build simulations and, most importantly, predictions.
Technology can help farmers -- no matter the scale of their business -- predict challenges, improve animal productivity and well-being and increase profitability, which will benefit both consumers and the wider economy."

https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognizant/2021/11/30/5g--iot--opportunity...
Communication service providers (CSPs) are capitalizing on enterprises’ seemingly insatiable demand for Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. Achieving their lofty IoT business objectives is often another story.
To plug and play in — and profit from — an increasingly Industry 4.0 world, CSPs must harness the vast amounts of Internet of Things (IoT) data generated by clients in industries spanning entertainment and healthcare to manufacturing and logistics — and convert this insight into highly verticalized solutions. Importantly, they must accomplish this with user consent upper most in their minds — and within the bounds of an increasingly stringent regulatory environment that protects consumers’ privacy, including General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The risk could be worth the reward. IoT is poised to be a form of savior for businesses of all stripes and sizes and is expected to generate over $1.5 trillion annual revenue by 2030. And according to Gartner, by next year, one in four large organizations will either buy or sell aggregated data on formal online data marketplaces. CSPs have a unique opportunity to monetize their access to vast volumes of data flowing through their infrastructure. All of this is welcome news to CSPs, many of whom face increased competition and downward revenue pressure on their traditional voice and data services. AT&T and others are already marking their territory in this area.
In addition, investor expectations are higher than ever. The loss of short message service (SMS) and voice services revenue over the last decade has been offset by growth in fixed and mobile broadband revenue. Shareholders expect CSPs to continue to invest in next-generation networks (5G and IoT) without increasing their CapEx-to-sales ratios, to continue their expansion beyond traditional telephony services.
The fast-expanding IoT services market is one way that CSPs can further accelerate their growth trajectory."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=449","Dec 3, 2021 9:59 AM","neonstrife","A recent study by TMforum reveals that CSPs see IoT platforms as new revenue streams that do not compete with or undermine traditional connectivity services. But building a platform business architecture requires fundamental changes in thinking and a very different way of operating. CSPs’ IT infrastructures, systems, functions and features will all need to:
Enable the fast, cost-efficient addition of partners and partner ecosystems
Support the flow and settlement of revenue across many partners and in multiple directions to create multi-party trade
Have the ability to scale up and down at levels and speeds previously not considered possible
Provide information to, and use information from, previously siloed domains
Achieve all this with far greater cost efficiency"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=449","Dec 3, 2021 9:59 AM","neonstrife","The task at hand
After watching over-the-top (OTT) content players, messaging and even voice services claim CSPs’ potential revenues, CSPs have a chance to recover lost ground via vertically focused IoT offerings. New revenue-building opportunities are underway, motivating CSPs to rethink their strategies and embed digital into their core business models. This is especially true in the B2B2X market, where IoT will drive efficiency, create value, unlock insights, unleash innovation and enable new business models.
This means that CSPs must create innovative services and applications in vertical markets where there are high-value use cases. Adopting models such as software as a service (SaaS), backend as a service (BaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) for these 5G/IoT offerings will help improve business processes and deliver better services to consumers. Every CSP must effectively determine which set of IoT applications present the greatest potential benefit within the specific markets in which they operate and focus intently on them."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=449","Dec 3, 2021 10:00 AM","neonstrife","Targeting vertical markets
With revenue for pure connectivity services under increasing pressure, CSPs need to embrace ways of delivering new types of services to customers in specific vertical markets such as agriculture, energy, healthcare, logistics, smart meters and smart homes and the like. Many CSPs have already started this journey. Until recently, operators had been limited in their ability to segment network capabilities to serve specific verticals, but this is changing with the deployment of low-power, wide-area (LPWA) networks including LoRA, Sigfox and NB-IoT. LPWA networks are ideally suited to low-bandwidth access applications such as asset tracking and remote operations/surveillance. For agricultural applications, LPWA networks could deliver cost-effective solutions that are simply not feasible with today’s cellular networks.
5G and IoT increase the opportunities for CSPs to create network “slices” that support use cases with varying requirements for latency, throughput, coverage, etc. CSPs envision offering fine-tuned vertical slices sold in SaaS and PaaS models. For example, a connected vehicle likely would require guarantees of latency, throughput, coverage and security.
To succeed with network slices, CSPs must map them against the products that they bring to market (either directly or via partnerships) and the market segments they target. In the IoT space, product categories are classified as “application verticals” and market segments as “industry verticals.” Industry verticalization represents a new approach to market segmentation. Rather than segmenting the enterprise market based on the size of the company, CSPs must segment opportunities based on the particular vertical or sub-vertical that a prospect belongs to, regardless of size.
Network slicing will eventually do away with bandwidth sharing and the unpredictability of existing networks and has the long-term potential to turn such things as real-time analytics, remote surgery and autonomous cars into reality. The same network will be able to run the 5G trump card, Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) – the cellular answer to low bitrate, low-power wide area networks – thus providing interoperability between zero latency and low-power massive machine-type communication (MTC ) use cases in the long run.
Adopting this approach allows CSPs to build a clearer picture of how they can exploit network slicing. Application verticals and sub-verticals can have very different requirements for latency, throughput and coverage. By matching capabilities against different application verticals and analyzing which industry verticals offer the most attractive prospects, CSPs can decide where to focus their efforts and find the right balance between horizontal and vertical approaches.
Therefore, CSPs must target a specific vertical and provide 5G/IoT solutions for many different players in that ecosystem (see 10 vertical industry use cases, below). For example, in the automotive space, CSPs could offer high-bandwidth connectivity to provide a seamless and high quality of service for infotainment, navigation and other services, or explore useful partnerships to leverage specific niche capabilities in smart connected mobility. Low-latency and high-bandwidth connectivity can support “platooning,” where many vehicles with autonomous capabilities drive together in a group, improving fuel efficiency and reducing the number of vehicles on the road. In the future, low-latency, high-bandwidth connections could support remote driving and support (e.g., vehicle maintenance), which will open the possibility of new services and cost savings.
The amount of data from vehicles will grow exponentially with greater proliferation of shared mobility as an alternative to privately owned vehicles, progress in powertrain electrification driven by stricter emission regulations and increased vehicle connectivity. These trends will define new mobility models, and data-enabled services and features where car manufacturers can add data-based business models by monetizing data assets with other stakeholders, such as insurance companies and fleet managers."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=449","Dec 3, 2021 10:02 AM","neonstrife","Spanning the gamut
CSPs are already seizing the high ground. Here’s a sampling:
Industrial monitoring systems. Today’s complex manufacturing ecosystems are connected from temperature sensors to flow meters and beyond, ensuring end-to-end supply-chain visibility, boosting production efficiency and driving cost savings. T-Mobile was one of the first carriers to take advantage of this “IoT in telecom” application. In 2018, the company launched the first NB-IoT network in the U.S. to help industrial companies capitalize on the power of data in their warehouses.
Data management and monitoring solutions. The urban environment provides fertile ground for CSPs, as shown by the large number of “intelligent city” use cases. O2, AT&T, Telefónica, NTT Docomo, SK Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are among dozens of Tier-1 CSPs modernizing cities around the world via IoT-based solutions, enabling companies to automate processes, improve customer experience, reduce time and labor costs, adapt business decisions and generate more revenue streams.
Smart-home and building market. CSPs are supplying network resources and bandwidth to connect heating, utilities, air conditioning, alarms, locks, cameras, pool systems and appliances. CSPs are reselling tailored consumer applications and services for this segment.
Healthcare. In South Korea, SK Telecom partnered with Yonsei University to build an IoT-powered hospital that allows patients to control their beds, lighting and entertainment options. In China, several leading medical facilities are working together on the first 5G-based hospital network standard to optimize healthcare delivery in the country."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=449","Dec 3, 2021 10:02 AM","neonstrife","Driving an immersive fan experience
We recently led a team (sponsored by Verizon and Colt) that built a conceptual IoT-based immersive fan experience powered by 5G connectivity for use in a “smart” stadium. In this case, the CSP provides dynamic 5G network slicing at stadium level, plus drones-as-a-service for aerial video feeds. We envisioned a number of “smart stadium” personas that would benefit from this experience (see below). Key partners on this project included AWS, STL, Subex and ServiceNow.
Leveraging AI, IoT, AR and VR, this experience pulls viewers into the smart stadium, enabling them to interact with the environment, allowing them to view information by persona.
Getting ready for IoT
To meet varying demands, CSPs must decouple and expose services to establish themselves within the IoT ecosystem. They must build platforms that connect ecosystems, or probably more accurately, a series of interlinked ecosystems from multiple CSP partners to create global scale. These platforms must support multiple business models simultaneously, with CSPs deriving revenue from other members of the ecosystem as well as end users, and enabling different charging methods for the end customer, such as connectivity sponsored by a third party.
From a technical standpoint, the prerequisites for CSP entry include:
Network transformation. By moving toward software-defined-networking (SDN) and network functions virtualization (NFV), CSPs have an opportunity to offer IoT platforms at a much lower cost and the flexibility and agility required to lay the foundation for new business models. Stand Alone 5G (5G SA) network) will be required to realize the full benefits of 5G for a greater breadth of IoT use cases because 5G cannot reach its full potential in its non-standalone (NSA) form with 5G Radio Access Network overlaid on an existing 4G LTE network core. But the Stand Alone (SA) form can provide additional capacity and address many latency rates for certain use cases since 5G NR access network is deployed on a new 5G network core. The potential for standalone 5G networks, run on a new 5G network core, is vast. This version of 5G will deliver massive machine-to-machine communication solutions; real-time device-to-device networking; and ultra-reliable, low-latency functionality for things like autonomous devices and next-generation IoT.
Opening the “operating system.” Rather than locking others out of their IoT ecosystems, CSPs should offer the ability to integrate with third-party cloud-based IoT platforms using standard interfaces and protocols to create a path to adoption. Siemens’ MindSphere and Bosch’s IoT Suite are both examples of successful open IoT platforms that CSPs could emulate.
Explore non-private networks that serve the needs of enterprises. Several independent spectrum options, including dedicated IoT frequency bands, shared bands and unlicensed bands, can enable non-public networks. In addition, operators can allocate part of their spectrum assets to support these networks."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=449","Dec 3, 2021 10:02 AM","neonstrife","Three steps to take now
The service opportunities across nearly every vertical business market are virtually endless. To seize the high ground, CSPs should consider the following three approaches. Although they are defined separately, they can be deployed alone or in combination. For example, a CSP might offer a connectivity platform to the entire market, develop specific tailored vertical solutions for automotive and healthcare, and create a digital ecosystem platform for connected home. Ultimately, though, both the connectivity and tailored vertical solutions can be supported through a central digital platform.
1. Build a robust connectivity platform.
CSPs must customize their technology assets to deliver IoT-enabled connectivity platforms. They need a connectivity layer that can handle any data volume, from millions of connections that send only a few bytes a few times an hour, to a small number of connections sending hundreds of gigabytes of data per minute. This connectivity layer should also be able to accept any interaction, from billions of devices periodically connecting and “dumping” logged data into the network, to millions of end points — such as cars — that require always-on connectivity.
Different scenarios also have varying latency requirements. For instance, cars are more connected to everything — from other vehicles, to transport infrastructure, to pedestrians, and to data centers, particularly when operating in “vehicle-to-everything” (V2X) mode. This requires extremely low latency. Different use cases will have varying requirements, which the communications system must handle efficiently and cost-effectively.
2. Assemble an effective digital ecosystem.
Perhaps the most promising approach to IoT is for CSPs to develop a digital platform that enables many partners to add services, features and functions that all participants can use as building blocks to develop new services. These components can cover everything from connectivity to location information, rewards programs, payment processes, specific vertical applications, etc. The platform should also support many ways to share revenue. In short, to be successful, a CSP must first establish itself as a genuine IoT provider and then partner with industry experts to meet key market requirements.
CSPs need a value-added layer that provides easy-to-consume services such as software orchestration, analytics, device management, security, metering and billing that those developers can use to help build out their applications. This layer should also support cloud interoperability, so developers incorporating services from the major hyper-scalers can quickly connect to and interoperate with the CSP platform.
3. Orchestrate your workforce.
Being truly ready for IoT means having the right tools, processes and infrastructure to deliver services at the network’s edge. But it also means having the right workforce, resources and trust with third parties to deliver an effective customer experience. Winning at IoT requires agility in work and mindset, with faster-than-ever innovation cycles and novel ways of working. We suggest focusing on gaining the trust of one industry at a time. Allow partners to deliver enterprise-grade solutions while your organization delivers a secure and reliable IoT core network. That’s how to build trust across the ecosystem. Once a CSP has mastered connectivity, it can act as a matchmaker for industry players that want to monetize their data."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=449","Dec 3, 2021 10:03 AM","neonstrife","Opportunity knocks
With a host of viable use cases across a variety of horizontal and vertical markets, the “IoT in 5G” realm presents CSPs with a unique opportunity to begin extracting value from their 5G investments. IoT in 5G is especially enticing since it means monetizing the enormous stores of customer and operational data that CSPs already have on hand. Concurrently, IoT points the way for CSPs to venture into new industries, offering initiatives and services beyond network connectivity.
An IoT strategy supported by a strong business case for each targeted vertical industry has the potential to share risks and rewards, optimize processes, leverage current infrastructure capabilities and generate unique insights for the business in the form of precise and highly insightful data sets. CSPs should look for service orchestrators to help them strategize and implement the ecosystem necessary to take advantage of the IoT in the context of 5G."

As linked business devices and smart home and workplace gadgets take over the market, the Internet of Things (IoT) has gained even more momentum.
There’s an interesting academic sidelight to this. It’s called the Internet of Strings. Or IoSt. It was created in Berkeley a few years ago by mathematicians. They saw the coming Internet of Things as too corruptible by business and political factions.
String Theory protects free speech and unfiltered thought. Berkeley went to String Theory. This theory is pretty complicated. It’s not comprehensible to most laypersons.
In cyberspace, String Theory creates strings of communication avenues. These avenues can then be utilized. Avenues exchange information. For automation. Or even to make payments using cyber currency. It’s an amazing tool. This tool is just now coming into its own.
It’s not being publicized much outside of academic circles as yet. But the Internet of Strings is something to keep your eye on. Do you feel doubtful about the Internet of Things? Keep your options open, and your powder dry. This is the keen advice of most successful entrepreneurs, CEOs, and techies.
With higher income comes new opportunities for businesses to use IoT.
Watch out for these emerging B2B IoT trends.
1. Voice-Activated Business Tech
With the rising popularity of IoT devices, business-to-customer interactions are evolving.
Consider using modern speech technologies. Siri, Alexa, and Cortana search for items. The consumer orders.
This one area of IoT will explode in the future.
Tech-savvy businesses may seize this chance.
Voice technologies will replace customer service professionals and virtual assistants.
They may improve customer service, offer a seamless experience, and increase efficiency.
2. Retail Data Analysis
Recent technical advances enabled IoT.
Smartwatches, digital thermostats, and smart speakers are all linked and collect data.
These devices are common. They may easily supply data from the retail industry.
Tracking client activity in physical stores may be quite beneficial to business owners.
Data from the cash register, shop cameras, and mobile customer applications may be linked to developing customer care solutions.
The data may be used to optimize labor or inventory demands based on peak customer activity periods of the day or week.
SECURITY 3.
Every internet-connected device increases danger and susceptibility.
Many new specialty cyber organizations are developing, all claiming to safeguard you and your business.
For any organization, selecting the appropriate cyber firm is like “merging houses with someone.”
Insurance is a close neighbor.
Businesses increasingly want to cover their cyber risk, which is costly.
Faster and more selective coverage.
These are industries poised for rapid expansion.
4. Internet Telephony
Office desk phones have become an extremely adaptable communications device.
Making phone calls is merely one of the hundreds of capabilities that mobile phones enable.
Envision increasing proactive usage of social media. Based on location and proximity, marketers and reps get triggered to interact. Queries and problems don’t exist.
5. Property Business
Environmentally friendly industrial structures are in high demand.
Investors are unaware industrial businesses.
You should invest if the building has enough IoT devices.
Inventory systems have IoT sensors and RFID tags.
We’ve got smart shelves and temperature sensors.
These gadgets improve corporate infrastructure. And any building’s worth.
Anyone searching for new business prospects should look at the IoT real estate boom.
6. Retail Seasonal Business
Many individuals possess smart speakers. The majority use them to purchase.
As voice search software improves, more individuals will utilize it to purchase for loved ones.
SEO gurus, e-commerce marketing experts, and others will gain new jobs."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=449","Dec 6, 2021 12:47 PM","neonstrife","7. Health Monitoring
We’ll see more patient monitoring.
The capacity to monitor a patient without them needing to visit the office. Reducing expenses. Increasing the quality of treatment.
This is already happening. It is expanding with its potential.
8. Telemedicine
The usage of IoT in the health industry is noteworthy. It allows medical providers to provide remote treatment.
Now it’s conceivable to operate on patients or check their health from afar.
In a sense, the application of IoT in medical services has changed the industry.
9. Inventory Control
IoT can help retailers better manage their inventory.
In e-commerce or traditional retail business, storing and monitoring items is a costly process.
IoT devices may detect low stock and immediately purchase replacements.
This saves time, space, and money.
This reduces the customer’s bill without affecting earnings.
10. Eldercare
IoT can be used to help the elderly and anyone who needs help, in my opinion.
IoT devices can help them keep track of their food and other needs, preventing shortages.
People who cannot care for themselves can use such gadgets to check their security and health."

Edge computing refers to the concept of bringing computing services closer to service consumers or data sources. Fueled by emerging use cases like IoT, AR/VR, robotics, machine learning, and telco network functions that require service provisioning closer to users, edge computing helps solve the key challenges of bandwidth, latency, resiliency, and data sovereignty. Edge computing moves some portion of the storage and computes resources out of the central data centre and closer to the source of the data itself. Rather than transmitting raw data to a central data centre for processing and analysis, that work is instead performed where the data is generated — whether that’s a retail store, a factory floor, a sprawling utility or across a smart city.
Edge computing is all a matter of location. In traditional enterprise computing, data is produced at a client endpoint, such as a user’s computer. That data is moved across a WAN such as the internet, through the corporate LAN, where the data is stored and worked upon by an enterprise application. Results of that work are then conveyed back to the client endpoint. This remains a proven and time-tested approach to client-server computing for most typical business applications."

Ten years ago, Industry 4.0 was just a theory. Now it's coming to life with real-life examples and best practices for projects.
Industry (or Manufacturing) 4.0 started as a German government initiative in 2011. It refers to a Fourth Industrial Revolution characterized by smart factories using robotics, autonomous operations, the Internet of Things , big data, analytics, artificial intelligence, and a convergence of IT and OT. The goal is to create efficient, agile and intelligent manufacturing.
There wasn't a prescriptive Industry 4.0 methodology for manufacturers to follow, so early adopters tried various approaches to see which worked best. Now, 10 years
later, we have reached an inflection point where Manufacturing 4.0 best practices are emerging, and big data, IoT, AI and automation are all playing critical roles.
""We focus on the capabilities that [Manufacturing 4.0] technology can deliver for our clients,"" said Stephen Laaper, principal and smart factory leader at Deloitte. ""From this perspective, there are really four technology capabilities that are repeatedly identified across our research and implementation experience.""
According to Laaper, where companies are focusing their Industry 4.0 efforts are in:
Factory asset intelligence and performance management.
Factory synchronization and dynamic scheduling.
Quality sensing and detection.
Engineering collaboration and the digital twin.
All of these initiatives involve big data, automation, AI and IoT. These technologies must also be integrated with existing corporate systems.
Complex integrations, and the need for robust security on edge networks and appliances, are likely two of the reasons 80% of respondents in a 2020 Deloitte-MAPI survey of 1,000 manufacturing leaders that Laaper cited said they were employing at least one of these four manufacturing initiatives, yet less than 40% had managed to fully operationalize their deployment.
'""They're struggling to scale,"" Laaper said. This scaling involves the expansion of big data capture and analysis, the real-time data capture of IoT and the implementation of critical intelligence and machine automation. In every business case where IoT, analytics, AI and big data are deployed, the integration and business process designs are different.
From Laaper's and Deloitte's experience, the companies that are most successful in deploying big data, AI, IoT and analytics technologies at scale in Industry 4.0 initiatives are those that focus on addressing a specific business problem. In this way, they don't set their sights too broadly. ""They then determine how that technology will fit into their existing technology stacks and how they can scale from pilot to full deployment,"" Laaper said.
There is also work to be done on the people side.
""There must be engagement with stakeholders who will be affected by the deployment, from the factory floor to the management office,"" Laaper said. ""In this way, you proactively engage people who will be affected by the deployment.""
Once the technology is implemented, resources are deployed to ensure that changes to newly created business processes are sustained and that any newly created data is accurate, useful and (most importantly) used.
Laaper explained how one company transformed its manufacturing by using these approaches. ""We partnered with our client, a high-profile manufacturer for the Aerospace industry with an 80-year-old factory,"" Laaper said. ""They were experiencing poor worker and asset efficiency, excessive inventory and inadequate constraint resolution. They were also using manual tools to manage production and needed help to architect and implement significant factory modernization.""
To modernize its manufacturing, the company implemented a proprietary factory synchronization and dynamic scheduling solution to optimize human and constraint planning. The solution employed RFID (radio frequency identification) to track inventory and integrate technology across the company's solution providers. Deloitte's role was to provide deployment and change management support for factory-floor teams.
After the project was implemented, the company found that it:
Increased throughput 12%, by improving asset utilization.
Reduced work in process (WIP) by 15%, by effectively managing constraints.
Saved $11.6M in labor costs by optimizing direct- and support-labor efficiency."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=450","Dec 7, 2021 8:54 AM","neonstrife","The company chose a very specific area of manufacturing to focus on; it only implemented the IoT, AI, analytics and automation technologies it needed; it engaged employee and management stakeholders in the project upfront; and it defined targets for results and achieved them.
""The most successful [Industry 4.0] transformations, regardless of the technologies deployed, transform their employee capabilities in alignment with the introduction of new technology,"" Laaper said. ""Start with strategy and a clear definition for the value you're seeking to create. Engage experts with the capability and experience to architect a solution that encompasses multiple technology vendors and the change management needed on your factory floor. Then, pilot and iterate to establish value before scaling."""

IoT: Introduction And Disruption Of Supply Chain Management
With commerce getting more intelligent, the supply chain industry is expected to grow increasingly dependent on IoT, offering to adopt a data-driven approach as required by businesses today
Technology has always remained the most prominent disrupting force across sectors, and the supply chain industry has been no exception. Technology is rapidly disrupting the supply chain industry across levels, from last-mile delivery to providing sustainability solutions to automated processes and tailor-made software at warehouses.
In today's world, where almost every sector is struggling to recover from COVID-19, India is emerging as a hotbed for opportunities for the Internet-of-things (IoT) which is set to soar to roughly $15 billion by 2021, as per the Zinnov report. The Increased penetration of affordable devices, combined with the power of cloud computing, analytics, and rising consumer expectations, is laying out the path for the rapid growth of the IoT market. With commerce getting more intelligent, the supply chain industry is expected to grow increasingly dependent on IoT, offering to adopt a data-driven approach as required by businesses today.
Simply put, IoT refers to a network of connected devices, objects, and sensors that accumulates data and communicates information. Applying IoT concepts to the supply chain environment has led to the rise of Industry 4.0, epitomizing innovative processes and smart services, aiding the industry transition towards an increasingly decentralized and self-regulated model. As businesses pivot from response to recovery post-COVID-19, end-to-end visibility has become imperative. Combatting this requires prescriptive analytics backed by real-time data from across physical fronts to avoid expensive disruptions, and IoT satisfies this need by faithfully refurbishing the entire supply chain environment.
The research report by HERE Technologies suggests that around 56 per cent of logistics companies are already using map-based solutions with real-time location data for shipment monitoring. IoT has started gaining momentum in fleet management, with 11 per cent of logistic companies currently using it. In the next two years, 38 per cent of companies are expected to channel more investments into IoT, while 29 per cent and 10 per cent show high interest in warehouse automation and electric vehicles, respectively.
IoT gathers multiple data elements such as the temperature inside containers, pressure, humidity, and other factors that could potentially compromise the product's integrity to trigger automatic condition adjustments. Real-time information gathered across IoT devices offers decision-makers a crystal-clear picture of everything: right from customer orders to individual items moving through the supply chain. This helps in optimizing the overall operating cost. IoT thus not only facilitates the tracking and monitoring of goods but also increases the precision of planning and brings more transparency to the communication process, thereby instituting a value creation approach in the sector."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=451","Dec 8, 2021 10:00 AM","neonstrife","With environmental sensors in place, organizations can now monitor storage conditions and track shipments in real-time whilst swiftly responding to incongruity and divergences. Global brands such as Amazon, Volvo, Nissan are pushing their frontier by placing IoT in their supply chain ecosystem. Shipping and logistics services giants like Maersk are piloting a Remote container management system that monitors the temperature and humidity in shipping containers, whereby an alarm is triggered if set limits are breached. This helps in reducing food spoilage and resource wastage while ensuring the quality of goods. The platform thus enables operators to monitor environmental conditions and improve the precision of transportation planning and implementation.
Besides movement, IoT also facilitates tracking the speed and the traffic flow, thereby enhancing how goods will move through the supply chain. This enables manufacturers, suppliers and distribution centres to map and plan shipments effectively to reduce handling time while ensuring efficient processing of materials.
IoT is today empowering organizations by offering them enhanced visibility into disruptions and calling for their attention early on in time. The case is not just true for the big players but also for the small and mid-scale organizations. With quicker detection of changing conditions, organizations can pivot faster decisions, improving business continuity. Additionally, with access to real-time information about every phase of operation, organizations can now see and respond to disruptions well in time."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=451","Dec 8, 2021 10:00 AM","neonstrife","Way forward
The idea of specialized and integrated AI-driven supply chains and logistics could be new to India; however, they are being rapidly adopted by new-age e-logistics players on a large scale, especially by the small industries. The reason - it is what business rationale counsels as the logical way forward.
With technology stored and deployed in the cloud, real-time tracking becomes more accessible and faster for all stakeholders connected to the modern-day supply chain and logistics ecosystem. IoT provides much deeper insights into individual processes, thus offering decision-makers a holistic 360-degree view of the business.
Like any digital transformation effort, the future of supply chain management is not at the mercy of any single technology but rather an amalgamation of capabilities to realize specific business goals. Digital disruption has already made in-roads into the industry in the form of digital freight forwarding, with traditional approaches now being gradually shunned. Therefore, if one is eyeing to address and solve specific business challenges, the optimized and most efficient solution will probably encompass the integration of technologies - IoT, real-time data streams, enterprise planning engines, AI, and advanced analytics."

IoT devices are everywhere. From smart locks and alarms to cameras that can be accessed remotely to allow us to view our pets from afar—not to mention the advent of delivery drones and smart cars, global requirement for the latest ‘thing’ has never been greater.
With this penchant for tech advancement comes one particular issue: that of data generation and how to transmit and store it. (Read also: IoT Security Challenges: Why Enterprise Must Assess Them Now)
While personal needs represent a proportion of this, by far the largest demand is driven by companies incorporating IoT devices into their business models and processes."

IoT-generated data takes up a lot of bandwidth. Be under no illusion - the term ‘a lot’ represents an eye-watering amount that historical storage solutions were never designed to cope with. The burgeoning increase in information presents a logistical challenge, as the whole basis of IoT requires instant data transfer. Centralized storage was never created with this in mind, meaning that a monumental shift is poised to take place in order to cope with demand.
Enter the micro data center (MDC)… In conjunction with edge computing, the world is waking up to the solution that will not only satisfy the increasing data storage and transfer needs, but offers a plethora of environmental benefits as well. (Read also: Edge Computing: The Next Phase of IT.)
So, let’s first talk about the logistics - namely, bandwidth and latency. This means the amount of data that needs to be transferred and the speed at which it happens. Latency refers to the delay of the movement of data. As you can imagine, the more data that has to move from place to place, the slower it becomes.
While this is typically measured in milliseconds, which might not seem a lot, even this tiny break in transmission could have catastrophic repercussions on, say, a drone flight or the reaction of a driverless car.
The current, most commonly used model of centralized cloud storage requires data to travel thousands of miles to be processed. Edge computing - and with it the use of localized micro data centres - means that this data can remain right by the source of data generation. This allows for instant analysis and immediate reaction to whatever information is produced.
For example, say a child steps out in front of a self-driving vehicle. This is recognized in real time, with no delay, and the brakes are applied. Even the slightest interruption could represent an unhappy outcome, something that edge computing is designed to overcome completely.
This is an extreme example but demonstrates the need for a dedicated solution to allow for new, automated workflows to satisfy the demand of IoT growth."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=451","Dec 9, 2021 10:11 AM","neonstrife","The Many Advantages of Micro Data Centres
MDCs are already being factored into multiple large corporation business models. Traditional bandwidth limits and performance have been further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as stay-at-home demand for streaming services has increased exponentially. As 5G infrastructure becomes a reality, so too will the further use of MDCs. (Read also: 5 Benefits of Hyperconverged Systems.)
Data stored at source, or at ‘the edge’, can be sorted into subsections and only that which needs to be transferred to a centralized data centre will travel further. The rest will remain safely stored, with the ability for companies to upscale extra space as needed, simply by adding additional units.
Utilizing micro data centres brings multiple benefits to companies. These include:
Reducing or removing latency for data analysis.
Scalability for company needs. Easily add an MDC as data storage requirements increase.
Removing the need for costly data storage rooms. Not only do these take up valuable real estate, but they require continuous and expensive cooling for efficient and safe operation.
Quick to implement. MDCs can typically be installed in a matter of weeks, as opposed to the years of planning that a traditional server room takes to put in place.
Cost efficient and green. MDCs cost up to 60% less to run than a traditional server room. Not only does this drive down running costs, it also demonstrates business commitment to their environmental responsibilities.
Quiet and compact. With a single MDC being the size of a refrigerator and offering virtually silent operation, even the smallest of enterprises can house them on their premises."

The innovation that is the micro data center has been many years in the making. With proven technology that’s been successfully implemented in some of the world’s harshest environments, the benefits are now being realized by business in more conventional locations.
From the smallest start-up that requires a single unit placed within the normal working area to corporate giants, such as Google and Microsoft, MDCs are being integrated into every element of business."

Basis and justification of determining the issue price of the Rights Shares
The issue price of the Rights Shares shall be determined and announced by the Board at a later date (before the announcement of the Entitlement Date) after taking into consideration, amongst others, the following:-
(i) the funding requirements of the Group as set out in Section 3 of this Circular;
(ii) the TEAP of the Shares based on the 5-day VWAP of the Shares up to and including the last trading day prior to the price-fixing date.
The Board intends to fix the issue price of the Rights Shares such that the issue price is at a discount of between 5% and 25% to the TEAP of the Shares.
This discount range was determined by the Board after taking into consideration the need of the Company to price the Rights Shares at an issue price deemed sufficiently attractive to encourage subscription of the Rights Shares and to enable the Group to raise the necessary funds required for the intended utilisation as set out in Section 3 of this Circular.
The illustrative issue price of RM0.12 per Rights Share represents a discount of 8.54% to the TEAP of the Shares of RM0.1312, calculated based on the 5-day VWAP of the Shares up to and including the LPD of RM0.1424; and
(iii) the rationale for the Proposed Rights Issue, as set out in Section 4 of this Circular.

KUALA LUMPUR: Sunway Pyramid has introduced Malaysia's first Internet of Toilets (IoT) system for a seamless user experience.
This is part of the mall's move towards digitalisatio. The first initiative was the Sunway Smart Parking for cashless and ticketless system in its parking area as well as an integrated Customer Engagement Hub to address customer needs wherever they are.
Sunway Pyramid's partnership with Singapore's Rigel Technology allows the smart toilet system to optimise commercial toilet performance with the IoT system via data collection.
With the previous maintenance system, supervisors often have trouble with cleaning performance, faulty equipment, and breakdowns as well as ineffective communication with the technicians that cause users' underwhelming experience.
""Our venture into the IoT system complements this concept that encompasses a holistic vision, going beyond just being environmentally friendly.
""Another aspect is in elevating experiences for our customers, which translates to providing excellent facilities and high-performance facility management. That's what we aim to achieve with IoT,"" he said.
The new technology will manage the toilet's performance via sensors and monitors attached to consumables such as soap, paper holders, paper towel dispensers and waste receptacles, main water fittings comprising taps, urinals lavatories, and push valves, as well as environmental monitoring such as air quality, temperature humidity, people counter and interactive feedback pane
Furthermore, the ammonia sensors will timely detect ammonia to prevent foul smells.
The data will be transmitted to a cloud service that can be managed and tracked through a web platform and mobile smart app.
Now, the management team will get to monitor the washroom performance, water consumption, and other data that detect anomalies and faults, which can be addressed to reduce downtime, lower cost and reduce water consumption.
It also optimises maximum workforce productivity, notifying the cleaners of urgent attention in terms of cleanliness, replenishing materials, and instant work allocation.
""We recognise the need to constantly innovate to meet the demands of our customers. From Sunway Smart Parking to Customer Engagement Hub and Sunway eMalls, our journey in digitalisation, innovation, and technology has just begun,"" said Chin."

Two days after, I studied the company's financial statement for 9 months in conjunction with its cash flow, to my astonishment, during this period, the company has purchased properties (RM78,057,000) and acquisition of subsidiaries (RM15,916,000), total amount paid is RM93,973,000. I do not have any issues on these purchases and acquisition. However, I don't see any good reasons for the company to paid a very high GOOD WILL (INTANGIBLE ASSET) OF RM33,883,000 for the purchases and acquisition. this resulting the company runs out of fund, now the company comes back to shareholders asking for money through proposed right issues. Profit for the period is RM33,702,000. and good will paid is RM33,883,000.
In the balance sheet, under non current assets, it appears that Intangible assets shoot up to RM115,877,000, good will to RM23,327,000. These 2 figures have no tangible asset value, they are fictitious figures which just help to balance up the accounts that's all. I regret to pay so much to buy this counter, the company has made good profit, by right, the board should declare dividend and pay to shareholder for their loyal support, instead, company comes back to you asking for money by issuance of RI. in the event that proposed right issues is passed in the coming EGM, frankly speaking, I am not capable to subscribe for the RI but to dispose it of again in the market with sore-hearted. Happy trading to those who are still in the market. The above is my personal opinion on the company's 3rd quarterly report."

Better to stay away from stocks with rights issue fund raising exercise.
Many cases of stock price falling below rights issue price after listing of rights shares. In some cases, price was below rights price before listing.
Investors are getting smarter not to contribute easy money to directors fund raising exercises to increase company fund.
Directors should be good in increasing company fund from higher business profits that will benefit shareholders.

How IoT Drives Digitization
The internet of things (IoT) is emerging as the flagbearer of businesses’ quest for digital rejuvenation. With its ability to harness data, the all-important fuel driving modern business, IoT is now seen as the glue that binds human ingenuity and machine intelligence.
But the adoption of sensors and other data collection mechanisms is also creating a story of haves and have-nots. Businesses that implemented IoT showed greater resilience during the pandemic than those that bided time. These IoT leaders also fare better on virtually every performance parameter than laggards. Combined with machine intelligence, IoT allows leaders to turn big data into smart decisions.
However, leaders and laggards alike need to be mindful of the impact of pervasive IoT on the employees. Process augmentation can affect employee buy-in, elevating human skills necessary for extending business modernization in the coming years."

The strategy is to entice u to get trap in their share mah!
Even if the stock that has huge undervaluation and Cash Rich like NETX with net cash more than its share price, it does not help loh!
Take for example for NETX....they bought up some of retail units in SG WANG Plaza for only token Rm 1................but after taking over the company.....NETX need to come up with millions & millions to settle the companies owing...b4 they can lay hands to any vacant retail lots mah!

Every year the Reuters NEXT conference brings together CEOs, founders, and other thought leaders from a wide range of industries to discuss what the year ahead holds. Last week, December 1-3, the IoT For All editorial team had the chance to digitally attend this conference. We were able to hear from speakers all over the world on the five selected topics for the year: “Policy for Progress”, “A Fairer World”, “A Sustainable World”, “Radical Redesign”, and “The Business of Growth”. Sessions covered a variety of industries, from finance to food to tech. Forecasts of growing digitalization mean that 2022 will bring more opportunities for IoT to develop new ways to improve the way we live and work.
Key Insights from Reuters NEXT for IoT in 2022
Commerce Will Continue to Move Online
While eCommerce has been gaining traction over the last several years, the consensus at NEXT is that the traction gained through COVID-19 will continue on after the pandemic. Speakers across all areas of commerce noted the same thing: eCommerce has grown over the pandemic.
This growth in eCommerce continues to bring a host of possibilities to IoT and AI. For example, improvements in modern chatbot technologies have allowed businesses to provide efficient, helpful service to their customers without interrupting their workday. Advancements in tracking technologies allow customers to track their packages in real-time, eliminating many of the issues that plagued the eCommerce industry of old. Today, Amazon even lets customers know exactly how many stops away their deliveries are.
Speakers at the conference are confident that the growth in eCommerce will continue, even after pandemic-driven lockdowns are over. eCommerce is a new normal that is here to stay."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=453","Dec 13, 2021 9:29 AM","neonstrife","Contactless Biometrics Are Gaining Traction, but Privacy and Security Remain Top Challenges
Biometrics using AI are a popular source for identification and authentication for devices both in consumer and industrial spaces. The pandemic has increased the demand for contactless technologies, as people are hesitant to touch surfaces. This makes fingerprinting a much less attractive means of authentication for device manufacturers.
According to Dr. Daehoon Kim, CEO of IriTech, and Toby Norman, CEO of Simprints, there was already interest in contactless biometrics such as iris scanners or facial recognition technology in more consumer-facing devices, but now it’s necessary. Price has historically been a challenge in implementing contactless biometrics. This challenge is becoming less of an obstacle, though.
A key challenge facing the large-scale adoption of biometrics is privacy. Tessie San Martin, CEO of FHI 360, noted Asian countries were more willing to participate in biometric identification, but countries such as the United States were hesitant. Concerns over government tracking using biometrics are prevalent for those who are reluctant.
Security is another key challenge for biometrics. While security may seem inherent in biometric technologies, concerns remained among panelists. Contactless biometric technologies may be particularly susceptible, in that if they are not developed well enough, someone could use images of someone’s face, iris, or fingerprints to falsely authenticate.
Changes in an individual’s biometrics could also lead to difficulties in authentication. Masks have temporarily hindered facial recognition, but permanent changes could happen to someone’s biometrics. Strokes, burns, or other major injuries could suddenly change an individual’s biometrics and lock them out of devices. These cases may seem rare, but they pose a major accessibility risk for those affected."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=453","Dec 13, 2021 9:29 AM","neonstrife","The Metaverse is an Unknown Future
The metaverse, a fully immersive virtual reality technology, has become ubiquitous in tech news since Facebook announced Meta. In the metaverse, an unlimited number of users can be online, interact with the virtual world as they do the physical world, and own digital assets. Yat Siu, co-founder and chairman of Animoca Brands, explained that the metaverse currently only makes sense for leisure and entertainment uses.
Benoit Pagotta, co-founder of RTKFT, does not believe that the fact that the metaverse is currently only being used for fun means that digital assets owned in the metaverse hold no value. Pagotta explained that metaverse assets, such as the NFT sneakers RTKFT sells, hold the same value that physical high-end fashion holds; high-end items hold value because of the symbolic status that owning them provides.
Implementing business and commerce into the metaverse will likely become profitable, but the sensible use cases are not yet there. Technologies such as blockchain and NFTs will likely provide means for the metaverse to have practical applications in the future. How exactly the metaverse will impact the way we work and live our daily lives, though, is yet to be determined.
Conclusion
As has been the trend for the last several years, digitalization will continue to provide opportunities for IoT to solve real-world problems. The pandemic has expedited this process in a number of ways. We’re shopping more from home and relying on technology to provide us with service to rival in-person shopping experiences. There are some cases where the opportunities for IoT are still yet to be fully realized. Biometrics and the metaverse have current challenges that we are confident IoT and AI can solve in ways that have yet to be imagined."

Trends Shaping the Future of the Internet of Things (IoT)
The Internet of Things (IoT) market has been growing at an explosive rate in the past decade and will be valued at over $561.0 billion by 2022. IoT’s growth in the past few years can be attributed to several factors, including its convergence with mobile, cloud, Big Data, and other technologies to create even more opportunities.
Organizations that have already embraced IoT have seen it boost productivity and improve efficiency. But what lies ahead for IoT as we move into 2022? How can companies prepare to reap maximum value from their investment in IoT technology? To understand what trends lie ahead, let’s take a look at 10 key areas that represent major drivers in IoT’s growth.
Internet-connected devices
The number of internet-connected devices is projected to reach almost 55.7 billion by 2025. International Data Corporation (IDC) expects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.2% from 2020 through 2025. Additionally, Cisco forecasts 30 billion connected devices by 2023. Why such rapid adoption? Businesses recognize they can increase efficiency while reducing costs—and consumers have embraced technology that makes their lives easier.
On average, consumers are interacting with a device every few minutes—and sometimes multiple times per minute—to keep up with a fast-paced world where everything happens in real time. With so many interactions happening at such high speeds, traditional architectures can’t cope and edge computing systems have stepped in to fill in where needed.
IoT at the edge
Edge computing is a trend that has gained widespread adoption due to its ability to drive down costs and improve business agility. For businesses seeking to benefit from these advancements, edge computing will become a crucial part of their strategy moving forward. Edge computing works by deploying internet-connected devices at or near physical locations where they collect data.
This setup can lower latency by reducing or eliminating communication with central cloud-based services, which improves efficiency while also decreasing costs. By using edge computing as an effective way to handle all back-end processing in real time, every connected device on any network can send its data directly to local servers. It is expected that edge computing will play a big role in IoT going forward—and it’s already having an impact today."

Unlike other technologies, blockchain is immutable. Once data has been written to a blockchain, it can never be altered or deleted. This makes it an ideal candidate for IoT edge computing applications. As more and more businesses continue to realize that securing their edge device data is critical in protecting their intellectual property, they will begin to rely on blockchain as a means of ensuring tamper-proof security.

IoT supply chain
The industrial internet revolution has enabled a supply chain that is more efficient and flexible than ever before. IoT devices provide companies with information on inventory, demand, and production in real time, allowing them to avoid bottlenecks in shipping or warehousing costs and streamline their distribution network. The result? Higher profits for businesses and a better shopping experience for consumers.
This helps e-commerce reach new heights, though brick-and-mortar stores are adapting as well—businesses will roll out more smart shelves in 2022. The global Smart Shelves market size is expected to grow from USD 1.8 billion in 2020 to USD 7.1 billion by 2026, at a CAGR of 25.1% during the forecast period—making brick-and-mortar just as competitive as online retailing while lowering costs.
AI and IoT
Smart devices and machines are on track to become an integral part of our daily lives. Thanks to technological developments in areas such as Big Data, artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud computing, smart devices can now analyze large volumes of data quickly. The massive amounts of data gathered will then be used to make decisions with little or no human intervention, thus greatly enhancing efficiency and leading to a significant drop in cost. This is how AI-powered IoT devices will gradually become ubiquitous—in homes, offices, hospitals, and so on."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=453","Dec 14, 2021 10:59 AM","neonstrife","Voice user interface becoming a reality with IoT
Voice user interface (VUI) is fast becoming a reality in IoT, as AI and natural language processing (NLP) continue to make advances in fields like machine learning. Deep neural networks and speech-to-text technology are improving fast with more and more research in AI and NLP happening every day.
Businesses that deal with field service will benefit from using VUI applications since they allow their customers to get things done at their convenience instead of having technicians come over all the time. In addition, it also gives maintenance and sales teams better communication channels to resolve customer queries faster.
IoT and smart cities
The IoT is revolutionizing cities as we know them. From smart power grids to smart parking, IoT is impacting several aspects of our lives. How cities are integrating with IoT continues to evolve, making them smarter and more efficient for all who live there.
As IoT continues to mature in cities worldwide, you can expect to see major changes in how big data analytics are used by city planners—both in terms of crime prevention and traffic optimization—to help keep everyone safe.
IoT in healthcare
As healthcare costs continue to rise, IoT has emerged as a key component in hospitals’ efforts to manage and decrease their expenditures. Healthcare IoT enables organizations to monitor their facilities and assets remotely, resulting in improved efficiency and better utilization of available staff."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=453","Dec 14, 2021 11:00 AM","neonstrife","IoT in education
From learners to teachers, educators can use IoT technologies to create seamless experiences from home and school. Online courses will be more interactive and engaging with IoT developments. With improved analytics, instructors can better serve their students and schools based on data-driven insights.
Another way that IoT will transform education in 2022 is through virtual reality (VR). As a tool for workplace training, VR will allow employees to explore new products before they hit shelves or instruct customers how to use new software tools right inside their office environment.
Work from home in IoT
Remote work is already widespread, but with IoT, it’s going to grow at an even faster rate. With all our devices connected and communicating autonomously, we won’t need to spend as much time in physical workplaces, which will shift them from a central gathering place for coworkers into more utility space. It’s estimated that 82% of U.S. employees want to work remotely at least once a week when the pandemic is over. The workplace is changing rapidly in many ways, and IoT is leading the way in transforming how we think about office buildings, meeting rooms, and workspaces as a whole.
IoT is Changing the Future
IDC forecast that global spending on IoT will nearly double to $1 trillion by 2022, with spending across all categories growing at a CAGR of 11.3%. What’s fueling such rapid growth? The answer is pretty simple: Businesses are starting to realize how much revenue-generating potential IoT has—and they want in.
As consumer demand for smart products continues to grow, so too will IoT adoption by businesses eager to meet customer demands with innovative products. As companies look towards smart solutions across their organizations, they are discovering that improvements are not only impacting internal operations but also have a direct impact on external consumer experiences as well. This is true of all industries, especially those where technology has traditionally been underutilized or non-existent."
