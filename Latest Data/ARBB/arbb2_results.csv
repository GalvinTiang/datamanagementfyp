There aren't two sides at work here (Pro-Beijing vs. Pro-West). There are three sides (U.S. vs PRC vs. HK Democrats). But the PRC and HK Democrats don't realize this; they're unaware they're playing 4D Chess against an adversary that can see 20 moves ahead. The Americans will denounce the new law in public while praying for the most severe of crackdowns in HK in private. They will secret just enough money and resources to the HK Opposition to provoke a response from Beijing, but never enough for the HK Opposition to pose any kind of serious threat.
Against an adversary of this scale, Xi is a schoolchild in a sandbox. He is an aging former pretty boy who is simply not educated or sophisticated enough to mount a competent resistance.

NO, it’s not death of one country, two systems; on the contrary 1C2S would emerge stronger with better protection for the majority of the HongKongers. The new law certainly spells death of foreign interference by countries that are brazenly involved in subversion and sabotage of China.
[2] Amnesty International also warned: “This attempt to bulldoze through repressive security regulations poses a quasi-existential threat to the rule of law in Hong Kong and is an ominous moment for human rights in the city.”
If human rights mean burning, looting, destruction and causing the city to go into a state of paralysis…
In London, Paris, New York police simply shoot the rioters. Amnesty International applies a different yardstick to China, and this organisation cannot be taken seriously. It is a stooge of the West."

There are plenty of reasons to champion for freedom and autonomy in HK; I also welcome that.

HK's freedoms have been under attack for years and now the demise of HK as an international financial centre is certain. This has tremendous ramifications for China's economy and FDI. CCP can intimidate its own citizens, and can continue to keep its capital account closed, preventing capital flight, but it can never become a global economic power until it has a fully convertible currency and open capital account, which it dare not do as it knows there would colossal capital flight offshore. It equally cannot force FDI or prevent global investors from reducing their exposure to HK and Mainland markets. To all those fervently patriotic young commentators here, does it not bother you that all the top CCP elites have much of their elicit gains secreted away offshore, with their children attending elite schools overseas, whilst the average Chinese citizen cannot remit more than $50k p.a ? Do you not appreciate that the Mainland elites have their billions sitting with international private banks, UBS, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan and the likes ? Do you pause to ponder why that is so, if they are CCP members and supposedly fiercely loyal to the Motherland ?

Police have arrested the executive secretary of the National Union of Workers in Hospital Support and Allied Services (NUWHSAS) M Saraswathy and four others this afternoon for protesting against employer Edgenta UEMS outside the Ipoh Hospital.
Holding up handmade placards, the protesters accused the company of “union busting” by threatening to take disciplinary action against certain staff active in union activities.
“Some of our members had been threatened they would be removed from their job if they continue to be active,” union executive secretary M. Sarasvathy told reporters.
Saravathy said the union was formed in 1997, but was dormant until 2016 when a new committee was elected.
She claimed harassment started in 2017 when the union asked to negotiate a collective agreement for workers with the company.
She claimed one of its members who worked in Seberang Jaya as a storekeeper was made to clean toilets after becoming the union’s branch chairman.
Members were also questioned for attending the recent May Day parade, added Sarasvathy.
“We want all this to stop as we are a recognised union,” she said, showing the media a copy of the recognition that was signed by Human Resources Minister M. Kulasegaran.
Union president K. Senthil Kumar claimed the company would force employees to take unpaid leave if they turn up late for work.
He also accused the company of favouritism by only allowing certain workers to claim overtime work.
Malay Mail is attempting to get Edgenta Mediserve for response to the union’s claims.
Edgenta Mediserve Sdn Bhd, a wellness support services company, is a wholly-owned unit of UEM Edgenta and provides hospital support and facility management services."

2) Company has the right to transfer any employee anywhere their branch is operating for the purpose of work expedience.
3) If there are any grievances the matter should be brought to the union and the union has to bring the management to the discussion failing which a complained should be lodged at the Industrial Relations office.

‘Electronic health certificate’ plan for cross-border commuters hit by poor storage, sharing of data
Government’s slow processes, use of faxes, have caused delays for Covid-19 patients, doctors say
Archaic IT systems and bureaucracy have hindered Hong Kong’s anti-pandemic drive and are slowing efforts to reopen its border with mainland China, public health insiders say.
The city has turned a corner in the crisis, with only a handful of local infections recorded in recent weeks. It has confirmed a total of 1,082 cases and four deaths.
But frontline doctors in the public and private sectors told the Post there have been problems developing an electronic health certificate for cross-border travellers and in sharing data across departments."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=203","Jun 3, 2020 11:43 AM","MoneyMachineMaker发发发","They worry that these hitches will also hinder the city’s ability to guard against a potential new wave of infections.
To safely reopen the border for businessmen, students and families living on both sides, Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Siu-chee said on May 2 that the government was exploring a mutually-recognised health system with Guangdong and Macau.
That involves using an electronic certificate to indicate the risk level of individuals based on their state of health, contact with Covid-19 patients and travel history.
The plan could allow such commuters to skip 14-day mandatory quarantine when they cross the border. However, a government source familiar with the situation said the plan had been delayed by Hong Kong’s outdated technology.
“Macau and Zhuhai have set up a similar system that is up and running, but there are concerns about privacy and IT security if we join them and pool our data,” the source said, adding that Hong Kong had been slow to implement a citywide digital system to store health information."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=203","Jun 3, 2020 11:44 AM","MoneyMachineMaker发发发","Dr Arisina Ma Chung-yee, president of the Hong Kong Public Doctors’ Association, pointed to the lack of an effective IT interface and ongoing challenges in sharing data efficiently between the Department of Health, which is responsible for contact tracing and confirming Covid-19 infections, and the Hospital Authority, which treats the patients in public hospitals.
“When a Covid-19 patient arrives at our door, we need to go into the part of the Department of Health’s system that we can access, and double-check the patient’s test report,” she said. “It can take half a day on a weekday, or a whole weekend if it is a Friday, before the information is recorded there.”
That could result in admission delays, as a patient must be kept in a separate room and could not be moved to an isolation ward with confirmed Covid-19 patients to avoid potential cross infections, Ma said.
Even discharging a recovered patient can be delayed, as all those who test negative twice for Covid-19 still need the Department of Health’s approval before being allowed to leave hospital.
Ma said: “We need to fax them the test reports, as their IT system is not compatible with ours and they cannot access the information online.”"

He blamed the poor data exchange between the various health bodies on obsolete systems and bureaucratic attitudes that went back decades.
For example, he said, the health department’s chest clinics could not retrieve tuberculosis patients’ medical history digitally even with the patients’ consent. “Everything has to be faxed or hand-delivered,” he added.

“The government’s IT system and mode of operation have been unfit for a long time. This epidemic has just exposed their weaknesses and the need for urgent reform,” said Yeung, a paediatrician in private practice.
He said many private practitioners hesitated to use the health department’s free Covid-19 testing scheme for their patients because of the inconvenience in obtaining test reports that were faxed over.
“Not all private doctors still have a fax machine in their clinics,” Yeung said.
Until recently, the department was sending faxes to some clinics indirectly through private laboratories, which in turn charged the doctors an administrative fee.
“The reason, I suspect, is that the government didn’t have our fax numbers in its database and was concerned about sending sensitive patient information to the wrong people,” he said."

The Hong Kong-born actor and director had just passed a white, female pedestrian in her early 30s at a safe distance when she barked at him to “F*** off back to China.” When Tse turned back in dismay and replied, “I’m British. How dare you?”, she yelled, “Take your f***ing virus home with you.”
For Tse, 55, who moved to England with his family at the age of six, the foul-mouthed outburst was a shocking wake-up call to a tide of racism unleashed by the coronavirus pandemic in his adopted country.
“The UK was incredibly racist when I grew up here in the 70s and 80s,” he recalls of his boyhood in the West Midlands town of Leominster. “We lived in a small market town and my parents ran a fish-and-chip shop and Chinese takeaway. Every Friday and Saturday night we used to get racist behaviour from drunken customers. They would come in to be served and at the same time abuse us."

“I remember thinking, ‘Why the hell did we ever leave Hong Kong?’ I grew up on Cheung Chau, part of a warm, loving, interconnected large community of family and friends. I had an idyllic childhood and then I arrived in this country that was cold, grey and unwelcoming.”
Tse came to believe Britain had grown more civilised and tolerant. He was the founding artistic director of the Yellow Earth Theatre, which showcases East Asian talent, and has directed productions at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Barbican."

All that seems to have changed with Covid-19.”
Tse’s experience is far from unique. In the first three months of 2020, police say there have been at least 267 recorded hate crimes against Chinese, East Asian and Southeast Asian people in Britain, compared with 375 in the whole of 2019. Thousands more are believed to have gone unreported."

The threat was most vividly illustrated in early March by a vicious attack on Singaporean student Jonathan Mok, who was left with a black eye, a broken bone below his eye and a swollen face after being attacked by a two teenagers in Oxford Street, just a few minutes’ walk from where Tse would later be verbally abused. Mok told police that as the teenagers attacked him, one shouted, “I don’t want your coronavirus in my country.”"

CARG – the Covid-19 Anti-Racism Group – has launched a petition calling on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to make a clear declaration that the British government “deplores racism and hate crimes arising from Covid-19 against British East Asian people and international students in our country”.
The group also issued a statement calling on the media, public figures and political leaders to emphasise “solidarity, courage and mutual support across all communities rather than feed hostility, division and racism”.
The depth of concern among Chinese and East Asian communities in Britain can be seen in the messages posted by people signing up to CARG. “I’m living in fear for my children and me because of the rising hate crimes,” wrote one. “I’m very worried about my future as a British Chinese living in the UK,” wrote another.
“We’ve had Brexit already so there’s a lot of racist anti-immigrant thinking in this country and now it’s being stoked further,” says Tse, a founding member of CARG. “It is a very dangerous time we are living in. Some Hong Kong students might want to think twice about coming here. I wouldn’t want Hongkongers and mainland Chinese to put their lives at risk.

At the root of the problem, Tse believes, is the fact that while Asian countries have handled the coronavirus effec­tively, Britain’s approach has been marred by “complacency, negligence and incompetence”. He says, “It shows the resi­dual colonialism, arrogance and the notion they knew better because they were more advanced and more civil­ised.
“They were looking down their noses and treating it as a foreign disease that could not possibly affect plucky little Britain. We had nine weeks to prepare and throughout that time I was aware of the severity of the outbreak because all my family and friends in Hong Kong were WhatsApping me on a daily basis.

“We have to stop this,” Leong says. “There must be no more of this prejudice. People have to speak with a strong voice against race crime, not just put their heads down and ignore it.”
He noticed attitudes to Asians in London had begun to change when he saw a woman stepping to one side and “staring me out” in a shop before the lockdown began. “It was like a comic scene at first,” he says. “Another time, a couple were walking their dog and saw me approach and literally dragged their dog aside to get it away from me – and this was before social distancing was introduced.”
Soon after, Leong’s 12-year-old daughter was shouted at by a woman in their local supermarket and Leong “went back to the shopkeeper who had seen it happen and I said it was really wrong and that you need to stand up to people who do these things”."

Now, people are thinking, ‘You look Chinese, you look East Asian, you must have Covid-19.’ That is absolutely wrong and we have to stamp this out.”
An early focus of CARG’s campaign were reports in the British press that they say racialised Covid-19 and created “a climate of fear, anger and hatred” towards British Chinese and East and Southeast Asian communities. References to the pandemic as “the Chinese virus” and attempts by the government to deflect criticism of its failure to prepare for the coronavirus’ arrival have triggered racist attacks and attitudes, the group claims.
British-born Chinese Pek-san Tan, who works as head of press at the London Chinatown Chinese Associ­ation and whose parents-in-law are from Hong Kong, is concerned about the potential long-term impact of “casual racism” on her children, aged five and three.
Before schools closed and the lockdown began, young children were playing games of coronavirus “it” in some primary school playgrounds and singling out Asian pupils, she says. “I had seen what was happening and I didn’t think young impressionable minds should be subjected to that because you don’t know what psychological effect it will have on them in the future.”"

Minutes later, as she spoke on her phone to the British Transport Police to report the incident outside the station, Tan was subjected to a second assault. “A well-dressed couple came towards me and the man walked right up to me and coughed in my face,” she says.
Tan says it is important to confront Sinophobia early to stop it spreading. “I know the Chinese com­mu­nity are having it really bad now but I look to other communities in the country – my Muslim friends or my black friends, who have a whole history of racism against them – and I think this is the poem And then they came for me.

More than 120,000 attended in the last academic year – a 30,000 increase on 2014-15 – but it is unclear how many will return in the autumn.
For now, at least, it appears racism is not their biggest worry, according to Tan, who has spoken to friends with children at British universities. “The way they see it is that racism is everywhere and their biggest concern is whether the UK health care system can sort itself out and people can learn to wear masks,” she says.
Whether the Covid-19 racism coursing through Britain outlives the pandemic or dies away with it remains to be seen. Whatever happens, walking away is not an option for Tse and many others for whom Britain has been home for decades.
“If I were to leave now and go back to Hong Kong, it would feel like running away from a problem that needs to be resolved,” he says.
Instead, when he found himself confronted by bigotry in Soho, he made sure that – unlike during his days behind the counter in his parents’ takeaway – he wasn’t going to let a racist have the last word. “When she had finished yelling at me, I said, ‘F*** your f***ing racism and your f***ing paranoia,’” he says. “She seemed quite shocked that a Chinese person was assertive enough to answer her in the same way she had spoken to me.”

While the probability remains very low that China will be treated like Russia or Iran, and US President Donald Trump has not mentioned sanctions against Hong Kong or Chinese financial institutions, the risk of a financial war – including being cut off from the US dollar system – is no longer “unthinkable” for China.
If Washington were to sever China’s corporate and financial system from the US dollar payments system, which is underpinned by infrastructure such as the Swift international payments messaging system and the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (Chips), it could start a financial tsunami that would lead global finance into unchartered territory, officials and analysts said.

Like virtually every other country in the world, China relies on the US dollar as a payment method for most international trade, financing and investment activities, with financial institutions in Hong Kong often playing a gateway role.
China’s use of the US dollar has helped America to maintain its currency’s “exorbitant privilege” – a phase used by former French finance minister Valéry Giscard d’Estaing in 1965 – in the international monetary system.
Beijing’s view of the US dollar is complicated. On the one hand, China’s government sits on the world’s largest stockpile of foreign reserves, over half of which is in dollar-denominated assets. Beijing also regards the US dollar as a kind of strategic asset, limiting the ability of Chinese citizens to exchange the yuan for the dollar to US$50,000 per year and keeping a wary eye on companies transferring dollars out of the country."

China’s former central bank governor proposed in 2009 that a new super sovereign currency should be created to replace the dollar.
China has encouraged the use of yuan in trade settlements, it has set up a market in Shanghai to trade yuan-denominated crude oil futures contracts, and it has developed a cross-border yuan payment system, signed dozens of bilateral yuan currency swap deals and even created its own multilateral bank.
These efforts, however, have achieved only limited success as the US dollar remains the first choice for traders, investors and central bankers around the world.
The yuan’s international use is limited compared to the dollar – the latest figure from the Swift system showed that the yuan accounts for just 1.66 per cent of international payment transactions versus the 43 per cent of the US dollar."

Because the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar and is freely convertible to other currencies, it serves as a means for China to access global capital.
Concerns are growing that the US may move to weaken or even break these links, depriving China of access to global funding while undermining Hong Kong’s status as an international financial centre and readily hurting the US dollar in the process.
The US has imposed financial sanctions upon a number of Chinese companies and banks before. Zhuhai Zhenhua, a state-owned oil company, was punished for breaking US sanctions against Iran, while Bank of Kunlun has also been cut off from the US payment system.

Dollar assets accounted for 58 per cent in China’s foreign exchange reserves at the end of 2014, down from 79 per cent in 2005, according to the latest data released by the Chinese State Administration of Foreign Exchange.
Cao Yuanzheng, a researcher at Bank of China International, said any US efforts to isolate China from the dollar payment system could accelerate the formation of a new international monetary order to replace the one that came into existence after World War II.
“We’ll see what new monetary system will emerge in the next 20 to 30 years,” Cao said."

Just look at the systematic exclusion of African-Americans in the US, who on paper have equal rights, but in practice, are treated as 3rd class people not worthy of the same respect and dignity as white people. Racism against non- white people In the West can be overt or subtle. You can easily call out the overt racism. The subtle racism is a sub-conscious and far more dangerous because the perpetrators have no self- awareness of what they’re doing and it is much harder to call it out or respond to it. So, while the U.K. thinks it is offering freedom to 3 million people in Hong Kong, what they are really offering is a chance to become a 2nd class minority resident resented by the natives and permanently exposed to bigotry and racism. That is not an offer for real freedom is it? Freedom in the West is not really what the white Western media wants you to believe it is - it’s only great if you are white."

I had Chinese friends when I went to college and never experienced any anti Chinese feeling. Despite the facts of the Korea War.
In malaysia I married a Chinese and had two children. On my returns to UK over the years I have noticed no racism towards my family, in laws and Chinese friends. That these disgusting things are happening now I can only put down to the change in the attitudes of the population which came with the massive immigration to UK, under the Blair and other governments, of people largely from the Sub Continent of India and the Middle East. These people often from cultures very different from the indigenous British did I understand receive some unwelcome from some of the population. But I venture to say these were not of a shocking nature. And all I can say is the events describe in the Article about David and poor girl from Singapore are a relatively new phenomenon and we must all monitor the situation and ensure that there are laws and Police to enforce them.

KUALA LUMPUR: Prestariang Bhdhas disposed its remaining 6.88% stake in OpenLearning Ltd (OLL) for A$1.92mil (RM5.52mil).
The company, in a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, said it plans to utilise its entire proceeds from the disposal within one month as rolling working capital to finance sales of the software & services business of the group.
Prestariang, in explaining its rationale for the disposal, said the group's immediate priority is to rebuild its financials following the cancelation of the SKIN project.
""As such the Group has had to adjust its priorities and embark on a business rationalisation which includes divestment of non-core assets to strengthen its liquidity position in the immediate term,"" it said."

China thinks strategically making moves that will give advantage in generations. In contrast the West don't believe in long term strategy other than their own Game theory - postulating that the system works best if all the players in this system pursue their own short-sighted interest in their moments.
This theory is the best engine winning short battles. But it is not working for long term projects lasting generations simply because there are not enough agents in the system interested in outcomes beyond 1 generation lifespan. Either Western politicians or Western businesses they don't invest into something that will pay off in next life. This is our weakness where China hits us. To be exact, we are being hit by ourselves because we now lag behind the other fast developing world . To me it is no longer a question if China can overcome the West. The bigger question now is if China can overcome China. China will not succeed in outer World without changing in it's very core. If China claims to poses ancient wisdom then they should understand (or remember at least) that what you are trying to change or to shape actually changes and shapes yourself"

The started deploying it a year ago . That makes me think that this ""leaked"" Chinese ""fear"" and this specific post were carefully designed to seed this idea in Trump's head, because China actually wants this button be pressed by Trump later, but with all the havoc that would come after this event China doesn't want to be responsible for it. By the time when when Trump will press this Swift button, China will be ready to push all its trade partners to switch to their own superior global digital system that is being launched right now. There would not be a better reason to do so than the fact that the SWIFT would be disconnected from China.
Ideally, China will be ready in 10 month for this scenario .
But now they are not sure that the president capable of falling into this trap will be re-elected. Trump might not be around when China needs him . So they started playing earlier ahead of schedule hoping Trump will push this button before he is gone. This message is designed to seed the idea and to give an impression of big fear if that would happen."

Have to admit that Canada's capabilities to test Covid fell behind third world african countries . The US spending enormous amount of money on healthcare as a portion of GDP or as absolute sum no matter how we look at this was not able to serve much smaller population - we simply were not able to produce as many ventilators as China did in much shorter terms. The fatality is higher in the US than in China not because China has hidden the severity but because US healthcare system is not scalable and ill prepared . Look at Germans - they have even lower mortality than China. Why? Are they hiding anything too? Should I mention quickly build data centers and systems with petabytes of data information flow in order to manage and track the spread of disease. Everything was built at once .

Malaysian has been ranked fourth in a global survey on public approval of their government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, ahead of Singapore and Indonesia tied in seventh position.
Chief executive officer of real estate agency IQI Global Group Kashif Ansari said it is no surprise that Malaysians feel their country has responded well to the coronavirus, because Malaysia has always had good world-class medical facilities and the government has taken muscular but empathetic action to protect the population.
""They have put health and well-being above short-term economic gains. As a result, Malaysia has had relatively few infections and looks like it will be able to emerge from the lockdown sooner than many other countries,"" he said in a statement today.
He said when property buyers from China and other parts of Asia looked around, they would see the United States and United Kingdom still having difficulties dealing with the coronavirus crisis.
Malaysia, he said, is about to emerge from its lockdown with remarkably little loss of life, pointing out that 105 other countries have had more Covid-19 deaths per million people than has Malaysia.
He said in the survey, Malaysia came in fourth with an index score of 58, behind the United Arab Emirates and India tied at third spot with an index score of 59. Vietnam was second with a score of 77, with China (85) topping the list, with the most citizens rating its performance favourably across all four key indicators: national political leadership, corporate leadership, community and media.
New Zealand (56) is the only Western country with an index score higher than the global average of 45 — indicating that citizens in Western countries are generally less satisfied with their countries’ performances.
Ansari said the survey was jointly conducted by Singapore’s leading social research agency Blackbox Research and international online panel specialist Toluna between April 3 and 19, 2020 on more than 12,000 people aged between 18 to 80 across 23 countries.
In addition, he said, in Southeast Asia, Malaysia looks like a safe haven from the coronavirus, noting that the welcoming visa policy, the diverse economy, the good educational opportunities, great medical infrastructure and the impressive response to the pandemic will make Malaysia more popular with foreign buyers in the second half of 2020 than in 2019.
“Mainland and Hong Kong Chinese buyers are the largest foreign buyer group in Malaysia. We also expect an increase in buyers from Singapore, Indonesia and Japan this year,"" he added."

Was there a fear that the probable high figures amongst the foreign community will tarnish the good numbers that were being achieved?
There was too much effort and attention in ""balik kampong"" issues and too little on the foreign workers.
Or is there a political angle? I.e to have good numbers to show the PN Govt is functioning.
I can only ask questions. People in charge will know better."

By Tsvetana Paraskova - Jun 05, 2020, 11:00 AM CDT
Join Our Community
WTI Crude prices may be set for a 90-percent jump to $70 a barrel by the fall as U.S. oil producers may have “over-cut” production, Dan Eberhart, chief executive of Canary Drilling Services, told Markets Insider this week.
According to the manager of the drilling firm, U.S. oil companies have curtailed production too much too fast when prices collapsed, setting the stage for a “mini-supply shock” on the U.S. oil market."

City’s trade with US is small, but some warn White House moves could reduce its importance as a financial centre
Markets shrug off White House address, but questions about export controls, trade tariffs and enhanced financial oversight loom large
United States President Donald Trump announced on Friday that he plans to begin stripping Hong Kong of its special trading status, but left many important questions about the city’s future as a financial and commercial hub unanswered.
The move will affect “the full range of agreements” the US has with Hong Kong “with few exceptions”, including its extradition treaty with the city and economic privileges enshrined in US law that differentiate it from mainland China, Trump said in the Rose Garden at the White House.
“We will take action to revoke Hong Kong’s preferential treatment as a separate customs and travel territory from the rest of China,” said Trump, indicating that the State Department’s travel advisory for the city would be updated “to reflect the increased danger of surveillance and punishment by the Chinese state security apparatus”.
The US would also take steps to sanction Chinese and Hong Kong officials “directly or indirectly involved in eroding Hong Kong’s autonomy”, he said, echoing the language of legislation enacted in November that requires a punitive response from the executive branch in such circumstances."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=212","Jun 9, 2020 9:59 AM","MoneyMachineMaker发发发","Hong Kong officials played down the impact of Trump’s vow “to revoke Hong Kong’s preferential treatment as a separate customs and travel territory from the rest of China”, noting the city’s direct trade with the US is only a very small part of its economy.
Trump did not set a timeline in his announcement , nor did he provide specific details as to which economic privileges would be removed, leaving uncertainty over what the US would actually do.
“This is definitely not positive, but we do not have the full details yet,” said John Marrett, a senior analyst covering Hong Kong at the Economist Intelligence Unit. “There were more details on other aspects such as visas and immigration. We will have to wait and see if his bark is worse than his bite.”"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=213","Jun 9, 2020 9:59 AM","MoneyMachineMaker发发发","With Hong Kong mainly serving as an entrepôt for the mainland Chinese market, direct trade in goods forms only a minor part of the economy. Its own manufactured goods could be subjected to US trade war tariffs, but the effect would be minimal.
Hong Kong’s government had anticipated “all the different scenarios” of Trump’s announcement, said Hong Kong Finance Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po, adding that revoking the city’s special treatment status would have little impact as the local economy was dominated by the services sector."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=213","Jun 9, 2020 9:59 AM","MoneyMachineMaker发发发","Questions also remain as to whether the US can avoid sanctions on the financial sector because of the negative impact it would have on American firms.
Nonetheless, the move will sharpen pre-existing anxieties about Hong Kong’s long-term viability as Asia’s premier business hub.
Potential controls on access to American tech goods may also damage China’s plan to use Hong Kong as an R&D and financial spoke of its Greater Bay Area blueprint for South China.
“The biggest consequence is that the US decision is accelerating both the demise of Hong Kong’s importance to China and the world, as well as the decline of China’s economy,” said Chen Zhiwu, director of the Asia Global Institute at Hong Kong University.
The removal of Hong Kong as a buffer between China and the West had put two “conflicting regimes” on a collision course, he said. “When this mitigating role is gone as Hong Kong becomes just another city of China, the clash will be 100 per cent direct and literally face-to-face, which is detrimental to China’s development and undermines its ability to rise, peacefully or otherwise.”"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=213","Jun 9, 2020 9:59 AM","MoneyMachineMaker发发发","Earlier in the week, sources close to the White House said that revoking Hong Kong’s status was the “nuclear option”, which was on the table but likely to be kept in reserve.
Taken to its full potential, Hong Kong will lose its special customs status, but remain a free port and World Trade Organisation member, meaning it will continue to trade on most-favoured-nation terms with the United States.
“The US’ move to discontinue the separate trade status is more significant in the context of US export controls than it is with broader trade in goods,” said William Marshall, an export controls specialist at law firm Tiang & Partners. “Hong Kong will be subject to those controls applicable to China, which would certainly negatively impact China's vision for Hong Kong as an R&D hub under the Greater Bay Area plan.”
The peg of Hong Kong’s currency with the US dollar, in place since 1983, is unlikely to be affected, as
the local government is sufficiently well armed with US dollars to support it.
“The peg is very unlikely to be in danger. In the short-term, we could see increased volatility in capital flows and the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate against the US dollar, especially if the US government were to take bolder action on Hong Kong’s special status,” said Louis Kuijs, Asia economist at Oxford Economics.
“It is possible to see the HK dollar-US dollar exchange rate to hit the weak side of the trading band as a consequence. However, we think that the peg with the US dollar is unlikely to succumb, given the sheer size of foreign exchange reserves, at US$441 billion in April, is twice the size of the monetary base,” he said."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=213","Jun 9, 2020 9:59 AM","MoneyMachineMaker发发发","Crucially, uncertainty regarding the city’s future as a global financial centre could “potentially jeopardise the ability of Chinese firms to access financing and purchase overseas deals” out of Hong Kong, said Carlos Casanova, Asia-Pacific analyst at insurance firm Coface.
About half of China’s total outbound investment flows through Hong Kong, with some of the world’s biggest deals over the past decade financed via the city, which also acts as the largest source of inbound investment to China.
Markets took Trump’s pronouncement in their stride. The Hong Kong dollar strengthened after the announcements, while the Hang Sang futures index was up 0.6 per cent on Saturday morning. Meanwhile, Chinese stocks listed in New York, including Alibaba (which owns the South China Morning Post), Baidu, and JD, all rose in Friday trading.
Tara Joseph, president of the American Chamber of Commerce Hong Kong, said that Trump’s announcement “did not mean US companies will be flipping a switch in Hong Kong and running for the exits”.
“There are many unanswered questions about how the US-Hong Kong special status could be unwound. The more clarity business receives, the more helpful it will be at this challenging juncture,” she said."

The best Trump decision made over the last three years, well done. I hope his decision would stop American products (eg. agriculture/seafood/fruit produces, electrical machinery, art and antiques, etc. etc.) selling to Hong Kong. This would definitely reduce Hong Kong trade deficit of $33.4 billion with US, Hurrah! HongKongers could save some more money for themselves or retiring their bank mortgages earlier.
Finally Trump should really mind his own business especially USA is ON FIRE over the week, for example, over 100,000 death of coronavirus, economy is still free fall, spreading conspiracy on Joe Scarborough in his tweets, Central Park racist incident, murder in Minnesota, Americans were outrage for Trump tweets threat that 'looting' will lead to 'shooting', inequality in USA, Twitter CEO finally told Trump his organisation will point out Trump’s Incorrect or Disputed Information, etc. etc. Any sensible responsible President/Prime Minister would fix up its own problems before minding other country’s own business. However Trump is consistently ignoring all American problems such as refusing to even acknowledge on the day when US coronavirus death reached 100,000, the seriousness of coronavirus earlier and kept playing down the coronavirus threat, but the best one must be advising Americans to inject disinfectant into their body to cure coronavirus, etc. etc."

However, private labs have yet to provide the numbers of tests they conducted for yesterday."

From the Covid-19 patients in ICU, one needs the help of a ventilator to breathe.
Noor Hisham attributed the absence of reported local transmission among Malaysians in the last 24 hours to the whole government and society approach.
He said the trend of new cases in recent days is consistent with the projection model by the National Health Institute.
""The Health Ministry would like to congratulate Malaysians on their cooperation with the government for this achievement,"" he said."

He also reminded Malaysians to wash their hands with soap, wear a face mask in public and heed warnings from the Health Ministry, referred to as the ""3Ws"".
The Health DG also announced that there were no new deaths and said that the country’s death toll stands at 117.
The single local transmission involved a foreigner, marking a milestone for the Health Ministry as for the first time, no Malaysian was infected locally since the start of the movement control order (MCO) on March 18.

High Court acquits Musa Aman, a senior figure in former PM Najib Razak's United Malays National Organisation.
Malaysian government prosecutors withdrew corruption charges on Tuesday against an ally of former prime minister Najib Razak, whose party returned to power in a new coalition three months ago after having lost the last election amid massive graft scandals.
The Kuala Lumpur High Court acquitted Musa Aman, a senior figure in Najib's United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) and former chief minister of Sabah state in Malaysian Borneo, after the prosecution dropped all 46 charges of alleged bribery in timber concession deals and money-laundering."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=216","Jun 10, 2020 10:53 AM","alipay88","Musa's lawyer, Amer Hamzah Arshad, said the charges had been akin to ""political persecution"".
The prosecution gave no reason for withdrawing the charges, which involved a total of 403 million ringgit ($94.60 million), and the opposition Pakatan Harapan coalition described the decision as ""confusing and disappointing"".
""The attorney general's chambers must immediately provide a full explanation for the decision as it would reflect on the true face of today's administration,"" it said in a statement.
Opposition leaders and critics fear political influence could sway the outcome of the cases against Najib and other politicians as the country's new Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin is dependent on UMNO's support.
Najib faces multiple corruption charges in three separate trials linked to the siphoning off of billions of dollars from state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) and other cases.
He has pleaded not guilty and will know the verdict in the first case against him in July.
Najib, Musa and others described the cases brought against them as politically motivated.
Outrage over the 1MDB scandal was one of the main factors why UMNO lost the historic 2018 election, its first defeat since Malaysia emerged from British colonial rule more than 60 years ago.
The victors' multi-ethnic coalition, headed by veteran leader Mahathir Mohamed, splintered in February, paving the way for Muhyiddin to patch up with UMNO to form a new, Malay-dominated coalition.
After the change in government, Najib told Reuters news agency he expected an atmosphere more conducive to a fair hearing. Last month, prosecutors dropped 1MDB-related charges against Najib's stepson, Hollywood producer Riza Aziz."

They choose to ignore plain facts of overt corruption and instead deflect to political parties such as DAP for all the money woes. What really stands out for me is that the 70% of Malays that support those above also have been conned into believing that DAP infiltrated and took over the Tabung Haj fund while PH were in power. This was activity promoted by my fellow Malays in UMNO and PAS. We are the root cause of our ills, no one else. Many Nons fully understand that there are straight up honest Malays throughout society. Unfortunately they are a minority. A sad indictment on the majority race.

Corruption is committed by those that do not truly believe in a higher power. They thought that they will never be punished because they possess the highest of power.
Corruption is not a natural occurrence nor is it normal. What you are implying is as though its part of life and we should accept it. If that is the case then perhaps there shouldn't be life.
Our job as part of mankind is to defend justice for those who are right and fight against those who are wrong. That is the reason why there are system and laws in every nation and organisation. Laws are meant to govern us so this sort of crime doesn't happen or happen less. It is anarchy if everyone do not follow the rule of law and commits crime that benefit them, without facing punishment.

You are right that it could be their upbringing that might have caused them to practice corruption, perhaps also peer pressure and competition in life. But I am not commenting about how and why a person turn to corruption. I am talking about why a person do not cease to commit corruption in the context of DoubleProsperitys comment. You should read and understand before commenting.
It is also not a load when I implied that these people who committed corruption, whatever their motivation or upbringing may be, do not believe in a higher power, be it in law or in god to punish them for their practices. Because if they do, they would be afraid to commit a crime. Imagine, if you know you are guaranteed going to be punished terribly, why still do it? You do it because in the back of your mind, you believe that there is nothing in the world that can punish you. I am not a theologian.

The government will no longer accept Rohingya refugees who enter the country illegally, and will instead deport them back to Bangladesh, said Malaysian Senior Minister (Security Cluster) Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob.
""The government hereby stresses that it no longer accepts these refugees and we are in discussion with the country involved to arrange for their deportation. The government will be more comfortable if the country can accept Rohingya refugees from Malaysia,” he said.
Speaking at the daily press conference today, Ismail said the government would also hold talks with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and Bangladeshi government, through the Foreign Ministry, for the refugees to be sent to a third country.
""Many countries are questioning how Malaysia managed the Rohingya issue and some even claimed that we are inhumane.
""So, we ask the Foreign Ministry to discuss with these third countries to take in these Rohingya refugees from Malaysia,” he said.
He said that if the third countries agreed to take in the refugees, then many issues, especially those involving illegal immigrants in the country, could be resolved.
Ismail Sabri said this when asked to comment on the 269 Rohingya refugees who were detained early Monday morning after entering the waters off Langkawi.
Malaysia does not recognise refugee status but has been a favoured destination for ethnic Rohingya, most of them Muslims, who fled a 2017 military-led crackdown in Myanmar, and more recently, squalid refugee camps in Bangladesh.
However, the South-East Asian nation has said it will no longer accept Rohingya refugees as it has tightened border controls to rein in the coronavirus."

KUALA LUMPUR, June 10 — Bukit Aman Criminal Investigations Department director Datuk Huzir Mohamed said today that the police will begin invoking the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 or Sosma against people-smuggling syndicates.
Huzir said this decision to use the law allowing detentions without trial was because previous offenders were found to have resumed their smuggling activities after they served their sentences.
“Looking at how previous punishments were not able to stop these syndicate members from resuming smuggling activities, we have decided to take sterner action by investigating the offenders under Sosma,” said Huzir during a press conference.
He was referring to previous offenders who were charged under the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act 2007 (Atipsom) and Prevention of Crime Act 1959 (Poca), served their sentences and resumed smuggling activities under a different syndicate name.
“The sentencing in three cases in Perak, Johor and Kedah previously did not seem effective, which saw the syndicate members continue to break the law.
“So now we have decided to enforce laws under Sosma and will investigate these syndicate members under organised crime laws,” he added.
Huzir cited a smuggling incident in Hutan Melintang, Perak in 2015 which took the lives of 60 Indonesians when a boat they were on sank.
The Indonesians were on their way back to their home country, he added.
He said the syndicate members were then part of the “Pak Yus” ring, which saw 17 arrested, two investigated under Section 26a of the Atipsom and nine more under Poca.
“But when they had served their sentences, police intelligence found that the syndicate members were still in operation and continued smuggling activities under a different syndicate name — ‘syndicate Halim’, where we recently managed to arrest 18 of their members and are tracing three more,” said Huzir.
He cited two more smuggling cases: one in Johor in 2016 and more recently on June 9 in Kedah. Both involved syndicates attempting to smuggle out migrants to their home country through boats via non-permitted channels.
“During the recent Covid-19 operations, the police arrested 40 syndicate members in Johor who were still conducting the smuggling activities,” he said.
He added that there were 65 people involved who will all be charged under Sosma for organised crimes. The particular legal section bars bail pending trial.
He said based on these cases, the police are of the opinion that past sentences are not effective deterrents in human smuggling, noting that it is a “very lucrative” trade.
According to Huzir, each of the migrant being smuggled are required to pay between RM1,200 and RM1,400, depending on the pick-up and drop-off points.
Referring to the June 9 landing in Langkawi, Kedah involving over 260 Rohingya, Huzir said police believe their boat to have been deliberately damaged when the smuggling syndicate lost contact with their ground contacts in Malaysia numbering 70.
“We believe they lost contact with 70 of the Rohingya in the country who act as agents were arrested during our recent operations,” he said, adding that 21 will be charged.
Huzir said police have launched three operations since January 1 in a bid to prevent illegal immigrants from entering the country, adding that some of them could even be harbouring the dreaded Covid-19 virus.
He said police stepped up their operations during the Hari Raya period, finding that illegal entry of migrant workers were usually heightened this time.
“Usually during Hari Raya, the migrant workers will return to their home country to celebrate Hari Raya.
“Based on information received, the migrants will return after Hari Raya to work in their respective sector previously,” he explained.
He said police acted quickly between June 4 and 7 to arrest the smuggling ring members, their captains and agents who are the ones to receive the illegal immigrants.
He also revealed that from three phases of operations, 135 cases are being investigated under the smuggling of migrant law and four cases under Sosma.
Syndicate members being investigated include Malaysians, Indonesians, Filipinos, Bangladeshis and Myanmar nationals.
“The police will also look into the possibilities in investigating the syndicates under the AMLA (Anti-Money Laundering Act 2001) to identify illegal possession of the syndicates.
“Under Section 4 of the Act, the police will confiscate properties owned by the syndicate members,” said Huzir."

KUALA LUMPUR: A total of 371 suspected members of several human trafficking syndicates were arrested by police in an operation from June 4 to June 7, according to Bukit Aman.
Criminal Investigations Department (CID) director Huzir Mohamed today said police would take tougher measures against them as some of the suspects had previously been involved in human trafficking and had not learned their lesson.
“We find that the law that was used was not effective enough. This is a lucrative business where they tend to get involved again, despite being punished,” he said at a press conference here.
The suspects are being detained under the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act (Sosma), which does not allow bail, and will be probed under Section 130V(1) of the Penal Code for being members of organised crime groups.
Huzir said the suspects comprised Malaysians, Indonesians, Filipinos, Bangladeshis and Myanmars, who were involved in syndicates in Penang, Perak, Selangor and Johor.
The individuals detained comprised those involved in the syndicate’s smuggling network, including boat skippers, transporters, smuggling agents and those in charge of preparing temporary housing for smuggled migrants.
Four investigation papers (IPs), involving 138 suspects, have been opened under “organised crime”, while five other IPs have been opened for “smuggling of migrants” (SOM), involving 285 syndicate members.
Bukit Aman is also considering probing the syndicates under the Anti-Money Laundering Act in order to identify the properties and earnings of the members of the group.
Huzir said this was the third phase in the police’s ongoing plan to eradicate human trafficking in Malaysia, with the first stage conducted before the movement control order (MCO) and the second from March 18 to June 3.
The first phase saw 52 suspects detained and the second phase, taking place during the MCO and conditional MCO, saw 124 suspects detained.
He said police were now moving into the fourth phase of the operation —identifying enforcement officers who were part of the human trafficking syndicates.
He said efforts under the third phase were strengthened over worries that some migrant workers who had left the country when the MCO first came into effect would be looking to come back in after Aidilfitri.
“This operation is in line with the directive given by the prime minister, who has instructed police and other enforcement agencies to tighten the country’s border controls to prevent the smuggling of migrants who might bring in the Covid-19 virus.
”We also note the health director-general’s statements that one of the criteria for the MCO to end is for our borders to be tightened to prevent any more imported cases,” he said."

Geneva - The International Air Transport Association (IATA) supports the wearing of face coverings for passengers and masks for crew while on board aircraft as a critical part of a layered approach to biosecurity to be implemented temporarily when people return to traveling by air. IATA does not support mandating social distancing measures that would leave ‘middle seats’ empty.
Evidence suggests that the risk of transmission on board aircraft is low. Mask-wearing by passengers and crew will reduce the already low risk, while avoiding the dramatic cost increases to air travel that onboard social distancing measures would bring.
“The safety of passengers and crew is paramount. The aviation industry is working with governments to re-start flying when this can be done safely. Evidence suggests that the risk of transmission on board aircraft is low. And we will take measures—such as the wearing of face coverings by passengers and masks by crew—to add extra layers of protection. We must arrive at a solution that gives passengers the confidence to fly and keeps the cost of flying affordable. One without the other will have no lasting benefit,” said Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO.
Measures to Reduce the already low risk of onboard transmission
IATA recommends mandatory face-coverings for passengers and masks for crew as one of several actions to reduce the already low risk of contracting COVID-19 on board aircraft.
In addition to face coverings, these layers of temporary biosecurity measures being proposed include:
Temperature screening of passengers, airport workers and travelers,
Boarding and deplaning processes that reduce contact with other passengers or crew,
Limiting movement within the cabin during flight,
More frequent and deeper cabin cleaning; and
Simplified catering procedures that lower crew movement and interaction with passengers.
When proven and available at scale, testing for COVID-19 or immunity passports could also be included as temporary biosecurity measures.
IATA does not recommend restricting the use of the ‘middle seat’ to create social distancing while onboard aircraft.
Evidence, although limited, suggests that, the risk of virus transmission on board aircraft is low even without special measures."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=221","Jun 12, 2020 9:24 AM","traderstrades","There are several plausible reasons why COVID-19, which is spread primarily by respiratory droplets, has not resulted in more on-board transmission, and is different from other modes of public transport:
Passengers face forward with limited face-to-face interactions
Seats provide a barrier to transmission forward to aft in the cabin
Air flow from ceiling to floor further reduces the potential for transmission forward or aft in the cabin, moreover, air flow rates are high and not conducive to droplet spread in the same way as in other indoor environments
High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters on modern aircraft clean cabin air to operating theatre quality, further assisted by high levels of fresh air circulation
Moreover, even if implemented keeping the ‘middle seat’ open will not provide the recommended separation for social distancing to be effective. Most authorities recommend 1m-2m while the average seat width is less than 50 cm.
“The cabin environment naturally makes transmission of viruses difficult for a variety of reasons. That helps explain why we have seen little evidence of onboard transmission. In the immediate term, our aim is to make the cabin environment even safer with effective measures so that passengers and crew can return to travel with confidence. Screening, face coverings and masks are among the many layers of measures that we are recommending. Leaving the middle seat empty, however, is not,” said de Juniac.
The long-term solutions for COVID-19 depend on medical science.
“We need a vaccine, an immunity passport or an effective COVID-19 test that can be administered at scale. Work on all of these is promising. But none will be realized before we will need to re-start the industry. That’s why we must be ready with a series of proven measures, the combination of which will reduce the already low risk of inflight transmission. And we must be careful not to hard-wire any solution so we can be quick in adopting more efficient measures as they will undoubtedly become available,” said de Juniac
Economic Impact
Calls for social distancing measures on aircraft would fundamentally shift the economics of aviation by slashing the maximum load factor to 62%. That is well below the average industry breakeven load factor of 77%.
With fewer seats to sell, unit costs would rise sharply. Compared to 2019, air fares would need to go up dramatically—between 43% and 54% depending on the region—just to break even.
“Airlines are fighting for their survival. Eliminating the middle seat will raise costs. If that can be offset that with higher fares, the era of affordable travel will come to an end. On the other hand, if airlines can’t recoup the costs in higher fares, airlines will go bust. Neither is a good option when the world will need strong connectivity to help kick-start the recovery from COVID-19’s economic devastation,”"

Looks like the MOH and Transport Ministry are both going on opposite extremes. Health DG says to avoid close conversation. Mr Wee says no need social distancing on flights. In airplanes ppl literally sit beside each other. No gaps in between unless ppl opt for business or first class. And the flight duration can be from an hour to many hours.
And then we have our NSC sending SMS yesterday stating “ Khas PDRM akan memantau pematuhan SOP premis perniagaan & kawasan awam sepanjang PKPP. Mereka yang ingkar akan dikenakan tindakan.“ Reminding the whole nation anybody who doesn’t follow the SOPs will face action by the police.
And we also have the MOE who has been alluding to the reopening of schools since CMCO, 4 May and that 14 days’ notice will be given. Preschools and daycares have moved well on and opened on 18 May - good for them. The toddlers and children in those age brackets are fine and healthy after nearly a month. Moving along at turtle speed, our MOE announced yesterday SPM, SVM, STPM & STAM on 24 June. The final years of secondary school only have the opportunity to return to school. No recovery plan announced yet on the younger students down to Primary 1.
The million dollar question is why aren’t students allowed to go back to school? Given there is no scientific data by WHO to prove that children are vulnerable- which probably explains why toddlers and preschoolers can enjoy themselves at daycare centres & preschools now. Can’t figure out how to implement school reopening perhaps? MOE is surely not stalling school reopening till such time the vaccine is found. Fact: Schoolgoing children have been to school for slightly over 2 months this year, after factoring the CNY break. MOE & Health DG need to publicly address the gaps caused by children missing out on academic learning and have been deprived of healthy social interaction with their teachers & peers, strain on teachers and parents for 3 months. Instead of pretending the issues are not there.
The govt shd be consistent in their policies."

This is a round-up of Covid-19 related matters in Malaysia and globally from June 6 up to 12.30pm today. In Malaysia, case numbers have exceeded 8,000 and globally, the virus has infected more than seven million people and caused over 400,000 deaths. More than 200 countries and territories are affected by the pandemic.
KUALA LUMPUR (June 12): New confirmed Covid-19 cases hovered around single and double digits from Saturday (June 6) till yesterday, with the lowest number since the enforcement of the Movement Control Order in March being two on Wednesday.
The daily new infections reported this week mainly involved non-Malaysians and imported cases.
Out of the 31 new cases reported over the 24-hour period up to noon yesterday, 11 were imported involving Malaysian students returning from Egypt while the remaining 20 were local transmissions comprising 19 non-citizens and a Malaysian.
Out of the 31 new cases reported over the 24-period up to noon yesterday, 11 were imported cases involving Malaysian students returning from Egypt and the remaining 20 were local transmissions comprising 19 non-citizens and a Malaysian.
At his daily press conference yesterday, Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said the 11 students were tested positive for Covid-19 after a second sample was taken from them.
He said between April 3 and June 11, a total of 566 Malaysian returnees from abroad were confirmed Covid-19 positive.
He also said that Malaysia will only declare itself Covid-19 free after recording zero infection for 28 days straight.
As of noon yesterday, the cumulative number of Covid-19 cases in Malaysia stood at 8,369. Fifty-one patients were discharged, bringing the total number of recovered cases to 7,065 or 84.4% of total cases. On Tuesday, 281 patients were discharged — the highest number of recoveries recorded in a single day.
The number of Covid-19 active cases now stood at 1,186. Only five patients are in intensive care units with none requiring ventilators. The death toll remained at 118 as no fatality was reported yesterday.
For the record, the nation recorded single-digit new cases over three days this week — seven on Monday, seven on Tuesday and two on Wednesday.
RECOVERY MOVEMENT CONTROL ORDER
In a special live televised address on June 7, Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin announced the Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO), which will replace the Conditional MCO (May 4-June 9).
Dr Noor Hisham has said that Malaysia has now entered the recovery phase and RMCO will allow the nation to prepare itself for the Covid-19 exit strategy.
Pointing out that the RMCO period will be a true test of the level of social responsibility and self-discipline among the people, he hoped it would succeed in breaking the chain of infection.
Most activities in the economic, social, education and religious sectors have been given the green light to resume fully under RMCO, subject to compliance with standard operating procedures (SOPs) set by the government.
Reiterating that the public should abide by the conditions set under RMCO, Dr Noor Hisham said people in high-risk categories such as babies, children, senior citizens and people with disabilities must be protected, and social distancing must be observed.
He said the RMCO will only be a success if all parties comply with the SOPs and if there is community involvement in observing the new normal as a way of life.
“We have to protect our own selves, our families, our community and our nation. If we don’t, who will,” he said.
Senior Minister (Security Cluster) Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob, meanwhile, told a press conference on Wednesday that the army will continue to help the police to conduct operations to monitor SOP-compliance.
Also involved in the operations are RELA members, the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency and local authorities.
As interstate travel is allowed under RMCO, their operations will shift from highway checks to monitoring business premises such as wet markets and night markets.
GLOBAL SCENARIO
World Health Organisation (WHO) director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a media briefing on June 8, said although Covid-19 transmissions are on a downward trend in Europe, he was worried about the situation in other parts of the world.
He said on June 7 alone, 136,000 new cases were reported worldwide with nearly 75% of them concentrated in 10 countries in the North American and South American continents.
Several countries in Africa are still experiencing a hike in Covid-19 cases and some have reported outbreaks in new geographical areas. A rise in cases has also been reported in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.
As for nations that have recorded declining infection rates and are on the verge of recovery, Dr Tedros said they should not take things easy as their populations can still be infected by the coronavirus."

COVID-19 BACKGROUND
According to the WHO website, its China country office was informed of cases of pneumonia that were detected in Wuhan on Dec 31, 2019. On Jan 7, the Chinese authorities confirmed that the novel coronavirus can be transmitted from human to human.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-COV).
A study of the virus’ genetic sequence suggested similarities to that seen in snakes and bats. China health officials identified the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan as the source of the transmission of the coronavirus.
On Feb 11, WHO announced the official name of the virus, Covid-19, which is an acronym for coronavirus 2019 — CO stands for corona, VI for virus and D for disease.
On Jan 30, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak as a global emergency. By then, it had spread to 18 countries and caused 170 deaths. On March 11, Covid-19 was declared a pandemic by WHO.
WHO has described the Covid-19 outbreak as 10 times more dangerous than the A H1N1 Influenza, also known as Swine Flu.
Swine Flu, which occurred between January 2009 and August 2010, infected more than 1.6 million people and caused 18,449 fatalities.
The International Monetary Fund has warned that the global economic recession caused by the Covid-19 pandemic will be worse than the Great Depression of the 1930s."

Also key data from WHO and other credible reviews have shown that children are the least risky category, have low Wuhan viral load which makes them unlikely to pass on the virus. So why are you punishing the children and parents (who still can’t concentrate on their work if their kids are home). You are still tooting your own horn and saying that it’s too early to reopen especially for the primary schools. But keeping them at home is putting them at more risk in losing out on important education
And let’s face reality - how many government school students can realistically continuous do any meaningful virtual/e-learning?
Also hypocritical is that the MOH has the cheek and gall to open day care centres but yet cute risk to school going children? If the risk is there wouldn’t it be more risky for the children in day care centres? So obviously there’s more going on behind the scenes - likely personal and selfish reasoning by the DG of MOH to look good in containing the outbreak. So please put your personal agendas to one side and look at the greater good which is for schools to be reopened quickly."

All three major U.S. stock indexes fell by more than five percent, recording their worst day in weeks.
It came as investors reacted to pandemic resurgence fears and digested dour economic forecasts from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The CBOE volatility index <.VIX>, a barometer of investor anxiety, posted its largest one-day point gain since March 16.
Here is how it looks:
- The Dow dropped 1,861.8 points or 6.9% to end at 25,128,
- The S&P 500 slid 188 points or 5.9% to 3,002.1.
- The Nasdaq closed 527.6 points lower or 5.2% at 9,492.7.
NEW YORK: Wall Street plummeted on Thursday as investors reacted to renewed fears of a pandemic resurgence and digested dour economic forecasts from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
All three major U.S. stock indexes lost well over 5%, posting their worst one-day percentage drops since March 16, when markets were sent into freefall by the abrupt economic lockdowns put in place to contain the pandemic. The Nasdaq snapped a three-day streak of record closing highs.
The sell-off was broad, with all 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 falling from nearly 4% to well over 9%.
""There's really no buy point,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""It's pretty much selling all the way through.""
Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York, agreed.
""Everything's for sale,"" Ghriskey added. ""There's fear we're near a top.""
Deaths of Americans from COVID-19 could reach 200,000 in September, a grim result of the United States' economic re-opening before getting growth of new cases down to a controllable level, according to a leading health expert.
At the conclusion of its two-day monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve released its first pandemic-era economic outlook, after which Chair Jerome Powell warned of a ""long road"" to recovery.
""The Fed keeping rates steady through 2022 could give investors the impression that the Fed may be more concerned about the pace of economic recovery than originally anticipated,"" said Joseph Sroka, chief investment officer at NovaPoint in Atlanta.
Economic data appeared to back up the Fed's gloomy economic projections, with jobless claims still more than double their peak during the Great Recession and continuing claims at an astoundingly high 20.9 million.
A year-on-year drop in core producer prices also reflected the central bank's disinflationary concerns."

Travel-related companies, among the hardest hit by mandated lockdowns, were sharply lower.
The S&P 1500 airlines index <.SPCOMAIR> tumbled 13.8%, while Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd dropped 16.5% and 14.3%, respectively.
Boeing Co was the heaviest weight on the Dow, shedding 16.4% after its top supplier Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc announced a 21-day layoff for staff doing production and support work for Boeing's 737 program.

Identity politics has turned inflammatory as Malaysia’s
former ruling party tries to claw back support.
When Malaysia’s Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition ruled the country, it faced an opposition that campaigned on a platform of anti-corruption, free and fair elections, and greater democracy.
BN, led by the United Malays National Organisation (Umno), the largest and most dominant party, ruled the country for 61 years until its shock defeat last year by the Pakatan Harapan coalition, with Mahathir Mohamad at the helm.
Now, for the first time in its history, Umno finds itself out of power and playing the role of the opposition. And in this “new Malaysia”, where once the opposition campaigned for reforms and clean governance on a pluralist platform, it has now been replaced by a previously moderate Umno turned ultra-Malay to court the Malay majority."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=223","Jun 15, 2020 9:43 AM","MoneyMachineMaker发发发","To further burnish its ethno-Malay credentials, Umno has teamed up with its one-time arch enemy, the Islamist Pan Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), to contest elections under the banner of Malay rights and Islam.
This month, thousands thronged Umno’s headquarters at the Putra World Trade Center in one of the largest crowds seen in recent years, to witness the signing of a charter to seal the Umno-PAS collaboration.
The change in the characteristic of Malaysia’s opposition from a plural platform to an ethno-religious one has transformed the country’s political landscape. Identity politics has become pronounced and inflammatory.
It has manifested itself in the calls for the boycott of non-Malay products, even halal products produced by non-Malays. It has also seen the proliferation of fake news involving race that has stirred anger and anxiety among segments of the Malay community suffering economic hardship.
Among this is false claims of mainland Chinese being indiscriminately granted citizenship in Malay-majority Malaysia, a story which went viral, causing Malays to feel they are losing out and that the country is about to be taken over by the Chinese."

A reverse image search revealed the photo was actually from a 2013 incident in Manila where a former Filipino police officer burned the Malaysian flag to protest against the then–Philippines President Benigno Aquino’s handling of the Sabah issue.
The veracity of the photo and its inflammatory implications were largely ignored even by the country’s political elite, with Umno’s secretary-general Annuar Musa tweeting out the photo from his official Twitter handle."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=223","Jun 15, 2020 9:43 AM","MoneyMachineMaker发发发","Malaysia’s identity politics has triggered a competition among political parties, non-government organisations, and political elites to be the biggest champion of Malay rights and special privileges, which are enshrined in the constitution and accepted and respected by all Malaysians.
It has triggered a race to be a defender of Islam, which is also enshrined in the constitution “as the religion of the Federation”, but other religions are allowed to be practiced in “peace and harmony”.
Malaysians of all races have long respected and accepted the sanctity of Islam, but the rising surge of identity politics has seen the opposition and opposition-linked NGOs accuse the Pakatan Harapan coalition of being anti-Islam in a bid to discredit the government. In government-owned mosques in several states, pro-opposition preachers have been telling their congregation that the government discriminates against Islam, wants to eliminate Islam, and is “liberal,” which is an anathema to conservative Muslims.
Politicians from the Chinese-based Democratic Action Party (DAP), a member of the ruling coalition, have been a particular target of such attacks, where the party is constantly accused of being anti-Islam and seeking to take over the country.
Hence controversial Indian Muslim preacher Zakir Naik, wanted in India on money-laundering charges, has become a cause célèbre for political elites, never mind the fact that he accused the country’s Hindus of being more loyal to India’s Narendra Modi than Malaysia’s Mahathir.
Naik also called Malaysian’s ethnic Chinese “old guests” who should leave the country before he does. Naik was granted permanent residency in Malaysia by the previous government.
In an illustration of the febrile political climate, Malaysia’s youngest minister, Syed Saddiq Abdul Rahman, who initially backed calls for the preacher to be deported, said “an attack against our Chinese and Indian brothers and sisters is an attack against all Malaysians,” but later changed his tune after suffering a huge backlash from Malay-Muslims. Days after his remarks, Syed Saddiq called on Malaysians to forgive Naik and to “move on"".
This focus on identity politics steals attention from where it should really be directed. It is crucial for the Pakatan Harapan government to fix the economy, a mammoth task given the huge debts it inherited, but it is possible if all members of the coalition parties sit down and work together with discipline and focus.
If the economy blooms, hatred and suspicion will dissipate.
Yet given the state of provocation, the disregard of political elites for the potential of racial riots, with some expressing “it will never happen” or others simply shrugging their shoulders, as if to say “who cares”, is mind-boggling.
In the event of the worst, everyone will suffer, as fire does not distinguish race or religion. There will be no winners, only the ashes of the power-hungry."

They the PRDM and the AG's chambers charged 2 people and when the case was fixed for hearing, the DPP promptly withdrew the charges. Thereafter it became a cold case file. THE POLIS and the new IGP never bothered to continue with the investigation. If they coud do this (reluctance to investigate further) to their very own TOP polis officer, do you think that they would bother about Pastor Koh and the others who dissappeared in the hands of the very infamous Special Branch ? It is 46 years since this brutal murder of a dedicated and loyal TOP Polis Officer took place and whom the then Prime Minister stated that the IGP was gunned down by ""ANTINATIONAL ELEMENTS"". It is pertinent to note that the then PM DID NOT SAY that the assailents were communists, gangsters etc although the PRDM were at pains to pin this murder also on the assailants of the Chief Police Officer of Perak. Although they were due to hang they asked for this murder to be tried...the rest is sandiwara. If the present bunch of SB officers were around then,with that Pichay fellow leading them, they would probably blame it on the LTTE !!!! The murder of the Mongolian lady has still not been solved !

And employers should be asked about their preferences of race when it comes to employment. It is a well known fact that Malay employers will prefer Malay employees and Chinese employers will prefer Chinese employees and Indian employers will prefer Indian employees. The problem is that there are relatively few Indian employers. And the big Indian employers like Ananthakrishnan and Tony Fernandez would be mad to employ only Indians. Their companies show a remarkable mix of Malaysians. Exactly what all Malaysian employees should do. As the writer points out the proportion of Indians in Malaysian prisons is far higher than their proportion of the population. And again more Indians die in custody than any other race. Indian poverty is inter-generational partly because of their exclusion from so many educational and employment opportunities in the country. The Government extends to Malays so many schemes and programs for their upliftment but offers very little to non Malays. It is time to change things."

The Malaysian Islamic Party’s Central Committee on Economic, Real Estate and Entrepreneur Development has predicted that the country’s GDP growth rate can reach 2.5-3 percent in 2020 despite the COVID-19 outbreak.
Malaysia's GDP growth rate may reach 2.5-3 percent in 2020
Although it is a drastic reduction of pre-pandemic forecasts and the lowest since 2009, the projection runs counter to several recent predictions that the Malaysian economy would actually shrink by up to 1.0 percent.
Vice Chairman of the committee Mazli Noor said that the 0.7 percent GDP growth registered in the first quarter is reflective of the country’s resilience in the context of the ongoing pandemic.
The relatively modest performance for the first quarter of 2020 is supported by the services and manufacturing sectors, which grew 3.1 percent and 1.5 percent respectively, with other sectors experiencing varying degrees of deficits.
He said that services, manufacturing and construction will play a major role in the nation’s growth. Supported by the government's Prihatin Economic Stimulus Package that was announced earlier, the committee is projecting a 5.0 percent to 5.5 percent growth in the services sector this year, with manufacturing coming in at around 3.0 percent and construction contributing an estimated 1.0 percent to the nation’s economic growth.
The recently announced conditional movement control order (CMCO), which allows for a more flexible and deliberate reopening of the economic sector, also provides much-needed room for economic activities to resume, he added.
The committee agrees with analyst projections of a full economic and value chain recovery by the second half of 2020, with the construction sector - particularly that involving government public infrastructures - being allowed to return to full speed."

What nonsense. These idiots have no grounding in reality. This is obvious the product of the local PAS no standard schools and equally someone who made it to an equally no standard university based on privileges derived from race and not merit.
I suppose it explains why PAS states are basket cases as are businesses run by PAS and the like. When they start a business with free money or cheap loans they project base on their wonderful business plans deluded profits they feel they can earn. Without even making a cent they spend beyond their means to renovate their homes, buy expensive furniture and the obligatory Mercedes or BMW. Let's not talk about luxury holiday shopping trips.
THEN THE MARKETS SPEAK, and the business fails (so many examples not worth writing) and the public needs to bail them out again. This is what is going to happen to our GLCs.

I guess these PAS fellows are basing their expert opinion from siting in a air con office and getting ""Ilham"" from the heavens on the Malaysian economic status. The private sector has been decimated by the covid 19 MCO as businesses have been ordered to close. Now that we are in the CMCO period where human traffic outdoors has increased but that is not being transmitted to people going out and making huge purchases for any and everything hence business seem to be sluggish. Once the CMCO is lifted and it is business back to normal, the full impact of the global and local economy meltdown will take effect. The talk around town in the private sector is based on two issues 1) Retrenchment 2) Survival. I am not sure if Mazli Noor is getting his global economic outlook from reading harakah or from day dreaming of a Malaysian Utopid under PAS leadership but coming back to reality; the global supply chain has been disrupted and broken hence worsening and deepening the the global recession. So if Mazli Noor thinks manufacturing and construction will lift the Malaysian economy; then my question to him 1) Malaysian purchasing power is in doldrums hence who will be buying locally manufactured stuff. Even if there are buyers for our locally manufactured stuff internationally (mind you the whole world is in economic crisis) the global supply chain is dead in the water hence how are we going to get our manufactured stuff out to the buyers 2) Construction - so who are the main players in construction. Construction companies are going to have a tough sale ahead once their projects are ready.. Who do construction companies hire? Malaysians ? If Mazli Noor has ventured out of his air con office and into the city; the benefactors of the construction boom (or bust) are the foreign workers. I guess when PAS & PN's optimistic economic outlook become a grim reality and the Malay people start losing their jobs & income and clamor to their ""Malay First"" gov't for financial aid and help which the PN gov't will not be able to help as there is no money in the nations coffers and also the UMNO & PAS politicians piranhas need to be feed first and foremost; I guess PAS has to blame their trusted boogymen - DAP & the Chinese."

The government has introduced numerous measures to benefit individuals as part of the RM35 billion Economic Recovery Plan named PENJANA in short, that was announced by Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin today.
There is the introduction of a tax exemption of up to RM3,000 for fees paid by parents to nurseries for child care — up from RM2,000 previously — and RM800 eVouchers for the use of childcare services that are booked online, to be used from now till end-August.
These initiatives will be facilitated by the Ministry of Community and Women Development, together with the Inland Revenue Board.
To enable remote working and education under the new norm, Muhyiddin also announced 1GB of free internet for all users from 8am to 6pm every day, to surf educational web pages and to use video conferences applications, up until Dec 31, 2020.
""Besides that, all users will be able to access for free, without limit, government web pages and the government's Covid-19 application, in particular mySejahtera,"" Muhyiddin said when delivering his speech on PENJANA.
For e-wallet users
The government is also crediting RM50 into each e-wallet, matched by RM50 cash-back or discounts by e-wallet operators, to benefit 15 million Malaysians aged above 18, with annual income below RM100,000.
For single moms and the disabled
Meanwhile, the government is planning a one-off payment of RM300 to be given to 300,000 single moms and disabled listed under the Department of Social Welfare before Hari Raya Aidiladha.
For gig-economy workers
The government, which is in the midst of crafting a policy to support the growth of the gig economy and the welfare of those in this sector, is also allocating RM50 million in the form of matching grant for gig economy platforms to allocate social security contribution of up to RM162, and Employee Providend Fund contribution of up to RM250 per employee, per year.
Limitless public transport rides on RM30 per month
Separately, it will introduce a RM30 monthly public transport pass (Programme MY30) to be used for limitless rides on all public transportation under the purview of Prasarana in the Klang Valley.
The programme is open to all Malaysians and will take effect from June 15 until end-2020.
Additional allocation for B40 PEKA
On the healthcare front, the government plans to allocate an additional RM50 million for the B40 PEKA Scheme, to fund screening tests and medical equipment.
The B40 PEKA Scheme is the Skim Peduli Kesihatan for the B40 group, a government initiative under the Ministry of Health that aims to sustain the healthcare needs of low the country's income groups by focusing on non-communicable diseases."

Under this model, buyback the distressed mortgages and then worked to refinance those mortgages by lowering monthly payments based on the current national income or adding more years to make affordable monthly payments to the level of current rental value. If the occupants still can’t pay the reduced rental, the HOLC take over the property at the current market rate, fix it up, and rented it out until another person buy it. Such an arrangement would avoid fire-sales during the downturn and using the public wealth to cover the banks’ losses as in the previous recessions.

Each time another seat falls the crowd erupts in spontaneous applause. In the crowds the old chants break out, the chants of the late 1990s and the movement for reform, Reformasi, that started with then Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sacking his Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim after Anwar challenged his authority and his handling of the Asian Financial Crisis. The Reformasi movement, which started with such hope and promise, ended in tear gas canisters fired on crowds and long jail sentences for Anwar and others involved in organising the protests.
‘Reformasi, Reformasi, Reformasi!’
Malaysia is a complex multiracial and multi-religious country. The Malays, who are constitutionally bound to be Muslim, make up just over half of the country’s population. Malaysians of Chinese origin make up over 20 percent of the population, with Indian Malaysians like Sham and her family and indigenous groups making up around 10 percent each. Along with neighbour Singapore, Malaysia’s large multiracial population sits in stark contrast to the more ethnically homogenous Thailand to the north, and the more religiously homogenous Indonesia to the south and west; politics, often divided along racial and religious lines, is thus particularly complicated. The constitution, written up by the British, dictates that the Prime Minister must be a Malay, and since independence in 1957 the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) had ruled as the dominant partner in coalition with smaller Chinese and Indian ethnically based parties.
Nobody seriously expected the populist wave sweeping authoritarians to power across the region, from Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines to Narendra Modi in India, to hit Malaysia.
But against the backdrop of the 1998 Kuala Lumpur Commonwealth Games, Anwar Ibrahim tried to turn the country’s racially divided politics on its head. After being sacked as Deputy Prime Minister, he formed the People’s Justice Party (Parti Keadilan Rakyat or PKR) and invited activists and members of all races to join. When Anwar was sentenced to long prison terms for corruption and sodomy (charges he has always denied and maintained were politically motivated), PKR joined with other parties to form an opposition coalition, Pakatan Rakyat (Peoples Coalition), which made significant electoral gains in the 2008 and 2013 general elections, sending shockwaves through the mighty UMNO party apparatus. Despite also making gains at previous polls, on that night in May 2018 almost no one expected this coalition, now reorganised as Pakatan Harapan, to win, to take the capital and seize power at the election."

At 92 years old, Mahathir had come out of retirement to bring down his own successor, Najib Abdul Razak. Najib was mired in one of the biggest political corruption scandals the world had ever seen, with billions in state government funds missing and billions also ending up in his private bank accounts. Mahathir was back, he said, to ‘save Malaysia’ – back to right past wrongs and restore the country’s glory from before the corruption scandal had turned it into a global embarrassment.
Statesman Turned Populist Hero
Despite his past as an iron-fisted dictator, his prior willingness to sack judges he didn’t like, censor and control the press and order police to fire tear gas on and arrest protesters, this time Mahathir promised to be a democratic and conciliatory leader, bringing old enemies into his new coalition with the common cause of ousting UMNO and Najib. Some of them, like PKR Vice-President Tian Chua, were my dad’s old university friends who had spent time in prison simply for politically opposing Mahathir. Even Anwar, whose political feud with Mahathir had dominated Malaysian politics for almost two decades, met and shook hands with Mahathir in a Kuala Lumpur courtroom in September 2016. After the election, Anwar would quickly be granted a royal pardon and released from prison; as part of their coalition agreement the 92-year-old Mahathir would eventually hand over power to Anwar, who was given the title of ‘Prime Minister in waiting’."

Mahathir’s first 20 months in power was marked by disappointment, U-turns and backflips. A website called Harapan Tracker kept count of the government’s performance in following through on the promises laid out in their manifesto. After 685 days in office, of the 556 promises Pakatan had made to the country before the election, only 26 had been achieved. 122 were in progress and almost 400 hadn’t even been started on yet. For everyday Malaysians this marked a series of frustrations; they had voted for change, but still the cost of living continued to rise and wages stagnated. Much needed foreign investors, whom Mahathir had promised would come roaring back into the economy after the election, instead stood idle on the side lines watching to see whether economic reforms would really be carried out. In a series of closely watched by-elections, voters made their feelings heard, delivering Pakatan blow after blow and handing prized seats back to the regrouping UMNO under the leadership of Najib’s former deputy, Zahid Hamidi. A series of by-election defeats in late 2019 created a sense of despair among some in Mahathir’s government, who began ways to change the course of the administration.
Chinese Malaysians have long been the bogeyman of Malaysian politics – anxiety over Beijing’s influence often a cover for good old-fashioned racist dog-whistling. But Mahathir had ignored that and drawn in many members of the Democratic Action Party (DAP) into his cabinet, even appointing Lim Guan Eng, a top DAP politician to the powerful post of Minister of Finance. The predominantly Chinese political party (at times nicknamed the Developers Action Party for their pro-business policies) was an easy target for the now UMNO opposition who had teamed up with the conservative Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), to form a united front of Malay-Muslim parties trying to bring down Mahathir’s government."

There were two main figures leading the plot, one being Muhyiddin Yassin, Mahathir’s second in charge, the other being Azmin Ali, an ambitious politician from Anwar’s PKR party who had his own eyes on the top job and wasn’t afraid to undermine Anwar to get it. For months tensions between Azmin and Anwar has simmered just below boiling point and rumours of a party split had been flying. It all came to a head in February 2020 at the luxurious Sheraton Hotel.
Sheraton Move
For some reason, Malaysian politicians love to make their moves at 5-star hotels. In a series of events the Malaysian media has dubbed Langkah Sheraton, or the ‘Sheraton Move’, Azmin and Muhyiddin met with key leaders from UMNO and PAS at the Sheraton and hatched a plan to form a ‘backdoor government’. UMNO and PAS would join with Muhyiddin’s party along with a faction of Azmin’s supporters from PKR and together they would form a new Malay focused government, kicking out the Chinese dominated DAP and removing Anwar from his anointed post of Prime Minister in waiting. The initial plan was for Mahathir to remain leader of the government, but just switching the component parties which made up his administration.
Mahathir would later claim that he had no idea what his lieutenants were up to; that they had gone rogue. But by now Mahathir was 94, and allies of Anwar had begun pressuring for an exact handover date for when he would give power to Anwar. Mahathir was hesitant and repeatedly said he needed more time to get the country’s still recovering economy back on track. Perhaps Mahathir thought that the threat of a backdoor government and the threat of Anwar being side-lined would be powerful enough to keep Anwar and his allies off his back and give him space to breathe. Perhaps he thought Azmin and Muhyiddin were all hot air, and their plans would never materialise anyway? If so, it was a rare miscalculation for a man that made few political mistakes."

Far too many things happened to accurately summarise them all: the plotters moved to form a new government, but Mahathir refused to play ball with UMNO in particular, seeing as the party included Najib, who was now facing corruption charges in court. So, he quit as Prime Minister, hoping to be reappointed the next day as head of a new national unity government of all political parties not facing charges. But all the parties rebuffed Mahathir’s call for a national unity government, seeing it as a way for Mahathir to simply further entrench his own power and have each minister only beholden to him. In the end, Malaysia’s king appointed Muhyiddin Yassin as the country’s next Prime Minister, with his allies Azmin, UMNO and PAS in tow. UMNO, which had ruled the country for more than six decades was now the largest coalition partner in government again. Sure, Muhyiddin was leading the ship, but with a small number of MPs in the government from his party, he would be beholden to the old guard. The opposition’s control was a blip on the radar, a very brief 20 months, an aberration on the political landscape."

I first interviewed Mahathir for SBS World News in April 2017. My first impression of him was his wit and the speed at which he answered questions despite his old age. He was charming and had a way of drawing you in with his way of speaking and communicating. At the time he was playing the reluctant leader, the statesman who didn’t want to be prime minister but was drawn into battle to ‘save’ the country. It was easy to get caught up in the moment with him and his narratives, but in retrospect that reluctance was nothing more than a political strategy. The final question I asked was whether or not he, the man who had brought down every single one of his political rivals throughout his many decades in politics, had made a miscalculation, whether Najib would finally be the one politician who had got the better of him. He laughed at the question, but replied firmly: ‘No, Najib will not get the better of me.’
At the age of 92, the wry old man was able to keep his promise and get the better of Najib at the elections. But now he was 94 – perhaps he was fading, perhaps he had finally made a mistake by stepping down as Prime Minister instead of using the power of his office to control the situation. In the backroom shadows of the Sheraton Hotel, Muhyiddin had finally gotten the better of him.
Politics is a brutal game, and in Malaysia, where political leaders regularly find themselves in prison once they lose power, the stakes couldn’t be higher. Mahathir is vowing to fight on, vowing to bring a motion of no confidence against Muhyiddin in the parliament and oust him. But it looks like Muhyiddin has the numbers to hold on until the next election in 2023. By then, who knows if Mahathir will even be around to make another political comeback. He has said he still isn’t ready to retire, but there is a sense that the old man’s time has come and gone, that he had his comeback and he blew it. He had it all – the highest office in the land – but still he wanted more. He was unwilling or unable to set a date to stand down, he was unwilling or unable to let go his grip on power that he held like a sword for decades and that he came back from retirement to seize again."

Obviously, I was wrong on the specifics, but the fact remains that no one in Malaysian politics had the power to remove Mahathir but himself. And perhaps it’s more fitting of the man, that instead of being taken out by one of his enemies, he was taken out by himself. Blinded by hubris and ego, unable to even contemplate the idea of letting go of power, he took himself out of the doors of the office thinking the very institution itself couldn’t survive without him. Thinking that the politicians of all stripes would come begging to him to continue serving and that he would be back in the prime minister’s chair in a matter of hours. After dominating the country for so many decades he thought the country couldn’t live without him. But time moves forward, and slowly Malaysia will too."

This intention to allow UMNO members to cross over was never done for the betterment of Malaysia or PH coalition, but for his political interest only.

One, Mahathir is an experienced man and his advice will be useful. Two, Mahathir has a great appeal to the Malays. Three, Mahathir has some diehard supporters. Four, Mahathir could be a good leader at the Asia Pacific Economic Conference (Apec).
Besides naming Anwar as DPM, it might be a good idea to name a second DPM. This was done in Singapore. There is nothing wrong in doing so.

It is time for Mahathir to hand over the reins and look at how he can reclaim Bersatu and reform the party from within. If Bersatu is to remain a party in the Harapan coalition, it must do so without an agenda to swallow the others up.
PKR still has remnants of Azmin Ali loyalists and Anwar must purge his party of these individuals, or just like Mahathir, see his party implode slowly. PKR is the most promising multiracial party of all and it can lead Harapan through its strong message of pure reforms.
Shafie has an uphill battle ahead of him, now that Musa Aman is free and will do whatever it takes to reclaim Sabah. Musa is still beloved in Sabah and there are many who remain loyal to him. Shafie must now focus all his attention on ensuring that Sabah doesn’t fall into the hands of Umno again and continue to keep Sabah a reformed state.
Amanah also has a huge task ahead of them in its effort to push its agenda of moderation further into the PAS heartlands. Mat Sabu has shown tremendous potential in bringing the extreme and far-right towards the centre and this effort will prove the most important one of all in realising Malaysia’s dream of becoming a first-world nation.
The DAP must keep its momentum going by showcasing that it is truly a multiracial party – its leadership must press on a firm message of inclusivity. It cannot just become a party to replace the MCA or there won’t any difference between the two"

The new normal is money, position and power. And also, to attain it at any cost. Even to the extent if it destroys the nation.
That is why we need leaders with principles. We can only dream of a perfect leader. But a leader like Anwar who stood by his principles must be given that opportunity to prove his words and promises.
The time is now - or it might be too late to save this nation."

You start by talking up the Manifesto which was betrayed by the turncoats. Articulate point by point the reform process which will take place under Pakatan Harapan Plus WITHOUT Mahathir as PM. There must be a clear departure from the racist and bigoted modus operandi of Pakatan Harapan under Mahathir which caused its collapse. Why is Pakatan Harapan in Opposition still toying with the idea of a 'disaster' like Mahathir as PM?
Pakatan Harapan is either
1) as unprincipled as PN and sees politics as a 'game of thrones' where the ultimate objective is to grab power and not the fulfil the mandate and Manifesto which got them elected in the first place
2) or it is suffering from a collective Stockholm syndrome. The is a well describe phenomenon whereby the victims of abuse of torture, kidnapping etc feel dependent and even affection towards the perpetrator ( read Mahathir ) ! With Stockholm syndrome, is not easy to cure but it is possible by being 'rescued' from the abuser so that 'rehabilitation' can take place.
Forget about grabbing power through Mahathrist means i.e. political betrayals exemplified by Bersatu and turncoat PKR politicians, lying about the Manifesto thus cheating the Rakyat and betraying the government you are leading.
Pakatan Harapan must break away from the abuse of Mahathirism otherwise it will never be able to reform the country. It needs to outline a clear set of principles and stick to it under Opposition. There must be a united political philosophy which DEFINES Pakatan Harapan. Now is it only about about power, but power for what and for whom?"

68 MPs want Mahathir, 39 want Anwar.

Anwar has no further aces. He cannot get any other MPs to join. His 39 is maxed out, and is actually falling.

That is reality.
PN politicians do not fear or respect Anwar.
Many Malay voters do not support Anwar.
As for Mahathir, like him or loathe him, the fact is PN fears Mahathir and Malay voters respect Mahathir.
Anwar supporters expect Mahathir to fight PN, and then hand Anwar the rewards on a silver platter. Get real. Why would he?
Perhaps Anwar might be a better, more ethical PM candidate.

INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS
Diversification from timber business to ERP and IOT provides ARB with quantum leap in earnings
Company’s large pool of clientele consists of underserved SMEs as well as GLCs
Leveraging on unique partnership model to roll out IT software and platforms and to ensure customer stickiness
Cash-rich balance sheet further supported by on-going conversion of irredeemable convertible preference shares
We ascribe ARB with a fair value of RM0.51
Company background. ARB Bhd started off in the timber business. Subsequently, it diversified into the provision of IT services, especially in the field of enterprise resource planning (ERP) and internet of things (IOT) solutions.
Fruitful diversification. Subsequent to the diversification, ARB’s financial performance has improved tremendously. This is mainly attributable to the existing low adoption rate of Small and Medium Enterprise (SMEs) business digitalisation and Government-linked Companies in South East Asia. As seen in the company’s 2019 financial performance, both the revenue and earnings grew by more than five folds. Moving forward, we expect the earnings growth prospect to remain exciting.
Unique ERP business model. Moving away from the traditional ERP pricing model, ARB’s unique business proposition includes the setup of a joint venture (JV) company with its partner. Under this arrangement, ARB will provide the necessary investments required to set up the ERP platform while the partners need only to impart their business knowhow. Nonetheless, we understand that in the initial years both parties have agreed to plough back the entire profits for reinvestment purposes.
Strong cash position. In order to implement the ERP business model, having a healthy cash reserve is important. In this regard, ARB’s FY19 cash level has grown significantly to RM27.6m. This is achieved via the profit-making IT business as well as cash injection from its main shareholder through the conversion of ICPS. Thus, we do not expect any dividend payments in the foreseeable term as new cash generated will be reinvested for future expansion.
Business risk. We have identified three main risks associated with ARB’s key businesses. These include: (i) risks of new entrants; (ii) exposure to the industry the partner operates in and; (iii) risk of obsolescence.
Fair value. We value ARB at RM0.51, premised on pegging FY21F EPS of 11.9sen against forward PER of 4.3x. The premium multiple reflects the company’s high-yielding diversification strategy to the IT business from timber business previously."

KUALA LUMPUR, June 17 — The Perikatan Nasional (PN) administration must not take lightly the perceived democratic ""deficit"" following recent decisions by the prosecution to discontinue Riza Aziz and Tan Sri Musa Aman's court cases, Umno information chief Shahril Hamdan said.
In a recent interview with Malay Mail, Shahril acknowledges that the public backlash against the recent decisions has the potential to paint the PN administration, of which Umno is a part of, in a bad light.
""Notwithstanding the merits or mitigating factors of specific cases, for example the ICAC investigation with Musa Aman, I'm not under any illusion that on the face of it, it doesn't help our image vis-à-vis the perception of democratic deficit,’’ he said, referring to the Independent Commission Against Corruption of Hong Kong.
""There was a time Umno dismissed the same concerns as urbanite or liberal, as if those were pejoratives to be ignored in some grander scheme. I don't want the new setup of which Umno is a part to revert to that,’’ he said, referring to Umno’s position within the PN administration.
""Of course, as a matter of fairness, I also hope the public considers the specific circumstances of each case and with regard to charges being dropped, accord the same standards to curious decisions made during the PH administration too,'' he added.
This was a reference to the High Court in Penang, which acquitted former finance minister Lim Guan Eng and businesswoman Phang Li Koon’s corruption charges, over the purchase of a bungalow below the market value, while Lim was then Penang chief minister.
Former Sabah chief minister Musa was granted an acquittal by the High Court last week after the prosecution made a startling announcement that it was dropping all 46 charges due to various reasons, including its failure to obtain key banking documents and the unavailability of several witnesses, some whom have since died.
Musa’s lawyer, Amer Hamzah Arshad on June 9, had claimed that the corruption charges brought in November 2018 against the former Sabah chief minister was a form of political persecution, due to its timing and due to local and international corruption investigators having cleared Musa of wrongdoing in the past.
Amer cited the investigations by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission and ICAC between 2008 and 2011, which had cleared his client of wrongdoing. He had also argued that the funds mentioned in the 46 charges were political donations and not linked to any projects in Sabah or logging concessions.
In a statement released on June 9 as well, Attorney General Tan Sri Idrus Harun stated that his office had withdrawn the charges as the unavailability of documents from Hong Kong-based banks and some witnesses meant that proceeding with a trial would be untenable.
Both Amer Hamzah and Idrus had also cited former attorney general Tan Sri Abdul Gani Patail's past decision not to pursue the charges against Musa during his tenure."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=228","Jun 17, 2020 2:32 PM","MoneyMaker168","Meanwhile, Riza Shahriz Abdul Aziz, the stepson of former Umno president Datuk Seri Najib Razak was granted a discharge not amounting to an acquittal over his five counts of money-laundering some US$248 million (RM1.07 billion) alleged to have been siphoned from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) after he agreed to pay several million ringgit to the Malaysian government.
On the same day, the Prime Minister’s Office released a statement saying Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin was not involved with the controversial decision, insisting it was achieved by the prosecutors and the accused through the latter’s representation to the Attorney General’s Chambers.
Both court decisions were lambasted by Pakatan Harapan (PH), which said it would reflect negatively on the Muhyiddin administration, while Transparency International-Malaysia (TI-M) said this may reverse the country’s recent progress on the world Corruption Perception Index.
Yesterday, the High Court decided that former Felda chairman Tan Sri Mohd Isa Abdul Samad must defend himself on nine counts of corruption involving RM3 million.
However, the former Negri Sembilan mentri besar was acquitted and discharged of the sole criminal breach of trust charge against him as the court concluded that the prosecution had not shown adequate evidence to corroborate the case.
Speaking to Malay Mail, Shahril also warned that the PN government should not be embroiled in the perception that it is caught in a trend of a democratic “deficit”.
In order to achieve this, Shahril said it must maintain matters such as press freedom and press coverage for Opposition members, which he lauded as among the democratic reforms that were achieved under the Pakatan Harapan administration.
“To be fair to Pakatan, on balance, of course as an Umno person and as a Malaysian who has Umno persuasions, I think we would do a better job but there are certain things that Pakatan did that were laudable,” he suggested.
“I think the democratisation of space in society was real. I had tweeted before this that I had no problems to be invited on TV, I had no problems going into universities. These are things that in the past were not synonymous with Umno and I like that to change.”
In addition, Shahril also stated that the PN administration should table the Prihatin supplementary budget — consisting of the numerous stimulus package announced by Putrajaya to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus disease — in the coming parliamentary sitting to show its accountability.
Putrajaya previously said it would undertake an “unprecedented” move to amend existing Acts and introduce new Bills to better suit the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic currently faced by the country during the July sitting."

This appears to be extremely low for a technology sector stock (ARBB is now classified under Technology IT sector)
Currently there are about 713m PA which are not yet converted to the ordinary shares.
At conversion of 1PA + 19 cents to 1 mother share, it would add another RM135m of cash capital to the Company. The no. of ordinary shares would increase from 362m currently to 1075m if all PA were to be converted. This would increase the PE from 3.4 to 10.0 ( 3.3 x 1075/362 ) which is still low. If company profit grows, the prospective future PE would become lower. This implies that the current share price is probably under-value by the market.
A more reasonable PE of 15 to 20 can be expected. This means ARBB current share price have a potential to rise by a multiplying factor of 1.5 (15/10) to 2.0 (20/10)."

INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTSDiversification from timber business to ERP and IOT provides ARB with quantum leap in earningsCompany’s large pool of clientele consists of underserved SMEs as well as GLCsLeveraging on unique partnership model to roll out IT software and platforms and to ensure customer stickinessCash-rich balance sheet further supported by on-going conversion of irredeemable convertible preference sharesWe ascribe ARB with a fair value of RM0.51
Company background. ARB Bhd started off in the timber business. Subsequently, it diversified into the provision of IT services, especially in the field of enterprise resource planning (ERP) and internet of things (IOT) solutions.
Fruitful diversification. Subsequent to the diversification, ARB’s financial performance has improved tremendously. This is mainly attributable to the existing low adoption rate of Small and Medium Enterprise (SMEs) business digitalisation and Government-linked Companies in South East Asia. As seen in the company’s 2019 financial performance, both the revenue and earnings grew by more than five folds. Moving forward, we expect the earnings growth prospect to remain exciting.
Unique ERP business model. Moving away from the traditional ERP pricing model, ARB’s unique business proposition includes the setup of a joint venture (JV) company with its partner. Under this arrangement, ARB will provide the necessary investments required to set up the ERP platform while the partners need only to impart their business knowhow. Nonetheless, we understand that in the initial years both parties have agreed to plough back the entire profits for reinvestment purposes.
Strong cash position. In order to implement the ERP business model, having a healthy cash reserve is important. In this regard, ARB’s FY19 cash level has grown significantly to RM27.6m. This is achieved via the profit-making IT business as well as cash injection from its main shareholder through the conversion of ICPS. Thus, we do not expect any dividend payments in the foreseeable term as new cash generated will be reinvested for future expansion.
Business risk. We have identified three main risks associated with ARB’s key businesses. These include: (i) risks of new entrants; (ii) exposure to the industry the partner operates in and; (iii) risk of obsolescence.
Fair value. We value ARB at RM0.51, premised on pegging FY21F EPS of 11.9sen against forward PER of 4.3x. The premium multiple reflects the company’s high-yielding diversification strategy to the IT business from timber business previously."

Umno Youth chief Asyraf Wajdi Dusuki and Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Economy) Mustapa Mohamed have, in recent days, called for an end to the latest cycle of intense politicking. Asyraf and Mustapa, back in the cabinet, didn't, however, offer a means or instrument that will magically aid this whooshing. Another minister had earlier eased into the public domain the enduring idea of springing an anti-hopping law on levitating elected representatives. Soon after, the Lubuk Antu MP bolted from PKR, a party he swiftly embraced after winning the seat in May 2018 on a different ticket. No howling and hounding ensued. The nation has been glued to the mobile phone, rooting for, and also fearing, news on some stupendous crossovers. ""I am just preparing myself for another long political battle that will affect my business,"" a lady entrepreneur told this writer. Let's hear out another personality. Amanah strategic director Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad was the serving health minister when the silent enemy, Covid19, was about to terrorise normalcy and sent us retreating into our bunkers, homes that we so cherish."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=230","Jun 18, 2020 12:25 PM","WellingtonSky","In a reflective mode, Dzulkefly wrote that Pakatan Harapan personalities have been spared a merciless hounding had they stayed on as cabinet ministers throughout the Covid-19 lockdown. During Harapan's tenure, they were indeed pilloried as the polarisation machination was ramped up in tandem with the historic defeat of Umno-BN. In truth, the pattern of inflamed politics resembles not a mere cycle, it characterises an entire era. This may prove disconcerting to most Malaysians. Our democracy is evolving, maturing even, only excruciatingly so. Remember the 2005 unsheathing of a keris by a scion of Umno founding president Onn Jaafar? It was as if a confident Melayu Baru circa 1993, straddling the world, had retreated to shore up the ketuanan Melayu (Malay supremacy). This particular debate is harrowing. Ketuanan Melayu relates to Malay empowerment, about a race finding their footing after centuries of subjugation. It is a self-motivational theme aimed not at suppressing other Malaysians. Admittedly, the keris incident was a bad illustration of ketuanan Melayu, at a time when the national conversation was inspiring (or agitating) a rise in participants. Anyone with a view could spit them out as the comfort of anonymity was extended across the online sphere. The online din has not been entirely pointless. It has served as an ecosystem of watchdogs marshalling over the entire political terrain. One wrong move will trigger a leaked document from some government entity that is sure to go viral. The apprehensions over politics versus the economy aired by Asyraf and Mustapa, the musings of Dzulkefly, rumours of crossovers, and above all, polarisation, neatly fill a canvas that is shaped by the post-Covid19 challenge. This is the precise moment to attempt a major rethink. We have been assaulted on several fronts from health to politics to business. It is time to confront our troubles. One prognosis is fairly straightforward. The Malay political class during the triumphant Umno era cultivated strong support bases. Anyone with extensive grassroots support was always going to have a better chance at the much-anticipated party polls. These support bases saw themselves as professional, paid loyalists. While this is already changing somewhat, the old warlords are around still. So, the nation will have to step in to calmly address this. Fuelled by ambitions and money, bad politicians could always be dressed up with a fine sheen."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=230","Jun 18, 2020 12:25 PM","WellingtonSky","Take another quick example. The Electoral Reform Committee (ERC) will propose an institute to educate the millions of young voters who will now shape national politics. The ERC believes politicians should be similarly educated to be accountable. Will they ever listen? Will they not turn around and tell us they have a country to run, which is why opposing Members of Parliament (MPs) must be brought over to buttress stability? The current political impasse presents an opportunity. A swift return of Harapan with, say 120 or so MPs, will please and infuriate voluble segments in equal measure. By extension, this PN government should not endeavour to persuade rival MPs to take a leap of faith, for it will only deepen discord. Already in the coming years, key strategists will cringe as they look back at this dishing out of appointments to government-linked companies to earn legitimacy. To address multiple frailties at once, Malaysia needs a ""super"" government that draws the best talents from among serving MPs. Politicians are inherently networkers, built to assure and assuage. Disparate persuasions have given us a bigger talent pool of politicians. Many of the senior ones have worked with each other in the past. They must now huddle. There have been ideas about easing patronage and money politics, such as nurturing a class of professional party officials. Surely the government cannot be expected to fund party coffers. In the meantime, a few of the old certainties have vanished. To cite one example, the old pendulum that used to vacillate between Chinese support for MCA in one election and DAP in the subsequent political contest has come to halt. DAP has been the overriding choice in successive elections. We are now blessed, not tormented, by having a class of senior MPs who would be able to offer precious insights and perspectives. They are now kept apart in rival camps, cheered and jeered by feuding supporters. They should brainstorm collectively in a bipartisan manner, to produce urgent solutions. The world is watching. Young Malaysians will soon pose tough questions. In tandem with a bipartisan cabinet drawing the best talents from among serving MPs, the nation should similarly establish an effective reconciliation commission with an advisory role. This commission should look at events of the past five decades and peer into the future to fashion a formidable Malaysia."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=230","Jun 18, 2020 12:26 PM","WellingtonSky","Those millions of young voters who will dramatically ramp up the electorate from 14. 9 million to 22.5 million by 2023 don't share the misgivings and the perceived hurt inflicted on the older voters. This deluge of the young voters will reshape the political landscape of multiple constituencies. It is pointless to be looking at seat allocations at this juncture as nobody is properly acquainted with the thought process of the young. In fact, they haven't thought through their politics. Hopefully, this new political equation will render as unnecessary the usual race to land politically strategic cabinet posts such as the Land the Rural Development Ministry. KL/Selangor is the new heartlands where inhabitants relish the journey to the old heartlands to cast their vote. In any case, the electoral roll has never before witnessed such a spike. The very composition of political parties may actually change over the next few years. MPs looking to keep their seats should be dazzling a national audience. Admittedly, some cybertroopers and a number of the former MPs eyeing a quick return via snap polls will be among those bitterly resisting attempts at reconciliation and unity government ideas. The nation should not blink."

Gentle sir/madam, you have spoken with true privilege, a general disregard for policy & reform, and simply to assuage your own uncomfortableness.
Was this same uncomfortableness present when Najib's supporters slapped someone on live TV?
Was this same uncomfortableness present when Shahidan Kassim walked away without a trial, while being charged with molest?
Do you have any idea of the injustices ""one coalition"" has brought against Malaysian people?
Nothing is stopping these politicians from simply ""working together"". Nothing. Has there been some new law that government MPs are barred from meeting and organizing with opposition MPs?
FYI......
The actual, genuine improvements (that PH utterly failed to implement):
1) True reform of MACC, the police, the IPCMC, and whistleblower laws. With these in place, it will matter much less which political party is in power.
2) Decentralized power away from the Prime Minister. Look at all the hub-hub in PH. They're drunk for power: they want to be ""Najib but good this time"". You can see this arrogance in Mahathir's eyes every time he speaks: he literally wants to be Najib with a better reputation. Anwar still somewhat, but less. They are like dogs waiting to grab 80% of the meat, while ignoring that it seems quite unfair that one position should hold 80% of political power. This means open-elections for PM candidates, this means PM take a back seat and instead work WITH their top-tier cabinet instead of ORDERING their mediocre cabinet
3) An anti-hopping ban & redrawn EC boundaries.
Nothing is stopping a single MP from fighting for these reforms. Not a single thing. All 222 of them are spineless: some are spineless for the rakyat, some are spineless for themselves. In the end, without a spine, we will move nowhere fast.
Please, spare us your ""uncomfortableness"": please instead be uncomfortable with injustice, with inequality, with corruption, with abuse of power, with aristocrats and the wealthy.
Or else you are simply planting the seeds for PN, MN, BN, and the upcoming HN, CN, TN, and LN coalitions.
PH failed this test immediately. They should've learned from Obama: if you only fight for reforms with 10% of your political will, the rich & elite will notice your failures and claw back from the depths of hell, i.e., Trump.
Trump was literally elected right after Obama. Such a simple lesson, yet even ""internationally concerned Mahathir"" looks like a mediocre simpleton who has never reformed a government.

There is not one person in Malaysian politics with any level of leadership skills. That is because there is not one person with any vision beyond personal goals
As the song says “ If you don’t have a dream, how you gonna have a dream come true”
And Malaysian politics is totally devoid of any dream that includes the Malaysian people
No dream means nothing that party members can aspire to. Means no loyalty. Means chronic party hopping in the pursuit of self interest
Malaysian politics in its present format, regardless of how the idiots are arranged or in whichever way they coalesce are a bunch of useless idiots"

There are two ways in doing this. A scant and cosmetic fill-up of the NM quota, which unsurprisingly will be pale and stale faces from CA and MIC which the NM have rejected. As you had mentioned, the oscillation between MCA and DAP has ceased and one can understand why PAS and UMNO and now PPBM are dead against the DAP - it is not a party of ""yes"" men and that is why they want MCA and MIC. The NM saw this very clearly and obviously chucked them out. Except for Saravanan and Wee warming their seats the NM have nothing substantial to boast about.
Call it pessimistic but there is a better word for this - I am just being honest and realistic. There is no way a PN Malay Govt will consider the interests of the NM as the PH Govt had. It was not much but at least there was something. The funny thing is most of us had even made up our minds."

Ken Döscher had been looking forward to his first trip to Malaysia. The business student from Germany had always been captivated by the country’s pristine nature, beautiful beaches and exciting cosmopolitan vibe.
But when Döscher, 28, finally made his anticipated sojourn to Malaysia in early March this year, he never expected to stay way past his intended holiday period.
Like many travellers, Döscher is stranded abroad due to the worldwide travel bans and restrictions, which were implemented to curb the spread of the coronavirus. In Malaysia, the movement control order (MCO) was implemented on March 18.
“Before coming to Malaysia, I saw that there were only a few hundred cases here, so I was not worried at all, ” says Döscher.
However, the number of reported coronavirus cases significantly spiked, which subsequently led to Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin announcing the MCO on the evening of March 16.
“That was the first time I realised that I was going to be affected by the Covid-19 crisis, ” Döscher recalls."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=231","Jun 18, 2020 12:57 PM","ChinaDragon","Waiting it out
During the MCO period, Malaysian citizens and Permanent Residents are not allowed to travel abroad. The same kind of travel ban, however, is not imposed on international visitors who wish to return to their home country.
Although there are restrictions placed on the entry of all international visitors into the country, tourists and foreign nationals are allowed to leave.
Malaysia Airports Holding Berhad (MAHB), in a statement posted online, assures that all airports in the country continue to stay open during the MCO.
“Airports are categorised as an essential service, so all our airports will continue to operate, ” MAHB states, assuring that there are no restrictions on both international and domestic flight operations.
“Any decision to cancel flights will be at the discretion of the airline companies. Passengers are advised to check with the respective airline companies on your flight schedules.”"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=231","Jun 18, 2020 12:57 PM","ChinaDragon","Döscher, who is currently in Kuala Lumpur, will wait out the coronavirus situation here – or at least until the end of the MCO period.
“My plan is to stay here until the MCO is finished. There is no other country around South-East Asia which is open for tourists at the moment, so I can’t travel anywhere else.
“I like it here in Malaysia, because of the friendly people. Everyone speaks really good English, the food is also very good and the prices are not as high like in Singapore, for example.
Döscher, who was in Melaka before the MCO began, is glad that he managed to move to KL.
“There are more hotels and supermarkets here. I am happy to be in KL, ” he shares. In fact, Döscher has been documenting his holiday experience during the MCO through vlogs (video logs) posted on his YouTube channel, Ken Abroad.
Some of the videos show him heading out to buy groceries and other essentials at deserted shopping malls in the city. There are also posts which depict him sampling local delicacies, bought through take-away services, which he then tries alone in his room."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=231","Jun 18, 2020 12:57 PM","ChinaDragon","According to Döscher, who is a seasoned traveller, his trip to Malaysia during the health crisis has been an unprecedented experience abroad.
“The city looks like a ghost town. I have never seen a huge city like KL so empty. And in front of every supermarket, there are security guards to check your temperature. At some places, I had to write down my contact details every time I entered. That was a bit strange in the beginning, but I have gotten used to it already.
“I am still having a good time here; I try to make the best out of it. I can’t change the situation and it’s the same right now everywhere around the world, so I am not complaining about things I cannot change, ” he shares.
Too expensive to fly
Couple Steve Greig, 29, and Ivana Wibowo, 31, who were also holidaying in Malaysia when the MCO was implemented, have decided to do the same thing as Döscher – stay on and wait for the Covid-19 crisis in the country to settle down.
The Canadian couple has been travelling full time since January last year. They only started noticing how serious the Covid-19 situation was getting when countries began to close their borders.
“Now, some concerns are that we don’t know what our next move is. Flight ticket prices have doubled, everything is closed and not accessible, ” Greig and Wibowo offer in a joint email reply."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=231","Jun 18, 2020 12:57 PM","ChinaDragon","The couple has decided to stay put in Malaysia as it is too expensive to return to their home country in Canada. They are currently staying with a friend in KL.
“The average price to go back to Canada is between CAD$1,200 and CAD$2,000 (RM3,739 and RM6,232), compared to the normal CAD$600 and CAD$800 (RM1,870 and RM2,493).
“We can only get back home with multiple flight connections. There is a risk of being stranded somewhere else if connecting flights are cancelled.
“Besides, we feel safe here in Malaysia with the MCO taking place, ” they say in response to the decision to stay put.
Like Döscher, Greig and Wibowo have been posting videos of their holiday experience during the MCO period on their YouTube channel JetLag Warriors.
“We prefer to stay inside and be safe. Even though we miss travelling a lot, the MCO here is not too bad.
“Luckily we have a grocery store on the ground level of where we are. We are staying with our Malaysian friend so we have access to a kitchen which is awesome. He also happens to be a boxing coach, so we train with him every day.
“Our biggest challenge is staying connected as we find the data service quite slow in Malaysia, ” says the couple."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=231","Jun 18, 2020 12:57 PM","ChinaDragon","According to Greig and Wibowo, the coronavirus crisis has also greatly affected the budget for their long-term holiday.
“Our income comes from the travel and tourism industry. We have a YouTube channel that is all about travelling, and Ivana works remotely for a wellness company that runs retreats all over the world.
“So our finances are badly affected by the coronavirus. Luckily we have some savings we have put aside for emergency situations like this, ” they say.
The duo has been keeping their travel budget in check by cooking their own meals at home and avoiding ordering food from outside.
Finances aside, Greig and Wibowo are currently trying to get their visa extended so that they may plan their next move.
“We found very limited information about visa extension during or after MCO – on the process, what to bring, and even office hours, ” says the couple.
A quick check reveals that there’s a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section specifically on the MCO on the Immigration Department’s official website. However, some questions and responses are only available in Bahasa Malaysia.
The Immigration Department states that international visitors with expired or expiring passes during the MCO are allowed to return to their home countries.
Greig and Wibowo say the government should provide more information for stranded travellers.
“It would help us deal with the situation and plan our next move. And maybe (they would provide an) even longer grace period for expired visas since the immigration office would be busy and flights are still hard to get, ” they say."

When the MCO was announced, local travel operators only had a small window to prepare.
Malaysian Association of Tour and Travel Agents (MATTA) president Datuk Tan Kok Liang had then called the MCO “bold and decisive”, but criticised the lack of clarification for tourists caught in transition.
“Guests cannot be expected to proceed to the airport and catch the next flight home as easily as commuters taking a train home after work.
“Also, mechanisms must be in place to prevent or reduce unnecessary hardships to the rakyat as well as remaining tourists still holidaying in Malaysia, ” he says."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=231","Jun 18, 2020 12:58 PM","ChinaDragon","Since then, Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Nancy Shukri has clarified that tourists are welcomed to continue their stay in the country throughout the MCO, but they must follow the rules and restrictions placed by the authorities.
“Tourists are better off staying put where they are because it is safer that way. Once you go out elsewhere, you never know what the risks are out there, ” Nancy says, when contacted.
“You might be in contact with the virus or you might even spread it around. The best thing to do is just to stay in your room, ” she says, adding that sightseeing can only continue once it is safe to do so.
In addition to the cancellation of the Visit Malaysia 2020 (VM2020) campaign, all tourism facilities under the Tourism, Arts and Culture Ministry will be closed until the end of the month.
These include several popular tourist attractions in the Klang Valley, namely the National Art Gallery, National Library and Muzium Negara.
Döscher hopes that he will be able to visit some popular tourist attractions in the country once it is safe to do so. As a matter of fact, that is one of the reasons he is staying on.
“I would really love to explore and get to know KL and potentially more of the country when all of this is finished. But of course, that is not a priority for me at the moment. It is more important that everyone here stays healthy, ” he explains.
As for Greig and Wibowo, there’s no other place they would rather be during the Covid-19 crisis.
“We feel lucky that we are stranded here in KL and not somewhere else. We got everything we need here... groceries, food and even beer!”"

I am an Australian passport holder- and we generally get 90 days on arrival in Malaysia- I have been coming here for 20 years, often. I was about to get married to my Malaysian wife in March (registration postponed by JPN due to lockdown). We have been together for many years, finally got married in June, after lockdown, but a spousal visa can not be applied for before 6 months' of marriage (which is inhumane also, in my book- does that mean a newly wed must leave his spouse/family behind ??).
I also have had a job offer, which secures/generates 24 immediate jobs (in turn generating many downstream jobs) for Malaysians and considerable local investment.The employer applied for the expat workers visa before lockdown, however the application had lapsed in the system during MCO and needs to be 're-loaded'- which I have been told for weeks will happen 'next week' via the immigration agent. I tried to make an appointment to see Immigration, but they are too busy to provide a slot- it seems and are booked out till August-no confirmation email yet.
Of course it will be inhumane and cruel to seperate my wife from myself, as if I am a criminal, or afflict that any tourist for that matter- already here. It makes no sense to force tourists into closed quarters with others because of a black swan event, they could not for see. On top of that, no flights exist going back to Perth ( my residential city prior to marriage) if I search 400 airlines for the foreseeable future-possibly up to next year.
I also love Malaysia (I kept donating blood for instance during this time to keep people alive- with blood stocks were very low). I love the friendly Malaysian people and do not wish to be detained or deported or have the local jobs lost or uproot my family exposing them to a higher risk of contraction of the virus being on a plane or in quarantine on arrival, with no prospect of returning in the short term.
If countries can take in refugees and asylum seekers, why could Malaysian Immigration not grant clemency to healthy visitors/spouses or investors that are already in some way, investing here. These visa's or the right to stay, will have to be extended on a blanket basis until the world is normal again, or you will see people being reluctant to return ever again, let alone invest and may disinvest from the country completely.
A pandemic is tough enough, manage the virus- don't punish the countries benefactors.

We cannot let those who are laid off and their families go hungry or be unable to avail of the healthcare they need!
Liew Chin Tong, a good friend of mine, is one on the very few Pakatan Harapan leaders who is turning his mind to the economic challenges the country will be facing for the remainder of 2020.
In his opinion piece in Malaysiakini on 12 May 2020 “A post-Covid 19 economic agenda for Malays”, Liew identifies the various sectors of the global economy that will be affected adversely by the Covid-19 pandemic and the impact this will have on Malaysia. He surmises, correctly, that unemployment will be a huge problem in Malaysia, but then goes on to suggest a solution that is somewhat off the mark.
Liew’s suggested solution is to “create jobs that pay decently. Everything else flows from here. All other objectives should be subjected to this primary objective. The creation of decently paid jobs should be front and centre as far as economic discourse is concerned.”
I disagree. Job creation is of course an important objective and most of Liew’s 10 suggestions to create jobs have their merits and should be explored within the limits of our financial capacity.
But we have to be realistic. We are not going to be able to create enough jobs for the two or three million people who are going to lose their jobs in the next few months. These will include workers employed in aviation, the airports, hotels, the tourism sector, workers in factories whose overseas orders have been slashed, Malaysians working abroad who return to Malaysia because they have lost their jobs, construction sector workers, oil and gas sector workers and helpers in night bazaars that have either closed or downsized because of the need for social distancing.
While the creation of well-paying alternative jobs is a valid long-term goal, the primary objective currently should be to ensure that no family is left without an income sufficient to procure the essentials – food, shelter, basic utilities and healthcare – during this recessionary period. Other needs may be postponed but the above four cannot be, and we have to, as a society, ensure that every family has the means to get the essentials. We cannot compromise on this.
The best way of ensuring that no family is short on food is by implementing a modified universal basic income scheme or UBI, which would pay RM1,000 monthly to the households listed in the Bantuan Prihatin Negara (National Caring Assistance) scheme which meet the eligibility criteria."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=232","Jun 18, 2020 1:14 PM","FancyMe","These criteria are to screen out (exclude) families which have at least one parent who is from any one of the following categories – person for whom a company is contributing to the Social Security Organisation (Socso), civil servants, the 1.8 million individuals who paid income tax in 2019, and civil service pensioners with a pension of more than RM1,000. These are persons with an adequate and stable income who do not require the assistance of the UBI to meet essential needs.
The rationale for income support is this: none of the two or three million people who are going to end up unemployed can be held personally responsible for their predicament. It is not because they are lazy or that they refused to go to work."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=232","Jun 18, 2020 1:14 PM","FancyMe","Their predicament is due to a failure of the market economy. And those who lose their jobs will find it difficult to land alternative jobs until the world economy emerges from the recession, and that will take one or two years.
We cannot let them and their families go hungry or be unable to avail of the healthcare they need. A caring society with a slogan of “shared rosperity” must make sure that no one is left behind. It’s high time to walk the talk!
The UBI scheme should also be extended to all single individuals above 21 using the same exclusion criteria outlined earlier. These singles eligible for UBI could be paid RM300 per month. This isn’t a huge sum, but would help these individuals manage in these difficult times until they get a job.
A UBI payment of RM1,000 per month for a family is just enough to buy provisions for a simple diet for the family. But it may not be enough to meet other basic needs such as rent."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=232","Jun 18, 2020 1:14 PM","FancyMe","We need a separate programme to handle the issue of rent for families in cases where breadwinners are laid off. (The Socialist Party of Malaysia or PSM statement released on 30 April 2020, sketches out the features of a rent support programme.) We also need to consider a rebate for the first RM30 of the water bill and the first RM100 of electricity charges.
This UBI scheme will pump in RM2-3bn into the Malaysian economy every month. The families assisted would tend to buy foodstuffs with low import content (as they are cheaper) and this will expand the market for the food supply chains in the country.
This in turn will help preserve the jobs of Malaysian farmers, workers in Malaysian factories processing food, workers involved in the transport and distribution of food, and petty traders in our markets and night markets. The UBI will serve not only as an emergency lifeline to retrenched workers and their families but will also help arrest the fall in employment.
How we deal with widespread unemployment isn’t an abstract academic issue that can be debated in a leisurely manner. The Bantuan Prihatin Negara scheme paid out RM1,000 to close to four million families from the bottom 40% of households in April and another RM600 to these families in May. It was a great help to the families which received it.

Malaysians all over the nation rallied to collect money and arrange emergency rations to families in need over the past two months. This is laudable and it shows there is an underlying spirit of solidarity among the people.
But private initiative will not be enough to tackle need at the scale we will witness. The government has to step in and implement a comprehensive income support scheme for all those families who find themselves without a job.

Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) is proposing a designated hub interconnecting Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0 or 4IR) players in Malaysia to the rest of the world.
Newly appointed chairman Datuk Dr Rais Hussin (pic) is mooting the initiative, saying a solid regulatory framework and strategic oversight were needed to set the direction.
""It will be aligned to the government's Prihatin package (implemented to help people, companies and country weather the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic) and Penjana (short-term economic revival plan) programmes,"" he said in a statement Tuesday (June 16).
Covid-19 had accelerated the migration of society from physical infrastructures onto digital infrastructures, he said.
""At the cusp of IR 4.0, we are blessed with the chance to re-engineer the human experiment using technologies that decentralise authority and de-emphasise divisions along the lines of colour, creed and country – what the Japanese have coined as ‘Society 5.0’.
""And Society 5.0 holds the promise to converge these environments together through the use of IR 4.0 technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain and fintech (financial services technology).
“I envision MDEC as playing a leading role in catalysing this transition for Malaysia and Malaysians,"" he said.
On June 12, the Communications and Multimedia Ministry announced Rais’ appointment as MDEC chairman for two years, effective June 15.
He has been for some years a strategist at Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia, and together with blockchain expert Dinis Guarda, had recently co-authored a book titled 4IR: Reinventing a Nation that was launched during the global Frankfurt book fair in October last year.
""The book was designed as a blueprint of sorts to assist governments of developing nations in their digital transformation agenda.
""Digital transformation presents both challenges and opportunities to us all. Those who succeed can use IR 4.0 technologies to create a better life for all, including new and more meaningful jobs, reskilling of the workforce, better health and education, and smarter and greener cities,"" he said.
Rais added that companies and households were now in a recovery mode after months of living under the movement control order (MCO), implemented since March 18 to curb Covid-19 infections.
""We are now emerging from the crisis,"" he said, adding that the ensuing recovery would rely largely upon a managed digital transformation towards establishing “Malaysia 5.0”, which he described as a new narrative for Malaysia as an “innovation economy” that can compete in a disruptive technology world, serve as a springboard into Asean (the Association of South-East Asian Nations), a bridge between Asia, the Middle East and Africa, and interconnect with the 1.8 billion Islamic population worldwide.
MDEC would play a leading role in introducing the emerging technologies that were essential tools in the new Malaysia 5.0 digital economy, added Rais.
“With or without the crisis, if we were to migrate into a high-wage, knowledge-based economy envisioned in the Shared Prosperity Vision (SPV) 2030, then we must give more than lip service to encourage innovation, retrain the workforce, and incentivise investment,"" he said."

Surveillance and monitoring invade European post-pandemic workplaces"

At Bouygues SA construction sites and in Sanofi and Schneider Electric SE offices in France employees enter after thermal cameras check their temperatures. Invisible lasers manage crowds at shopping malls and transport hubs in Spain and France, and some firms use infection-tracing lanyard devices.
As Europeans head back to work, they’re entering a world very different from the one they left. Workplaces from banks and offices to e-commerce warehouses, factories, sports clubs and airports are trying out or installing fever-testing thermal cameras, mask-detection systems and tracking software to prevent a resurgence of the coronavirus that has claimed more than 167,000 lives in the region.
The virus has opened the doors to surveillance and monitoring technologies that many fear are here to stay. While such systems have been creeping into people’s lives across the globe — particularly in Asia, with China’s facial-recognition points system and South Korea’s invasive infection-tracking software — the trend runs up against Europe’s much-vaunted privacy culture. Europeans trading in privacy for safety now may find the longer-term consequences unacceptable.
“The use of mass surveillance infrastructures can lead to a normalization of these highly intrusive tools, and the hasty introduction of apps, devices and cameras will, in the long term, lead to a dissolution of trust between employers and employees,” said Ella Jakubowska, a researcher at internet rights association Edri.
Businesses are walking a fine line between keeping people safe and protecting their privacy. The absence of clear guidance from European regulators is forcing companies — who could also be on the hook if they don’t sufficiently protect workers — to make “extremely difficult decisions,” according to Daniel Cooper, a partner at law firm Covington and Burling, who advises clients on tech regulation."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=232","Jun 18, 2020 1:40 PM","THEREALDEAL","“The exposure of companies collecting that information goes up because it’s sensitive,” Cooper said. “They also have to balance the privacy rights of the people whose data they’re collecting and get that balance right and not break the law.”
About 23 percent of companies surveyed globally are considering workplace tracking or contact tracing to transition back to on-site work, according to a study published this month by tax and consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is testing its own contact tracing tool in its Shanghai office.
Providers of such technologies tout them as a safe way to get people back to work and revive economies crushed by lockdowns. While many acknowledge the systems aren’t foolproof, they say infection risk can be capped.
“Our bracelets are tools to keep workers safe and to increase performance,” said John Baekelmans, the chief executive officer of Rombit, the Belgian company whose 100-gram bracelets will add a tracing feature in June to allow Antwerp port doctors to keep track of a possible spread of the virus.
Rombit sees the bracelets outlasting the virus as companies use them to track employees’ health and performance. The company says it will supply such devices to 300 companies in the coming weeks.
Like Rombit, Poland-based Estimote Inc. is selling social distancing devices to factories, research centers and hospitals, which also let them trace contacts made by any infected staffer.
The devices, attached to lanyards, buzz when workers have spent too much time near a colleague. Employees developing symptoms or testing positive can press a button on the gadget to notify the company, allowing it to trace all the people they’ve been in contact with.
“It’s in our DNA to come close” to other people, said Estimote CEO Jakub Krzych, adding that the devices alert users to those habits, keeping the spread of the virus in check.
Herta Security in Barcelona is developing both mask-detection technology and facial recognition for touchless access in workplaces, including for a global retail company that’s considering using it in its offices in Europe and Latin America, according to Laura Blanc Pedregal, Herta’s Chief Marketing Officer.
Shopping malls and major transport hubs in Spain, France, Israel and the U.S. will be using Paris-based Outsight’s laser technology to ensure social distancing, its president and co-founder Raul Bravo said. Aeroports de Paris, which manages the French capital’s airports, is testing Outsight lasers to monitor passenger flows.
Fever-checking thermal cameras are also starting to become ubiquitous. In Madrid, University Camilo Jose Cela is setting up a Chinese camera system that simultaneously measures students’ temperatures and checks if they’re wearing masks. Airports including London’s Heathrow and Paris’s Charles de Gaulle are testing thermal cameras."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=232","Jun 18, 2020 1:40 PM","THEREALDEAL","“We sell more cameras every week,” said Guenther Mull, CEO of German biometrics company Dermalog Identification Systems GmbH, which offers mask detection as an add-on to its software. “The demand is currently very high.”
Privacy advocates are alarmed. Thermal cameras could be seen as an invasion of privacy, said Rob van Eijk, managing director for Europe at the Future of Privacy Forum, a nonprofit think tank.
“It would pressure individuals with relatively higher body temperatures to disclose or divulge, likely against their will, their personal health information that might be unrelated to COVID-19 or other respiratory viral infections,” he said.
In Europe, where breaching data protection laws can result in a fine of as much as 4 percent of annual global revenue, companies typically wouldn’t link temperature readings to names or store the information. Still, fever readings wouldn’t be difficult to trace back to an individual, said Covington and Burling’s Cooper.
For now, the checks are being taken in stride. Consider the employees of Bayer 04 Leverkusen, the German soccer club, which invested in five Dermalog thermal cameras. When the Bundesliga became the first major soccer league to resume playing last weekend, the club was ready. It had been scanning its players when they came in for training.
In late April, while much of Germany was sheltering in place, professional soccer player Leon Bailey stood at the entrance of the club’s training facilities to have his temperature taken. The camera zeroed in on his forehead to read a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius. No fever. He passed through the arena’s gates and joined his teammates for practice.
“They see it’s for their own safety,” said Dr. Karl-Heinrich Dittmar, Bayer Leverkusen’s medical director, in an interview. “Nobody wants to become ill.”"

KUALA LUMPUR: Negri Sembilan Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) chairman Tan Sri Dr Rais Yatim was among the five individuals sworn in as senators before the Senate president Tan Sri SA Vigneswaran at Dewan Negara today.
All of them were appointed upon the consent of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri’ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah.
The other four were former Home Minister Tan Sri Mohd Radzi Sheikh Ahmad, PAS vice-president Idris Ahmad, head of PAS Supporters Club N Balasubramaniam, and former Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s political secretary Muhammad Zahid Md Arip.
The Senate now has 70 members, 26 of whom were state appointees, while 44 others were appointed by the King, including three to represent the Federal Territories of Kuala Lumpur and Labuan.
The senators are appointed for a term of three years and can only be reappointed once.
Meanwhile, speaking to the media, Rais said among his missions is to make the Senate, which is one of the components of the highest legislative body of the country, a good example to the people.
“I think it would be good if the image of the Senate is changed to a highly intellectual assembly ... building the nation not through harsh words, but through an exemplary image that could help shape the future generations.
“We have no time to do flip flop, all senators should develop a common determination to strengthen the government and to give the people the opportunity to see that the Senate is actually higher than the Dewan Rakyat in so many aspects,” he said.
Meanwhile, Idris said as a senator, he would want to see more priority to be given to people’s agenda, and less to political games.
“We realise that the people need assurance to have food to eat, to live a peaceful life, so we don’t want to portray that politicians care too preoccupied in politics while they (the people) are struggling to make ends meet,” he said."

The current backdoor government, knowing that the cabinet and senior positions are depleted of minorities, did not blink to consider a non-Malay minority to lead the august House.
This, I really really hope is an act of desperation by Muhiyuddin but I highly doubt it.

These curveballs have paved the way for an interesting decade ahead as global economic growth is expected to meander along going forward.

This year is an important one for the US because of the presidential election on Nov 3 — an election that will be closely watched by the global community as it could determine the fate of the US-China trade war.
Some believe that Trump’s re-election as US president for a second term could result in a prolonged trade war with China, even though both countries have agreed to the so-called Phase 1 trade deal. Trump is expected to continue with his agenda of “Making America Great Again” if he is re-elected.
At present, the US has cancelled a further 15% tariff on US$150 billion (RM615 billion) worth of imports from China that was supposed to take effect in December and has taken steps to cut tariffs imposed since September 2019 on US$120 billion worth of goods from 15% to 7.5%.
China, on the other hand, according to US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, has pledged to purchase an additional US$16 billion in agriculture goods over the next two years.
As things stand, however, Trump will first have to survive an impeachment trial in the Senate for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. He is the third president in US history to be charged with committing high crimes and misdemeanors, but his popularity ratings have not been hit by the impeachment.
The latest polls tracked by FiveThirtyEight show his approval rating at 42.6%, representing the upper end of the range since he took office in January 2017."

Despite a pause in the trade war, geopolitical risk remains at a high. The political situation in the US aside, European politics are also calling out for attention.
With Brexit set to happen after a three-year deadlock, the UK and the European Union will soon negotiate the terms of their divorce. Will there be an amicable resolution? Already many fear the UK economy could suffer a deeper-than-expected shock during the transition process.
Conflict in the Middle East is another worry as the region has been mired in war and strife for many years.
“We see flashpoints in the fragile Middle East, including fallout from attacks on Saudi oil facilities, Turkey’s incursion into Syria and protests around the region,” BlackRock Investment Institute observes in a report.

In the last decade, the populist movement has been on an undeniable rise, starting from Trump’s triumphant presidential win that set in motion similar upsets around the globe, including in Turkey, Hungary, Italy and the Philippines. The outcome of the Brexit referendum was yet another instance of the populace moving to the right.
The disillusionment with capitalism and rising inequality has contributed to a large extent to the rise in populism as established leaders are increasingly perceived to be unable to address the changes happening in the global economy.
Chile, one of the latest to be snared in the populist movement, has been in unrest for several months after protesters took to the streets because of an increase in subway fares. But commentators say the unrest is underscored by years of inequality and the high cost of living.
As with the US, the populist movement has led to protectionism, anti-immigration policies and other policies that are viewed as anti-globalisation — in turn, seen as detrimental for economies globally as trade and immigation form an important part of sustainable long-term growth.
The years ahead will continue to put populist leaders and their governance on the centre stage. Time will reveal if their policies and strategies can appease the masses without compromising economic growth."

Observers say the political situation in Malaysia is a wild card, a key issue being the leadership post-Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.
During the 14th general election in 2018, it was agreed that Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim would succeed him after two years in office, but there seems to be less clarity on the matter now as Mahathir has been vague on the handover date.
The thorny matter aside, sentiment on the ground also suggests that the people are dissatisfied with the performance of the coalition government, which has been beset by constant infighting to the dismay of voters who had pinned their hopes on a “New Malaysia”.
Voter dissatisfaction was demonstrated in the recent Tanjung Piai by-election where Pakatan Harapan received less than 30% of votes cast, giving Barisan Nasional a landslide win.
2020 is all the more significant for Malaysia as the two-year mark for Mahathir’s being in office draws near. Will he hand over the reins of power to Anwar as agreed, or will a new contender emerge?
Sadly, many foresee more infighting within the coalition this year.
This does not bode well for Malaysia economically as foreign investors will shy away from a country deemed to have unstable politics and unclear policies."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=235","Jun 22, 2020 9:29 AM","Zoologist","5 Pace of economic growth
The trade war was one of the biggest wild cards in 2019. It is expected to continue to be one factor that could either ease or aggravate uncertainties and the economic growth of nations in 2020 and beyond.
Currently, the jury is out on whether global growth in 2020 will be better or worse than in 2019. The International Monetary Fund projects a mild recovery from 2019, and for global growth to touch 3.4% — a downward adjustment of 0.1% to the IMF’s initial October forecast.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Bank are more bearish, the former projecting a dip in 2020 to 2.9% and the latter 2.7%.
OCBC Bank economist Howie Lee says in a report that he does not see any suitable growth catalyst that could return global growth to the Great Moderation period — the time before the 2008 global financial crisis.
That said, a bright spot appears to be the abating of the risk of a global recession.
On the local front, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has pegged gross domestic product (GDP) growth at 4.8%, in contrast with more subdued expectations.
In a report, AllianceDBS Research notes that business and consumer sentiments are not only uninspiring but extremely dismal. “This does not bode well for the future given the critical role of private consumption and investment as a key growth driver.
“Critically, business sentiment has dropped to a depressed level that was never seen over the past 20 years, indicating the poor appetite among business owners for more investment in the near term,” explains the research house, whose GDP forecast is 4.5%.
Will the government’s efforts to boost economic activity through Budget 2020 help?"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=235","Jun 22, 2020 9:29 AM","Zoologist","6 Lower interest rates
An escalation in trade tensions last year and slower growth momentum prompted the US Federal Reserve to pause its rate hikes. Instead, it chose to cut rates and extend its purchase of short-term Treasury bills.
The rate cut by the Fed sparked a series of cuts globally. Malaysia reduced interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) in May 2019 to 3%, ahead of the US rate cut, in a bid to stimulate the economy.
Will there be more rate reductions in the coming months since many believe 2020 will be even more challenging notwithstanding MOF’s forecast of a slight improvement in GDP growth?
Whether or not Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) moves to trim interest rates will depend on the economic data to come. It is worth noting that the central bank had already reduced the statutory reserve requirement to 3% from 3.5% in November, a move that is expected to boost liquidity in the system.
Nevertheless, many see room for further interest rate cuts this year. CGS-CIMB Research notes in a report that the cautious global outlook and the “hairline cracks” in domestic resilience call for further monetary loosening. It expects two 25bps cuts in the next 12 months.
While monetary policy is not the only measure to stimulate economic growth, is there wiggle room in Malaysia’s coffers to unleash other forms of stimulus?"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=235","Jun 22, 2020 9:29 AM","Zoologist","7 Uplift for commodity prices
Brent crude oil prices have been pretty stable, hovering around US$60 per barrel in 2019.
In 2020, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects Brent crude price to average US$61 per barrel, while national petroleum company Petroliam Nasional Bhd puts it in the high US$50s.
According to Maybank Investment Bank Research, crude oil is expected to continue to remain stable at US$60 to US$65 per barrel this year — a level seen palatable to everyone and sufficient to keep capital expenditure going.
Maybank has forecast US$369 billion in offshore exploration and production (E&P) investments globally over a three-year period from 2019 to 2021 — slightly more than double the US$155 billion in the previous three years (2016 to 2018).
In a recent December meeting, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) agreed to cut oil production by another 500,000 barrels per day for the first quarter of 2020, bringing total production to 1.7 million barrels per day.
The move to cut oil production globally should help to further support oil prices, but the persistent worry is that the supply of crude oil will outstrip demand as growth wavers.
A bright spot is the price recovery of crude palm oil (CPO) — another important local commodity.
As at Jan 2, CPO prices settled at RM3,049.50 per tonne — the highest since February 2017 — thanks to India’s recent move to cut import tax on Southeast Asian palm oil.
Kenanga Research outlines three factors that are expected to drive the recovery of CPO — the laggard impact of the dry weather thus reducing output in 2020, China’s increase in palm oil consumption on the back of the swine flu outbreak, and higher consumption in Indonesia and Malaysia owing to the increase in percentage of CPO in biofuel policies."

The high cost of living is still affecting almost all segments of society despite Pakatan Harapan’s (PH) attempts to bring down prices.
Among its initiatives were the abolishment of the goods and services tax (GST), which was replaced with the sales and services tax (SST), continuing the Bantuan Sara Hidup for the B40 group and ongoing plans to implement targeted fuel subsidies.
Over the current decade, PH’s Shared Prosperity Vision 2030 will be of interest to many as its goal is for Malaysia to achieve sustainable, equitable, inclusive and balanced economic growth.
Targets include raising the B40 monthly household income to RM5,800 by 2030 from RM3,000 presently, increasing the employee compensation to nominal GDP ratio to 48% from 35.7%, and raising the small and medium enterprise and micro businesses’ share of GDP to 50%.
This year, the 12th Malaysia Plan will also be unveiled. The development blueprint, which will set the tone for the nation’s economic direction and policies moving forward, has the potential to contribute to the nation’s prosperity.
How these targets will be achieved will depend largely on the way the 12th Malaysia Plan is executed and implemented."

Having manifested in various forms over the last decade, the gig economy is here to stay and is sure to morph in the decade to come.
Data connectivity and social media have been two of the largest enablers of the gig economy.
Randstad Malaysia explains the gig economy as consisting of companies that engage contract workers for a temporary period or project-based jobs, instead of hiring them for permanent positions.
World Bank data shows that about 25.3% of the Malaysian workforce are freelancers — participants of the gig economy — and expects this number to grow further.
OCBC economist Lee says the gig economy has enabled less-skilled workers to earn a meaningful income by completing a “plethora of jobs” instead of relying on a single employer.
“This decade might be too soon to call for an end to 9-to-5 jobs, but the trend looks to be leaning in that direction as institutions offload the risk of employment from the organisations to the individuals,” notes Lee.

Although technology has provided opportunities for people to earn more, it also has an ugly side if not well-managed.
These days, technological advancements have allowed robots to work faster than any human on an assembly line — with almost zero errors, thereby increasing productivity. In more recent cases, artificial intelligence technologies have made breakthroughs, allowing predictive analysis.
This decade could possibly see a larger number of job displacements as technology replaces more routine and less-skilled jobs.
Among countries in Southeast Asia, Singapore’s labour market is said to be the one that will face the largest degree of job displacements in this decade. It is only a matter of time before it hits Malaysian shores as well.
Human Resource Minister M Kula Segaran has urged Malaysians to upskill so they can move up the value chain and to be flexible enough to adapt to new ideas, innovations and technologies.
He has stressed the urgency to ensure there are highly skilled workers who will be able to drive innovation and support economic growth in the future.
Perhaps this decade will be one where people take calls to upskill themselves more seriously as the threat of displacement becomes more real."

Interest rates play an important role in the financial system. Being a key figure in determining the attractiveness of assets around the globe, it is watched closely by analysts, economists as well as investors.
But as Covid-19 shattered global economies and pushed countries towards recession, central banks worldwide have taken measures to ease interest rates to boost consumer spending and financial liquidity.
How does it actually work?
Take, for example, a housing loan. Usually, the interest rate on mortgages ranges between 4.0 percent and 4.5 percent, depending on banks, but when the central bank lowers the rate, borrowing becomes cheaper and thus more affordable.
Consumers will therefore have extra money in hand, allowing them to spend it and subsequently helping to support economic growth.
However, it is important to note that interest rate cuts only act as a supplementary move by the government to boost the economy.
Since the pandemic became a global crisis, governments have injected trillions of dollars into the economy in various forms, such as financial aids, wage subsidies, tax cuts and financial moratoriums.
In Malaysia, the government had introduced two economic stimulus packages, namely the RM260 billion Prihatin Rakyat Economic Stimulus Package and the RM35 billion National Economic Recovery Plan (PENJANA) to revitalise the local economy.
Global cuts
US: The US Federal Reserve (Fed) had cut its interest rates to almost zero in light of the Covid-19 global pandemic which had forced business activities to come to a grinding halt.
US Fed chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the low interest rates are expected to remain until 2022 until the economy recovers from the pandemic.
UK: The Bank of England kept its interest rates at 0.1 percent this month after slashing it in March. There has been talk among economists that the economic powerhouse is expected to take a negative interest rate approach.
The bank has also announced a £100 billion stimulus to help the United Kingdom's economy through the Covid-19 pandemic.
Europe: The European Central Bank lowered its interest rate to 0.5 percent in April as the Covid-19 pandemic had slammed the region's economy.
The bank has lent out 1.3 trillion euros to Euro zone banks at negative interest rates of as low as minus 1.0 percent, provided that the banks keep lending to businesses.
Russia: Russia had slashed its benchmark interest rate by 100 basis point to 4.50 percent on Friday - a record low dating back to the pre-Soviet era as the bank felt the need to cut credit lending expenses due to its shrinking economy.
Indonesia: The republic's central bank reduced its interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent last week after keeping it at 4.5 percent over the past three months, in line with the country's lowest inflation in almost two decades.
Bank Indonesia governor Perry Warjiyo said the rate cut was to provide a much-needed boost for economic recovery amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
Thailand: The country's central bank has introduced additional debt relief measures, including interest rate cuts by two to four percentage points for credit cards and personal loans, to help debtors during the coronavirus outbreak.
More cuts in M'sia
AmBank Group chief economist Dr Anthony Dass said the possibility of the central bank reducing the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) by another 50 basis points in July remains high.
""The rate cut will provide a much-needed boost for economic recovery amidst the Covid-19 pandemic.
""It will help stabilise the national economy and ensure Penjana's success,"" he said.
Dass, who is also a member of the Economic Action Council secretariat, said the cut would be timely as the government plans to raise RM35 billion through local borrowings to finance the higher deficit.
""There is ample liquidity to tap into the local market borrowings today. Besides, there is hardly any inflationary pressure so far,"" he said.
Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) had cut the OPR by 50 basis points to 2.0 percent in May, putting the OPR at its lowest level since the global financial crisis in 2008-2009.
The Monetary Policy Committee will be holding its fourth meeting on July 7, and analysts are expecting another OPR cut following the meeting.
An analyst said the OPR cut is expected to boost financial liquidity in the upcoming quarter as unemployment has started to spike due to the pandemic.
""As the World Bank and BNM have forecast a recession this year due to the global pandemic, it is important to ensure that consumers have enough liquidity to ensure their purchasing power does not slip further and businesses can keep on running,"" she said.
She added that for now, a lower interest rate might have an impact on fixed deposit savings, but it will only be a short-term impact as the economy is expected to recover next year."

In the scheme of things Malaysia's problems is hardly just an interest rate issue.
In fact such low rates with a resource dependent economy with depressed demand and prices, add to that corruption could mean more outflows of monies and possibly a run against the ringgit. Any of you brilliant fly by night economists factored that in?"

Oh Tong Keong has urged the federal government to pay RM500 to unemployed individuals in the B40 category from now until December.
In a statement today, Oh said although the government had allowed individuals to withdraw RM500 a month from their Employees Provident Fund ""account 2"", it was not enough.
""If the 'account 2' was emptied out, then the future of (unemployed people) would be affected. They will need money for their children's education and medical bills (in the future),"" he said.
The i-Lestari Account 2 Withdrawal Scheme allows depositors to withdraw RM500 a month for a period of 12 months.
This was part of the wider Prihatin stimulus package, which also includes one-time cash handouts ranging from RM500 to RM1,600 for individuals or households with an income of RM4,000 and below.
Oh (above) said many people are now unemployed because of the Covid-19 outbreak, and those in the hospitality, hotel, catering, transport, education and retail industry are hit especially hard.
""Many economists had warned the government to be wary of the effects of the Covid-19 outbreak, but the government did not put in place the right strategy and things are getting worse now.
""Although the Perikatan Nasional government has handled the Covid-19 outbreak well, it is still slow in helping the people. We hope this problem can be resolved soon,"" he said.
According to the Department of Statistics, unemployment numbers had hit a record high of 778,800 or five percent of the total workforce.

""My aim in life is to serve, provide my expertise and contribute my capabilities to USM, my students, my community and my family,"" said Bahari, who graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the South Australian Institute of Technology in Australia in 1989.
To fulfil a requirement by the Malaysian Public Service Department (JPA), which specifies that those who intend to serve in the public sector need to have an Honours degree, he then pursued an additional year of study at Flinders University, Australia (1991) to obtain an Honours before completing his Doctoral studies (Ph.D) at Leeds University, United Kingdom (1995)."

""Around the 1960s, conditions were different than how it is now. Added to the fact that staying in an Orang Asli village that was about 20km from the nearest town, which was Tanjung Tualang, everything was less than rosy.
""In fact, I only came to know in the later years from my late mother that all my other siblings had passed away, leaving only me and my elder sister, without knowing the exact cause of their deaths.
""There was no electricity in our village, and we were fortunate enough to get clean water supply from tin miners, who by chance lived close to the village. It was water from three main pipes that was shared with the whole village."

Bahari was raised by his mother single-handedly, and being illiterate, education to her was not a priority.
What mattered most then was the means to earn a living and to continue with life. She did all kinds of work, from searching for forest produce to working for farmers in minding their crops, to make ends meet.
However, he was proud of his mother who was very dear to him, because despite her shortcomings, she had always supported him in his pursuit of knowledge and always tried her best to provide for his needs, including school uniform, shoes, pocket money and so forth."

""External factors were also helpful in giving the right motivation to individuals from minority groups as with me, where support at home was very minimal in assisting and promoting formal education.

Not forgetting his roots, Bahari also shared some insights and advice to the minority groups such as himself, with the hope of encouraging and inspiring them to also attain success.
He said what was important was that those out there needed to persevere what they hope to achieve, as the challenges faced by this group in whatever area or at whichever level would be twice as hard compared to the general society.
""For the Orang Asli specifically, the challenge to adapt, the dominating sense of togetherness (being different from others) and other aspects are among the 'unwritten' issues which need to be dealt with simultaneously along with other challenges faced by the general society.

Experts and celebrities alike have suggested that this new coronavirus outbreak is a form of punishment from the planet. Alan Levinovitz, author of Natural: The Seductive Myth of Nature’s Goodness, says we mustn't equate 'natural' with 'better'."

When I lived in China, wandering through the open-air stalls felt liberating and authentic, a welcome change from sterile supermarkets where the chicken lies behind glass, plastic-wrapped by faceless corporations.
Similarly, Chinese medicine represents a natural alternative to the pills pushed by Big Pharma. Gnarled roots, ground herbs, wizened mushrooms, and exotic animal parts line the traditional pharmacy’s walls. These claim to be Mother Nature’s cures that will realign us with her rhythms, unlike the synthetic chemicals that, according to some, will end up making society sicker.
Now, of course, we are reckoning with the catastrophic shortcomings of unregulated open-air wet markets. Calls for change within China will hopefully lead to safer food standards and reduced exotic animal trade."

Circulating on social media is the idea that ‘humans are the virus’, yet the arguments towards this are suspiciously general, theological catch-alls: they take every human sin, and discover that all of them contribute to the current crisis.
Is industrial agriculture one’s focus? Then it is to blame for the coronavirus. Likewise for overconsumption and climate change.
The ultimate version of this approach, now a viral meme on social nature, is simply to blame humans for all disharmony in nature. The virus isn’t the problem, since viruses can’t sin. They are a part of nature – perfect and harmonious unless humans interfere. We, the sinners, are the virus."

“Nature is sending us a message,” said Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN Environment Programme. Or, as the Duchess of York tweeted: “Mother Nature has sent us to our rooms… like the spoilt children we are. She gave us time and she gave us warnings. She was so patient with us. She gave us fire and floods, she tried to warn us but in the end she took back control.”
Though ‘nature’ may look like a secular term, this framing is fundamentally a religious one. Religious leaders throughout history have framed natural disasters as God’s punishment – even today, prominent figures blame coronavirus on ‘unnatural’ se.xuality, just as they did with everything from hurricanes to HIV."

The opposite of natural is anything chosen by humans that does not align with the divine order – and it leads inevitably to suffering.
Understandably we want to believe natural forces are benevolent. That’s why studies show we tend to overestimate the risk of actions perceived as tampering with nature, from nuclear power plants to lab-grown meat. We know what happened when Dr Frankenstein tampered with nature, or, as it’s often put, when he ‘played God’"

The urgency of living in harmony with nature has never been more acute. But we should not make the mistake of believing that living in harmony with nature requires living naturally. After all, the technology required for renewable energy is far less natural than simply burning wood. Refrigeration and freezing prevent spoilage and food waste.
Humans are, as the author HG Wells put it, unnatural animals. Our success in saving infants and the elderly contradicts nature’s intentions, and few would deny the morality of our unnatural efforts. And yet, given the susceptibility of the elderly to COVID-19, the narrative of nature’s punishment makes for a ghastly conclusion about whether we should continue with our successes."

The public healthcare system would not collapse if hospital beds are reserved for severe cases. Others should be advised to stay at home, upon medical advice, and try to recover.
Gov’ts should step up education on self-discipline to ensure the virus has no place to go and dies out.
Gov’ts should take another look at the whole concept of “cause of death” and medical education.
The focus on curative medicine should be replaced by preventive medicine despite there being not much money on the latter. The public welfare demands it.
It has been known for quite some time that “medical errors” cause 60 per cent of deaths.

If we are gracious about it, we can say the backdoor govt. cares very much for the younger generation and wants to shield them from possible covid19 infections.
Yet, I do not believe it to be the case. It looks like this illegitimate govt. is not giving due importance to education. If other sectors can be opened, schools and institutions should also be opened with the necessary SOPs.
To keep them closed when you open up other sectors show that government only has the RINGGIT sign in its eyes.
I believe I understand your drift when you refer to the covid 19 pandemic as ""Mother Nature’s way of pruning dead leaves and twigs""
But many young and still in the prime of their lives had been struck down by covid 19.
It is more like a storm raging through a forested area - yes, a lot of dead leaves and twigs are removed, but some young leaves and twigs are also felled.

The second wave of the 1918 virus used the stronger immune system of the younger against them. It tricked their immune system into an extreme cytokine reaction, causing their immune system to destroy the infected organs in an attempt to get at the virus.
The older were mainly spared because their weaker immune system took its time to eradicate the virus without destroying the infected organs.
So it is too soon draw any conclusion on this mutating corona virus."

Food and Drug Administration says drug is unlikely to work against coronavirus and notes heart risks
US regulators revoked the emergency authorization for malaria drugs championed by Donald Trump for treating Covid-19, amid growing evidence they don’t work and could cause serious side effects.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said on Monday the drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were unlikely to be effective in treating the coronavirus. Citing reports of heart complications, the agency said the drugs’ unproven benefits “do not outweigh the known and potential risks”.
Trump criticized the FDA decision. “I took it and I felt good about taking it. I don’t know if it had an impact, but it certainly didn’t hurt me,” Trump said"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=238","Jun 23, 2020 2:26 PM","Zillionaire","Trump said there had been “great reports” out of France, Spain and other places, without offering any evidence or further explanation. France is one of the countries that has already stopped using the drug for Covid-19 patients."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=238","Jun 23, 2020 2:26 PM","Zillionaire","In a separate announcement, the FDA also warned doctors against prescribing the drugs in combination with remdesivir, the lone drug currently shown to help patients with Covid-19. The agency said the anti-malaria drugs could reduce the effectiveness of remdesivir, which the FDA cleared for emergency use in May.
Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are frequently prescribed for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.
The FDA granted emergency use for the anti-malaria drugs in late March at the same time the US government accepted 30m doses of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine that had been donated by two foreign drug manufacturers. Millions of those doses were shipped to US hospitals to treat patients who weren’t enrolled in clinical trials."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=238","Jun 23, 2020 2:26 PM","Zillionaire","Meanwhile, no large, rigorous studies have found the drugs safe or effective for preventing or treating Covid-19. And a string of recent studies made clear they could do more harm than good.
The drugs can cause heart rhythm problems, severely low blood pressure and muscle or nerve damage. The FDA reported on Monday that it had received nearly 390 reports of complications with the drugs, including more than 100 involving serious heart problems. Such reports represent an incomplete snapshot of complications with the drugs because many side effects go unreported."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=238","Jun 23, 2020 2:27 PM","Zillionaire","The FDA’s move means that shipments of the drugs obtained by the federal government will no longer be distributed to state and local health authorities for use against the coronavirus. The decades-old drugs are still available for alternative FDA-approved uses.
Dr Steven Nissen, a Cleveland Clinic researcher who has been a frequent FDA adviser, agreed with the decision and said he would not have granted emergency access in the first place."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=238","Jun 23, 2020 2:27 PM","Zillionaire","“There has never been any high-quality evidence suggesting that hydroxychloroquine is effective” for treating or preventing coronavirus infection, he said, but there was evidence of serious side effects.
In March, Trump said hydroxychloroquine used in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin had “a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine”, with little evidence to back up that claim.
He later said he took the drugs preventively after two people who worked at the White House were diagnosed with Covid-19, and he urged others to try it.
After Trump’s repeated promotions, prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine soared, contributing to shortages.
The only remaining drug with FDA authorization against Covid-19 is remdesivir, an intravenous medication from Gilead Sciences that has been shown to help severely ill, hospitalized patients recover faster."

The Education Ministry said the mid-semester school holidays for Semester Two will now be from Aug 20 to 28 while the year-end school holidays will be from Dec 18 to 31, depending on the state.
This is a four-day reduction for the mid-semester break from nine days to five days.
The year-end holidays for schools in Johor, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu have been reduced from 42 days to 14 days, while schools in Melaka, Negri Sembilan, Pahang, Perak, Perlis, Penang, Sabah,
Sarawak, Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, Labuan and Putrajaya will have a 13-day holiday, the ministry said in a statement on Tuesday (June 23).
“The ministry amended the 2020 School Academic Calendar to assist schools in planning the students' teaching and learning process, ” it said.
The total number of physically being in school days is now 168 for all schools, it added.
Form Five and Form Six students spent at least 55 days learning from home throughout the movement control order (MCO), conditional MCO and recovery MCO period, it continued.
As for the other school students, the ministry said the total number of days spent learning from home will depend on when they will return to school.

This is not about teachers opposing the school term schedule, It is about neglecting teachers before taking the decision and previously on April education minister informed that the school term is unchanged despite the MCO holiday(which is something that teachers never asked for). During MCO period teachers are asked to provide worksheets in online platform, as many of the students doesn't have accessibility to google classroom , teachers have to come up with other alternative to ensure that the T&L is ongoing. Teachers need to do lesson plan and submit it to administrator during MCO. Teachers were asked to work from home. Despite all the hardmanship that teachers went through during this MCO period, what really upset the teachers are the work that they done during the MCO period is not counted. Btw school starts at 7.30am and ends at 1.45 pm (teachers are required to be at school before 7.00 am) and its not 8am-1pm work. We shall and should remember that teachers are the unsung frontliners who are not appreciated by many although they have done their best work during this MCO."

KUCHING: Sarawak authorities are investigating a Covid-19 patient in Miri for failing to declare her overseas travel history when returning to the state.
Deputy Chief Minister Datuk Amar Douglas Uggah said the woman, who recently returned from Tunisia, was in transit at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, where her rapid antigen test came back negative.
He said she was also randomly selected for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, but flew back to Miri the same day instead of waiting for the result the following day.
""When she arrived in Miri (on June 21), she filled in an e-health declaration form but did not state she was coming back from overseas. Therefore she was treated as a Sarawakian returning from Kuala Lumpur and not subject to quarantine.
""She went home but the following day the Miri Health Department was told that her PCR test was positive and she was then taken to the hospital in Miri,"" Uggah said at the state disaster management committee's briefing here on Wednesday (June 24).
He said the case was now under investigation as it was an offence to misinform authorities when filling in the e-health declaration form.
""We wish to remind the public to fill in the form honestly,"" he said.
Uggah also said Sarawak reported one new positive case on Wednesday (June 24), bringing the tally of confirmed cases to 570.
He said the latest case was a local project manager from the same construction company as the two Indonesian workers who tested positive on June 18.
""To date, 112 first-generation contacts and 312 second-generation contacts have been identified. Investigations are ongoing to identify other contacts and the source of infection,"" he said.
On the Kidurong cluster in Bintulu, Uggah said 217 close contacts had been identified and screened.
Eight people in the cluster have tested positive so far, while 206 tested negative and three more are awaiting results."

PUTRAJAYA (Bernama): Consumers who are not satisfied with the increase in their electricity bill during the movement control order (MCO) period can file their claims at the Tribunal for Consumer Claims Malaysia (TTPM).
Deputy Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Datuk Rosol Wahid said besides lodging complaints to Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) and the Energy Commission, consumers have another alternative to file their case with TTPM for a fee of only RM5.
""The issue of high electricity bill during the MCO has come to our attention. We noticed that many consumers have expressed dissatisfaction, ” he told Bernama here on Tuesday (June 16).
He added that the TTPM has received two claims so far, including one on the extraordinary spike of electricity bill, filed on June 5.
The increase in electricity bill has been seriously discussed by the consumers in the social media, and many have shared their frustrations with current electricity charges.
""File your case with TTPM for a RM5 fee, and it will be judged fairly, ” Rosol said.
TTPM was established on Nov 15,1999, to serve as an alternative channel for consumers to claim compensation regarding purchase of products or services, and the cases can be resolved within 60 days.
The tribunal also enables consumers to seek redress not exceeding RM50,000 for the purchase of products and services, which are not as advertised."

KOTA KINABALU: Efforts must be made to maintain the cleanliness of Tanjung Aru Beach and Prince Philip Park, and improve existing facilities for the convenience of locals and tourists alike.
Deputy Chief Minister Datuk Christina Liew emphasised these during her visit to the two destinations on Tuesday, following their recent reopening to the public.
She wants the public toilet to be upgraded while calling for additional toilets to be built in the area.
Liew, who is also Minister of Tourism, Culture and Environment, repeated her suggestion that a proper shed be put up to shelter visitors in the event of bad weather.
“The beach is very popular with tourists, particularly those from China and Korea, as Sabah boasts having one of the most beautiful sunsets in the world.
“It is vital to project a good image of Tanjung Aru Beach and Prince Philip Park for word-of-mouth marketing,” she said.
The Minister said Mayor Datuk Nordin Siman would seek the consent of the relevant authorities for execution of the proposed upgrading and improvement works.
Also present were the Ministry’s Permanent Secretary Dr Jamili Nais, Liew’s political secretaries Mustapha Sakmud and Vivien Lee, DBKK Director of Engineering, Jack Lo, Director of Landscaping, Robert Lipon, Director of Solid Waste Management, Leong Tze Fui, Director of Building Control, Sally Edward Ghani, and Api Api Community Development Leader, Grace Lee."

KUALA LUMPUR (June 23): Technology sector will see ""powerful acceleration"" growth in both revenue and earnings, according to Franklin Templeton Investments.
""Once we get through this crisis, we're going to start seeing very powerful acceleration, not only in revenue but in earnings for this sector,"" said Jonathan Curtis, vice-president of Franklin Equity Group at Franklin Templeton Investments, in ""Tech Sector in the Post Pandemic World"" webinar session today.
""Investors are so positive about this sector right now. Because coming out of this crisis, it (the tech sector) is well positioned to drive very strong growth,"" he said.
Curtis highlighted that the expected exponential growth would materialise in the coming three to five years.
""The Covid-19 [pandemic] has accelerated the opportunity in this space and we think coming out of this current challenge, we are going to see an acceleration in technology investment,"" said Curtis.
In terms of valuation, Curtis said the sector's valuation is reasonable, given its long-term growth potential and high quality of growth.
He believes that the IT sector's valuation is elevated but not excessive, and when compared with valuations of the S&P 500, the tech index is only at an 8% premium currently.
Curtis pointed out that the price-to-earnings multiple on S&P 500 info technology index of 25.01 times currently is nowhere near the level in 1999 to 2000 of over 50 times. ""Thus, we don't think this is a bubble,"" he said.
On the local front, technology stocks can be seen swarming the top gainers list in the recent three months. Bursa Malaysia technology index, from this year's low of 23.81 points in March, has jumped 73.2% to 41.24 points at the time of writing.
The stellar performance of the four FANG stocks has helped fuel the upward trend among Malaysian tech stocks. All three Apple Inc, Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc have just hit a record high on Wall Street.
Alphabet Inc, on the other hand, has rebounded US$400 to US$1,451.86 from the low in March.
Curtis expressed his optimism about the tech sector, saying that its growth ""is going to go on for a long time"" on the back of digital transformation.
""The big opportunity in this space is digital transformation,"" said Curtis, saying that it will be supported by growth drivers such as artificial intelligence, fintech, internet of things, and 5G technology, among many others.
Curtis said the demand and the need to use the technology have really soared during the Covid-19 pandemic.
""We needed to learn how to work from home, educate from home, shop from home, exercise from home, healthcare from home, socialise from home and dine out from home,"" he said, adding that there has been a massive retraining of consumers on how the services work and what it could do, during the lockdown.
Curtis noted that consumers and businesses are going to continue to use these digital services and that retraining will continue not just until a vaccine is broadly administered, but even post the Covid-19 crisis.
Furthermore, he said that the tech sector has a ""very good quality"" being the third-most profitable sector across the S&P 500 by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation margins, adding that it is also one of the few S&P 500 sectors that are net cash positive."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=246","Jun 29, 2020 11:12 AM","MoneyMachineMaker发发发","1）担心其他竞争者的威胁❓
媒体最近报道，中国蓝帆医疗（Blue Sail Medical）和英科医疗（Intco Medical）计划未来3年扩充丁腈手套产能。根据投行研究，蓝帆医疗目标在2023年底提高产能至361亿只；去年底产能为43亿只。而英科医疗计划从目前50亿只增至592亿只。但是其实这两家公司生产的手套有70-80%是 PVC手套, Nitrile gloves 只占了 20-30%
那么面对中国和其他国家来势汹汹的竞争，马来西亚的手套生产商会受到威胁吗？说实话，威胁肯定是存在的。但是，这些竞争者要扩张增产也需要一定的时间和成本。况且医疗手套生产所需的技术是不简单的，并不容易复制。而且我们国家的手套公司一直以来都有来自世界各地固定的顾客，制造手套所需的成本，原料和价格都比较有优势。我们可以换位思考想想，手套公司的长期客户例如医院会随意在价钱和品质都有保证的情况下，去寻找新的卖家吗？而且竞争者会成长，马来西亚身为全球主要手套供应国的老牌公司也会进步，他们也会投入在R&D和Capex用来研发和提升运营效率，使用的科技和技术也不是二三流的。"

最近小编也看到很多人说疫苗面世后手套公司的股价就会完蛋暴跌等的言论。其实，疫苗面世后，手套的需求量就真的会下降吗？在新常态下，很多行业如餐饮，航空，服务业都需要使用手套。在手套的需求只会日益增加的情况下，有的手套公司明年的订单也已经爆满了。那么如果疫苗面世股价就会暴跌的言论是公司的基本面受影响？还是炒作的主题被认为落空了呢？"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=246","Jun 29, 2020 11:13 AM","MoneyMachineMaker发发发","3）政府征收Windfall Tax❓
其实这个消息一直都有在网络流传，而且一直都没被证实。况且，现在手套公司正日夜赶工地为全球生产手套抗疫，可以算是对医疗的一种贡献。假设政府在这时候对它们征收税务，会不会被众人谴责呢？况且即使真的征收，相信手套公司也会把其成本转嫁给消费者。
那么手套公司还有上涨空间❓还值得投资吗❓
___________________________________________
很多手套公司如 Harta,Topglove,Supermax,Kossan,Comfort,Careplus 等在出了业绩后都出现了回调的现象。在这时候，越来越多“负面消息”不断流传出来。但如果仔细思考以上的“负面消息”，它们会影响公司的基本面吗？市场上的人都知道由于手套销售价的增长，手套公司接下来几个季度的业绩都会有爆炸性的成长。如果没有发生突发事件如火烧工厂，手套被其它物品取代，公司未来的业绩如市场预期般地呈现出来，其实个人认为现在的股价并没有算特别地高估。与其询问手套公司可不可以投资，不如反问一下自己现在这样的行情还有什么公司和行业可以稳定做到成长呢？
当然小编不否认在未来手套的销售价格可能会恢复正常水平，但是手套的需求量其实并没有缓下来的理由。手套的需求量是以每年10%左右的速度增长，我们可以看到不止是马来西亚的手套公司正努力地做扩张增加产线，连其他国家如中国也在抓紧这个趋势。可想而知，这个行业的前景和市场需求量是多么地受到青睐。个人认为手套领域是个长期稳定成长的行业，不管是什么公司或行业，公司的股价终究会根据基本面回归应有的价值。至于如何投资就要看自己的资金分配，部署方式还有对行业的认知与了解。"

What the world doesn’t need now is a pandemic on top of a pandemic. So a new finding that Chinese pigs are more and more frequently becoming infected with a strain of influenza that has the potential to jump to humans has infectious disease researchers worldwide taking serious notice. Robert Webster, an influenza investigator who recently retired from St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, says it’s a “guessing game” as to whether this strain will mutate to readily transmit between humans, which it has not done yet. “We just do not know a pandemic is going to occur until the damn thing occurs,” Webster says, noting that China has the largest pig population in the world. “Will this one do it? God knows.”
When multiple strains of influenza viruses infect the same pig, they can easily swap genes, a process known as “reassortment.” The new study, published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, focuses on an influenza virus dubbed G4. The virus is a unique blend of three lineages: one similar to strains found in European and Asian birds, the H1N1 strain that caused the 2009 pandemic, and a North American H1N1 that has genes from avian, human, and pig influenza viruses.
The G4 variant is especially concerning because its core is an avian influenza virus—to which humans have no immunity—with bits of mammalian strains mixed in. “From the data presented, it appears that this is a swine influenza virus that is poised to emerge in humans,” says Edward Holmes, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney who studies pathogens. “Clearly this situation needs to be monitored very closely.”"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=248","Jun 30, 2020 10:17 AM","MoneyMaker168","As part of a project to identify potential pandemic influenza strains, a team led by Liu Jinhua from the China Agricultural University (CAU) analyzed nearly 30,000 nasal swabs taken from pigs at slaughterhouses in 10 Chinese provinces, and another 1000 swabs from pigs with respiratory symptoms seen at their school’s veterinary teaching hospital. The swabs, collected between 2011 and 2018, yielded 179 swine influenza viruses, the vast majority of which were G4 or one of five other G strains from the Eurasian avianlike lineage. “G4 virus has shown a sharp increase since 2016, and is the predominant genotype in circulation in pigs detected across at least 10 provinces,” they write.
Sun Honglei, the paper’s first author, says G4’s inclusion of genes from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic “may promote the virus adaptation” that leads to human-to-human transmission. Therefore, “It’s necessary to strengthen the surveillance” of Chinese pigs for influenza viruses, says Sun, also at CAU."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=248","Jun 30, 2020 10:17 AM","MoneyMaker168","Influenza viruses frequently jump from pigs to humans, but most do not then transmit between humans. Two cases of G4 infections of humans have been documented and both were dead-end infections that did not transmit to other people. “The likelihood that this particular variant is going to cause a pandemic is low,” says Martha Nelson, an evolutionary biologist at the U.S. National Institutes of Health’s Fogarty International Center who studies pig influenza viruses in the United States and their spread to humans. But Nelson notes that no one knew about the pandemic H1N1 strain, which jumped from pigs to people, until the first human cases surfaced in 2009. “Influenza can surprise us,” Nelson says. “And there’s a risk that we neglect influenza and other threats at this time” of COVID-19.
The new study offers but a tiny glimpse into swine influenza strains in China, which has 500 million pigs. While Nelson thinks the predominance of G4 in their analysis is an interesting finding, she says it’s hard to know whether its spread is a growing problem, given the relatively small sample size. “You’re really not getting a good snapshot of what is dominant in pigs in China,” she adds, stressing the need for more sampling in Chinese pigs."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=248","Jun 30, 2020 10:17 AM","MoneyMaker168","In the paper, Sun and colleagues—including George Gao, head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention—describe lab dish studies that show how G4s have become adept at infecting and copying themselves in human airway epithelial cells. The viruses also readily infected and transmitted between ferrets, a popular animal model used to study human influenza. The researchers found antibodies to the G4 strain in 4.4% of 230 people studied in a household survey—and the rate more than doubled in swine workers.
In addition to stepping up surveillance, Sun says it makes sense to develop a vaccine against G4 for both pigs and humans. Webster says at the very least, the seed stock to make a human vaccine—variants of a strain that grow rapidly in the eggs used to make a flu vaccine—should be produced now. “Making the seed stock is not a big deal, and we should have it ready,” Webster says."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=248","Jun 30, 2020 10:18 AM","MoneyMaker168","China rarely uses influenza vaccines in swine. Nelson says U.S. farms commonly do, but the vaccine has little effect because it’s often outdated and doesn’t match circulating strains.
Ideally, Nelson says, we would produce a human G4 vaccine and have it in the stockpile, but that’s an involved process that requires substantial funding. “We need to be vigilant about other infectious disease threats even as COVID is going on because viruses have no interest in whether we’re already having another pandemic,” Nelson says."

Amid a surge in US cases, particularly in the south and west, infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci told Congress earlier Tuesday that things were ""going in the wrong direction,"" and that ""clearly we are not in total control right now.""
He also warned that cases could more than double to 100,000 per day if authorities and the public fail to take steps to suppress the pandemic.
China has accused Trump's administration of politicizing the pandemic to deflect from its own handling of the illness, with the United States suffering by far the highest death count of any country.
US officials, meanwhile, have urged greater transparency from China."

Trump, China the largest population in the world shutdown total lockdown for 70+ days, makes mask wearing mandatory, and implemented all sort of social distancing measures. Infection Cases level stays at 80+k . Recently some cases detected in Beijing, straightaway lockdown again. Chinese all follow the instructions , no such protest protesting mask / the lockdown coz they are too practical abt not dying and keeping everyone safe.
Btw the rest of the world (not US) also did the same....
What did Trump do? He refuse to wear a mask, he push the gov to open the economy too early and he responded to the pandemic way too slow. All countries received the warning at the same time but we the rest of the world are doing better than US. Even Malaysia did so so much better (thank DG and KKM and PM ) . Why ? Coz Trump thinks he is omnipotent and thus he can save US by a flick of his wrist... Too bad he cant and US suffers from his ego."

.PETALING JAYA: Schools will reopen in stages for other students starting July 15.
Education Minister Dr Mohd Radzi Md Jidin (pic) said Forms One to Four students, Years Five and Six pupils, remove class students and Form Six Semester 1 students will return on July 15.
“Years One to Four pupils will return on July 22,” he said during a live telecast today (July 1).
He also said that the academic calendar for 2021 will be decided at a later date.
During the live telecast, he said that because the SPM 2020 examinations will be held in the first week of 2021, the ministry is taking into account the need to reorganise various aspects of logistics for the examinations.
“This includes specifying dates for next year’s school session to ensure it goes well."

Radzi also explained that schools would be submitting their proposal on which of the three models of operation they wish to use to the ministry.
""We will then decide and the model for each school will be made known a week before the schools reopen,"" he said.
Model 1 recommends schools to conduct lessons within one session.
This option is for schools that are able to accommodate all their students and schools that choose this model will operate as usual, he said.
Model 2 recommends a dual session for schools that aren’t able to accommodate all their students in one session, while Model 3 recommends a rotational mode.
He previously said students would have to follow a staggered schedule, which will be announced at a later date."

Earlier on June 24, a total of 500,440 Form Five, Form Six, Sijil Vokasional Malaysia and Sijil Tinggi Agama students from 2,440 schools and hundreds of international schools returned to schools after more than three months."

He said the process would be carried out in two phases.

New Zealand's health minister has resigned after criticism of the government's response to coronavirus and his own breaches of lockdown rules.
David Clark had already been demoted after breaking rules to take his family to the beach.
He said continuing in his role was distracting from the government's overall response to the pandemic.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern confirmed on Thursday that she had accepted his resignation."

The country has recorded 1,528 confirmed or probable coronavirus cases and 22 people have died. Last month, all Covid-19 restrictions were lifted and the nation was declared virus free.
However the country's handling of border and isolation facilities has recently come under fire. In one case, two people were allowed to leave isolation early to visit a dying parent without being tested for the virus. They were later confirmed to have Covid-19."

Mr Clark said: ""I take full responsibility for decisions made and taken during my time as Minister of Health.""
He said that now was the appropriate time to move on, with no evidence of community transmission in the country.
Mr Clark was already under pressure following several breaches of lockdown rules. In April, he was demoted after driving his family 20km (12 miles) to the beach during the first weekend of lockdown.
He also went mountain biking during the lockdown, however this was not as clear a breach of the rules as driving to the beach, the New Zealand Herald said.
He previously offered his resignation but was kept in his role because of the ongoing crisis."

In a second study area, which covered 170 miles on Alaska's Baldwin Peninsula, the number of dams jumped from 94 in 2010 to 409 in 2019.

Titanic swarms of desert locusts resembling dark storm clouds are descending ravenously on the Horn of Africa. They're roving through croplands and flattening farms in a devastating salvo experts are calling an unprecedented threat to food security. On the ground, subsistence planters can do nothing but watch — staring up with horror and at their fields in dismay.
Locusts have been around since at least the time of the pharaohs of ancient Egypt, 3200 B.C., despoiling some of the world's weakest regions, multiplying to billions and then vanishing, in irregular booms and busts."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=255","Jul 6, 2020 10:40 AM","SunnyWong","If the 2020 version of these marauders stays steady on its warpath, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization says desert locusts can pose a threat to the livelihoods of 10% of the world's population.
The peril may already be underway: Early June projections by the FAO are forecasting a second generation of spring-bred locusts in Eastern Africa, giving rise to new, powerful swarms of locust babies capable of wreaking havoc until mid-July or beyond.
Here are five things you need to know about locusts to understand the current crisis and why the tiny invaders are such a big deal."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=255","Jul 6, 2020 10:41 AM","SunnyWong","1. What is a locust?
There can be a lot of confusion about what exactly a locust is. To the average eye, it's easy to mix up the critters with cicadas and crickets. The simple answer, though, explains Rick Overson of Arizona State University's Global Locust Initiative, is that locusts are a very special kind of grasshopper."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=255","Jul 6, 2020 10:41 AM","SunnyWong","As Overson explains, there are hundreds of species of grasshoppers, ""but only a small handful of those are what we consider locusts.""
That raises a question: What makes a locust a locust? According to Overson, it comes down to a superpower possessed by locusts that enables them to go through a remarkable switch in development.
Most of the time, locusts exist in their ""grasshopper phase"" — they lead solitary lives, they're green and pretty unremarkable.
""Nobody really notices them,"" Overson says."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=255","Jul 6, 2020 10:41 AM","SunnyWong","The timing of this varies, and the shifts are pretty irregular, but for years, locusts can live like this – alone, biding their time.
But when environmental conditions are right — usually when there's a lot of rainfall and moisture — something dramatic happens: ""They increase in numbers, and as they do so, they sense one another around them,"" says Overson.
This is what biologists call the ""gregarious phase"" of the locust.
The creatures undergo a remarkable transformation. ""They change their physiology. Their brain changes, their coloration changes, their body size changes,"" Overson says. ""Instead of repelling one another, they become attracted to one another — and if those conditions persist in the environment, they start to march together in coordinated formations across the landscape, which is what we're seeing in eastern Africa."""
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=255","Jul 6, 2020 10:41 AM","SunnyWong","The ability to change dramatically like this in response to environmental conditions is called phenotypic plasticity. Many species, such as some types of coral, exhibit it. Though scientists can't be certain why locusts developed the trait over time, many believe it's because they typically live in temperamental and harsh environments.
""Locusts tend to live in areas where resources that they need are very unpredictable,"" Overson explains. The Horn of Africa, for instance, is known for being arid, going for years without heavy rain until slammed suddenly by powerful downfalls. ""The strongest hypothesis is that these crazy, unpredictable dynamics select evolutionarily for this ability to go through these dramatic changes, to respond when you can capitalize on a rare opportunity and also have capacity to migrate.""
When locusts swarm like this, they ravage agriculture, devouring practically anything in sight.
Though they have teeth, locusts don't bite humans. (Unless you, you know, jammed a finger into its mandible; it would maybe bite you then, Overson says.)"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=255","Jul 6, 2020 10:41 AM","SunnyWong","2. Where are the locusts swarming, and how big are the swarms?
Swarms are most intense in East African countries, including Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia, but data from the FAO's Desert Locust Watch documents steadily worsening infestations across Southwest Asia and the Middle East. Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Uganda and Iran are among those afflicted.
""In Kenya, it's the worst outbreak they've had to face in the last 70 years,"" says Keith Cressman, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization's senior locust forecasting officer. ""In India or Pakistan, it's probably the worst they've had to face in the last quarter of a century."""
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=255","Jul 6, 2020 10:41 AM","SunnyWong","The swarms are gargantuan masses of tens of billions of flying bugs. They range anywhere from a square third of a mile to 100 square miles or more, with 40 million to 80 million locusts packed in half a square mile. They bulldoze pasturelands in dark clouds the size of football fields and small cities. In northern Kenya, Cressman says, one swarm was reported to be 25 miles long by 37 miles wide — it would blanket the city of Paris 24 times over.
Experts say the upsurge is likely to be tied to extreme weather events: According to Cressman, powerful cyclones in 2018 dumped water in Oman, Yemen and the Horn of Africa. The wet conditions have persisted, creating ideal bug breeding conditions."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=255","Jul 6, 2020 10:41 AM","SunnyWong","Once they enter the gregarious phase, a generation of locusts can multiply twentyfold every three months. So when they boom, they do so exponentially, and things quickly get out of hand."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=255","Jul 6, 2020 10:42 AM","SunnyWong","3. How far can locusts travel?
Locusts are migratory, transboundary pests. They ride the winds, crisscrossing swaths of land until they find something they want to munch on. They especially love cereal grain crops, planted extensively across Africa.
""They are powerful, long-distance flyers, so they can easily go a hundred plus kilometers in a 24-hour period,"" Overson notes. ""They can easily move across countries in a matter of days, which is one of the other major challenges in coordinated efforts that are required between nations and institutions to manage them.""
In 1988, swarms originating in North Africa crossed the Atlantic Ocean and made it successfully to the Caribbean and South America. Even today, they routinely traverse the Red Sea — a distance of 186 miles. Projections show that current locust populations are poised to spread ""all the way from eastern to western Africa by June or July,"" Overson says. ""There's major concerns there."""
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=255","Jul 6, 2020 10:42 AM","SunnyWong","4. How do locusts affect food security?
Locusts are ravenous eaters. An adult desert locust that weighs about 2 grams (a fraction of an ounce) can consume roughly its own weight daily. And they're not picky at all. According to the FAO, a swarm of just 1 square kilometer — again, about a third of a square mile — can consume as much food as would be eaten by 35,000 people (or six elephants) in a single day.
""When they do descend, they can have almost total devastation,"" Overson says. ""They can cause 50 to 80% of crops to be destroyed, depending on the time [of year].""
The last large locust outbreak, which started in 2003 and lasted until 2005, resulted in an estimated $2.5 billion in crop damage. Studies found that the economic effect was largely felt by subsistence farmers. Children who grew up during the period were much less likely to go to school, and girls were disproportionately affected.
Making matters worse, many of the countries slammed with the worst infestations are already hobbling from protracted crises — recovering from recessions, fighting natural disasters, racked by conflict and now the coronavirus outbreak.
""We're talking about a corner of Africa that's really, really vulnerable,"" Cressman says. ""They've had successive years of drought, and then this year, they've had heavy rains and floods. So even without the locusts, they're already in a precarious situation.""
Now, Cressman says the potential hunger threat is tremendous in a region where 42 million were already slated to face acute food insecurity.
""The locusts are in your field for a morning, and by midday, there's hardly anything left in your field,"" he says. ""It's just eaten."""
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=255","Jul 6, 2020 10:42 AM","SunnyWong","5. How are countries fighting locusts?
There's a slate of international institutions that coordinates locust management and response. The primary effort is conducted by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, which runs the Desert Locust Watch to surveil and track locust migration patterns and oversee regional response efforts."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=255","Jul 6, 2020 10:42 AM","SunnyWong","In individual nations, a lack of cash, competing priorities and domestic challenges make it hard to mount a long-range pest management strategy. Because locust numbers ebb and flow, Overson says it's been difficult for countries — such as Kenya, which hasn't seen an infestation in 70 years — to build up intermediate and long-term infrastructure to address outbreaks proactively. That's why so many governments are now scrambling to come up with solutions.
""It's hard to maintain funding and political will and knowledge and capacity building when you have these unpredictable boom and bust cycles that could play out over years or decades,"" he says. ""The drama and spectacle of the outbreak right now is important to cover, but the more nuanced narrative involves the slow, ratchet method of building infrastructure: If you wait until it's reactive and forget about it until it happens again, we're going to be in this situation forever.""
Right now, the most effective way to fight outbreaks involves mass aerial sprays of pesticides to kill locusts. Overson says that's not ideal, given the adverse effect such chemicals have on biodiversity and human health."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=255","Jul 6, 2020 10:42 AM","SunnyWong","But emerging technologies may hold promise for the future. For example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently partnered with the United Nations to repurpose technology used to track smoke plumes from fires to predict the migrations of locusts, the Scientific American reported. And in terms of locust extermination, Overson says biopesticides have untapped potential — although lots of research and development is still needed in the area.
Considering all of the other worldwide emergencies that have hit in 2020, aid resources are stretched thin. Pesticide deliveries have been delayed. But Cressman is hopeful that the needed funds will materialize. The FAO has already raised half of the $300 million it expects to need for this effort.

Experts say Malaysia can do better in how it measures how many Malaysians are officially considered poor by using higher benchmarks to match its current status as an upper middle-income nation.
When it comes to measuring poverty levels in Malaysia, the government currently uses two methods: Poverty Line Income (PLI) and the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI).
The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently said the PLI — which is used to measure “absolute poverty” — is based on a household’s basic requirements to live healthily and actively.
Malaysia currently uses a PLI level of RM980 nationally, and at a higher level of RM1,020 for Sarawak and RM1,180 for Sabah (to factor in additional costs such as transportation costs), the ministry had said. (The RM980 monthly PLI would translate to slightly above RM8 per person daily based on a household of four.)
(In 2014, the PLI was RM930 for Peninsular Malaysia, RM990 for Sarawak and RM1,170 for Sabah.)
Households with monthly incomes below the PLI level are considered poor, which means there are officially 24,700 households (or a mere 0.4 per cent of total households) in Malaysia that are categorised as poor as of 2016.
Experts have said however that the PLI needs to be raised to present a more accurate indication of the poverty levels in Malaysia.
Jeffrey Sachs Centre on Sustainable Development research associate Derek Kok said Malaysia is currently an upper middle-income country and should at least set its benchmarks against other countries in the same income bracket, and not use lower-income countries as the benchmark.
“A lot of the government’s welfare and social assistance policies now already focus on B40 instead of just those below the defined poverty line — this is an implicit admittance that the poverty line is too low,” he told Malay Mail.
World Bank senior economist Kenneth Simler said the current PLI of US$1.90 (RM7.97) per person per day — under the World Bank’s standard for extreme poverty and United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) — is not suited as reference for Malaysia’s PLI benchmark, which should be higher.
“So for SDG purposes, Malaysia uses that, that’s appropriate across all countries in the world for extreme poverty. But it’s not really the PLI you want to use for developing domestic policies here,”"

Philip Alston, who previously made headlines for suggesting that actual poverty is much higher than the national 0.4 percent rate, said his current view is based on PN's response to the final report of findings from his trip to Malaysia last August."

Just inform the B40 Malays that the Chinese are causing the poverty that they are suffering from and PN is trying to rectify the issue like what UMNO has been doing for the last few eons before PH came to power. In short, PN needs to make the Chinese poor and automatically the Malays will become rich. As for the non Malay B40's, well the have learned not to rely on the gov't for help so they will not disturb the gov't for help. Simple! Poverty problem settled."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=256","Jul 6, 2020 11:52 AM","WellingtonSky","Yeah guys, It's such an oxymoron predicament trying to address poverty in the current political standoff. A race and religion based political, social and economic hegemony, promoted by PN ( and by Mahathir) versus an integrated citizenry based policies, that PH, a government elected by people, pursued albeit without diminishing the special privileges of the Bumiputras.
Science is politicians enemy, since science relies on facts, hypothesis and field results to make its points and which must be peer reviewed. Politicians don't like any of this.
Thus U.N. approach in measuring poverty in Malaysia and the recommendations thereof will not augment with PN, a backdoor government, who does not represent the will of the citizenry but rather a political establishment that manipulates race and religion to gain political dominance against minorities.
In the prevailing toxic and devisive political environment, poverty is defined relatively against citizens' colour and creed.
While the citizens world over, in as many ways trying to find a just world for all, Malaysia under PN, is moving backward into a tribal culture, where fear against unknown creates unity."

「港版國安法」引爆激烈政治角力，英國首相約翰遜及外相藍韜文多次提到中方若繼續立法，便會考慮擴大持BNO的港人權利，最終獲得居留權機會。有政界消息指，英國一旦落實相關措施，中央或會出招反制，包括取消BNO持有人的中國國籍、香港居留權及投票權。
政界消息認為，英國政府在香港民主問題上指手畫腳，如果英政府最終決定BNO護照持有人是英國公民，不排除中央會作出回應，包括宣布接受英國政府單方面安排的港人，會自動喪失中國國籍和香港居留權，有關港人的投票權亦可能被取消。"

《港區國安法第43條實施細則》明日(7日)生效。有時事評論員及議員均認為，實施細則對《港區國安法》提及的四大罪行具有明顯針對性，相信實施後有助進一步維護國家安全，執法上更具效率。
時事評論員陳雲生認為，新法例賦予特首權力批准截取通訊，於打擊危害國家安全的行為上更加有效率及更加保密，亦可有助警方迅速執法，「如果好似以前咁要法庭批，一來要花時間開庭處理，亦要交資料俾法庭，過程中有可能外洩。」
陳雲生又指，6年前的非法佔中事件，以及去年反修例黑暴，幕後均有人提供政治黑金來支援操作，而且過去一年明顯有人在網上指揮及策劃黑暴的破壞活動，認為新法例賦權刪除網上言論，可針對打擊所謂「去大台化」的策劃行為；而要求外國組織交代資金來源，則可打擊政治黑金禍港。
議員葛珮帆認為，《實施細則》能令維護國家安全行動更有效率。她舉例指，警務處處長可在保安局局長批准下，向外國及台灣政治性組織及其代理人要求就涉港活動提供資料；認為過往「冇咩方法郁到佢哋」，如今細則有助遏止有外國組織在港支持恐怖活動情況。"

英國外相藍韜文周一在國會下議院宣布，對俄羅斯、沙特阿拉伯、北韓和緬甸的個人和組織實施經濟制裁。跨黨派議員質疑為何制裁名單不包括香港及新疆官員，保守黨議員施志安點名提出應制裁香港行政長官林鄭月娥。藍韜文稱會基於證據仔細考慮，正處理第二批制裁名單。
英國首次根據《馬格尼茨基修正案》，制裁49個個人或組織，該法授權英國政府禁止受制裁者入境英國、通過英國銀行進行資金轉移或從英國經濟中獲利，並允許當局凍結受制裁者的個人資產。
施志安問到名單為何沒有涵蓋香港或新疆官員，他問英方是否準備好無論對象是誰及他們的地位，「即使意味從林鄭月娥開始（制裁）」，又稱知道林鄭的家人享有英國護照特權。工黨議員布賴恩特（Chris Bryant）亦強烈敦促藍韜文考慮另一項包括鎮壓民主、集會和言論自由權利的條款，非常仔細地考慮林鄭應不應列入榜單。藍韜文沒有排除制裁林鄭的可能，稱會非常仔細地考慮，強調當局正制訂第二批制裁名單。
藍韜文透露，他將再與五眼聯盟的外長通電話，討論協調未來的制裁對象。據指，澳洲考慮類似的立法，美國則制訂了有250個個人及實體的制裁清單，加拿大則有70個制裁對象。
美國國務卿蓬佩奧歡迎英方的行動，華府將繼續尋求額外盟友及夥伴共同利用所有手段，禁止所有嚴重侵犯人權的對象進入美國及國際金融系統。
英國今次的制裁名單包括被指參與殺害沙特異見記者卡舒吉行動的沙特情報高級官員、導致俄羅斯稅務顧問馬格尼茨基（Sergei Magnitsky）死亡的俄國官員、北韓國家保衞省和人民保安部等。緬甸國防軍總司令敏昂萊（Min Aung Hlaing）和副總司令梭溫（Soe Win）被指策劃針對羅興亞人的屠殺行動，亦受到制裁。藍韜文強調，制裁目標是一些近年臭名昭著的侵犯人權人士。
俄羅斯駐倫敦大使館說，不能接受俄羅斯聯邦調查委員會主席及一些法官被列入制裁名單，強調俄方保留回應的權利。"

《港區國安法》上周二晚實施，港府昨刊憲公布「第四十三條實施細則」，並於今日生效。細則中列明警隊國安處偵辦危害國家安全犯罪案件時，可採取的七項執法措施，其中較受注目的是，警方若懷疑有人在電子平台上發布的電子訊息可能危害國家安全，可要求有關發布人士或網絡服務商等移除訊息。另為有效防止和偵測危害國安罪行及保護涉及國安資料的機密性，所有截取通訊及秘密監察行動的申請，改須經行政長官批准，毋須如其他案件般要法官批准。
最新公布的警方七項執法細則中，有三項較過去為新，其中警方在處理危害國安的訊息時，除可要求網絡服務商等移除訊息，又提到若有關的訊息發布人未即時合作，而資訊繼續在網上嚴重影響公眾，警方可向裁判官申請手令檢取有關電子器材並移除訊息，亦可申請手令要求有關服務商提供有關身份紀錄或解密協助。
為有效防止和偵測危害國安罪行及保護涉及國安資料的機密性，所有截取通訊及秘密監察行動的申請，須經行政長官批准；而進行侵擾程度較低的秘密監察行動，可向行政長官指定的首長級警務處人員申請許可。港區國安法生效前，《基本法》第卅條訂明，香港居民的通訊自由和通訊秘密受法律保護，執法機關在展開任何截取通訊或秘密監察前，必須先取得既定的小組法官或指定授權人員的授權。
此外，警方如合理地相信為防止及偵查危害國安罪行所需要，可在保安局局長批准下，向某外國政治性組織或台灣政治組織，或某外國代理人或台灣代理人等，送達書面通知，規定組織或代理人在指定期限及方式，向警方提交包括個人資料、資產、收入來源等。
其餘四項措施則涵蓋多個範疇，搜證方面，警員倘偵查關於危害國安的罪行，可向裁判官申請手令進入和搜查有關地方，在緊急情況下，更可憑助理處長級或以上警務人員的授權，在無手令的情況下入內搜證。警方為偵查干犯相關罪行而獲得的得益，律政司司長或警方可向法庭申請批准，要求有關人士在指定時限內答問題，或交出相關資料。
為免部分涉案人士潛逃海外，警員可向裁判官申請手令，要求懷疑干犯相關罪行而受查的人交出旅行證件並限制離港。在凍結及充公與危害國安罪行相關的財產，保安局局長懷疑某財產是危害國安所涉財產，可藉書面通知作出指示，任何人不得處理該財產，而原訟法庭可在律政司司長的申請下，命令將罪行相關財產充公。
政府發言人指出，相關措施既能達到防範、制止和懲治危害國家安全行為和活動的目的，也能同時符合港區國安法總則下對尊重和保障人權以及依法保護各項權利和自由的要求。
議員葛珮帆認為，細則對港區國安法提及的四大罪行具明顯針對性，有助進一步維護國家安全及執法效率，如警務處處長可在保安局局長批准下，要求外國及台灣政治性組織及其代理人提供涉港活動資料，過往「冇咩方法郁到佢哋」，如今有助遏止外國組織在港支持恐怖活動。
時事評論員陳雲生則認為，新法例賦特首權力批准截取通訊，更有效率及更保密打擊危害國家安全行為，亦有助警方迅速執法及防洩密。六年前非法佔中及去年黑暴行動，幕後均有人提供政治黑金支援，過去一年明顯有人網上指揮及策劃黑暴破壞，新法例賦權刪除網上言論，針對打擊所謂「去大台化」的策劃行為，而要求外國組織交代資金來源，能打擊政治黑金禍港。"

《港區國安法第43條實施細則》今日(6日)刊憲及將於明日(7日)生效。其中列明警方可在合理懷疑下，要求發布人士移除危害國安信息；警方在必要情況時，可在特首批准下截取通訊，毋須如其他案件般要法官批准。在特殊情況下，助理處長級以上警務人員可授權無手令下進入有關地方搜證等。
《港區國安法》第43條規定，警務處維護國家安全部門辦理危害國家安全犯罪案件時可以採取的各種措施。今日稍早時間，香港國安委舉行成立後首次會議，全體成員均有出席，國家安全事務顧問駱惠寧亦列席會議，會上制訂了使用第43條所規定措施的相關實施細則。
實施細則詳情如下：
1. 為搜證而搜查有關地方
有關細則參照多條現行法例中有關特殊情況下容許緊急搜查的條文，包括《火器及彈藥條例》（第238章）及《進出口條例》（第60章）等。為偵查危害國家安全罪行，警務人員可向裁判官申請手令進入和搜查有關地方進行搜證。在特殊情況（如緊急情況）下，助理處長級或以上警務人員可授權其人員在無手令的情況下，進入有關地方搜證。
2. 限制受調查的人離開香港
參照現行《防止賄賂條例》（第201章）限制受調查人離境的條文，細則授權警務人員可向裁判官申請手令，要求懷疑犯了該等危害國家安全罪行而受調查的人交出旅行證件，並限制其離開香港，以免部分涉案人士潛逃海外。交出旅行證件的人，可以書面向警務處處長或裁判官申請發還該旅行證件及批准離開香港。
3. 凍結、限制、沒收及充公與危害國家安全罪行相關財產
有關安排參考現行《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》（第455章）及《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》（第575章）相關權力和規定。保安局局長如有合理理由懷疑某財產是危害國家安全罪行相關財產，可藉書面通知作出指示，任何人不得處理該財產。而原訟法庭可在律政司司長的申請下，命令將罪行相關財產充公。任何人如知悉或懷疑任何財產是危害國家安全罪行相關財產，亦有責任在切實可行的情況下盡快向警方披露，以及不得向另一人披露任何相當可能損害或會因應上述的披露而進行的任何調查的資料。律政司司長亦可向原訟法庭申請限制令或押記令，禁止任何人處理任何可變現財產，或指明可變現財產作為押記以擔保向政府繳付款項的命令，並可向法庭申請沒收危害國家安全罪行的犯罪得益，命令在訂定期間內妥為繳付追討款額。
4. 移除危害國家安全的信息及要求協助
如警務處處長有合理理由懷疑在電子平台上發布的電子信息相當可能構成危害國家安全罪行或相當可能會導致危害國家安全罪行的發生，可在保安局局長批准下，授權指定的警務處人員要求有關發布人士、平台服務商、主機服務商及／或網路服務商移除危害國家安全的信息；限制或停止任何人接達該信息；或限制或停止任何人接達該平台或相關部分。但若所需的科技並非發布者或有關服務商合理可得，或有關服務商遵從有關要求有對第三方招致相當程度損失或損害第三方的權利的風險存在，則可為合理辯解。
若有關的信息發布人未即時合作，而有關資訊會繼續在網上嚴重影響公眾，警務人員可向裁判官申請手令檢取有關電子器材，並作出行動盡快移除該信息。有關人員亦可在指定情況向裁判官申請發出手令，授權警務人員，要求有關服務商按情況所需提供有關身份紀錄或解密協助。
5. 向外國及台灣政治性組織及其代理人要求就涉港活動提供資料
警務處處長如合理地相信是防止及偵查危害國家安全罪行所需要的，可在保安局局長批准下，藉向某外國政治性組織或台灣政治性組織，或某外國代理人或台灣代理人，送達書面通知，規定該組織或代理人在指定期限內，按指定方式向警務處處長提交指明資料（包括在香港的活動及個人資料、資產、收入、收入來源及開支）。此細則參考了現有《社團條例》（第151章），社團事務主任可要求社團提供資料的條文。
6. 進行截取通訊及秘密監察的授權申請
為有效防止和偵測危害國家安全罪行及保護涉及國家安全的資料的機密性，所有截取通訊及秘密監察行動的申請，須經行政長官批准；而進行侵擾程度較低的秘密監察行動，可向行政長官指定的首長級警務處人員申請。授權當局須確定秘密行動能符合「相稱性」和「必要性」的驗證標準，方可作出授權。根據《國安法》第四十三條，國安委對警務處採取規定的措施負有監督責任，而根據實行細則，行政長官可委任一名獨立人士，協助國安委履行上述的監督責任。此外，保安局局長亦發出《運作原則及指引》，為警務人員如何作出有關申請及行使權力提供運作原則及指引，規定警務處人員在執行有關職能時須予遵守。有關《運作原則及指引》會與《實施細則》同時刊憲。
7. 提供資料和提交物料
為協助偵查危害國家安全罪行，或干犯有關罪行而獲得的得益，律政司司長或警務人員可向法庭申請批准，要求有關人士在指定時限內回答問題，或提供或交出相關資料或物料。有關條文，參考現行《有組織及嚴重罪行條例》（第455章）及《聯合國（反恐怖主義措施）條例》（第575章）相關權力和規定。"

梁稱，去年區選的參選要求太過寬鬆，她多次向政府投訴，並要求政府向選舉主任發出清晰條文或指引，讓選舉主任可以遵從。她大鬧政府不單沒有頒布指引，甚至將責任推卸給選舉主任。她又認為，選舉主任都有自己的意識形態，但現時《港區國安法》已公布及實施，選舉主任就要參考相關法律。
至於反對港區國安法會否遭到DQ？梁美芬認為要一併考慮其他情況和因素，舉例指本身爭取「35+」議席這個想法無問題，但如果爭取「35+」的目的是想癱瘓政府、立法會、揚言否決政府所有法案及財政預算案，從而迫使政府答應訴求而「搞彎」香港，則可能會違反港區國安法。"

University officials scrambled Monday to adapt to new federal guidance that does not allow international students to stay in the country if they are taking classes online only. It also left some students expressing fears on social media that they risked being suddenly deported.
“Our institutions right now are struggling to figure out what the fall is going to look like, how best to serve their students, while keeping everybody safe,” said Sarah Spreitzer, director of government relations for the American Council on Education. “This is just going to make things more complicated. ”
When universities rapidly shut down this spring in response to the coronavirus pandemic — many in response to governors’ orders — federal agencies granted flexibility to existing requirements that international students must take classes in person. The major associations of universities had asked federal officials to extend that flexibility into the fall, as the continued spread of the disease has led many schools to offer classes online only in an effort to prevent further spread of the disease."

University leaders have many questions, including what this might mean for graduate students, several people said.
“If their labs close and they’re not able to work full time on dissertation research … do they have to leave the country?” Boroughs asked. “We know there are many PhD candidates who are involved in critical research to respond to this covid pandemic. ”
Monday’s announcement requires universities to certify by July 15 whether they will be fully open, operate on a hybrid model or offer online-only classes."

Spreitzer said it appeared that schools that jumped to online-only courses in the fall because of a surge in infections would put their international students in jeopardy. She wondered whether the announcement would lead schools to alter their plans.
The University of Southern California dramatically revised its fall semester plans last week amid an “alarming spike” in cases in the region and intensified restrictions from the governor, recommending undergraduates take all classes online and reconsider living on or near campus.

“There is a global competition for the best and brightest students, and the United States continues to lose ground in this competition.” One reason for that, he said, is the policy and messaging of the federal government. “That needs to be addressed.”"

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=259","Jul 8, 2020 10:20 AM","SunnyWong","(Bloomberg) -- Malaysia’s central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the lowest on record and warned of lingering downside risks to a economy reopening after months of lockdown against coronavirus.
The overnight policy rate was reduced to 1.75%, the lowest in records dating back to 2004, as 14 of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted. Four had forecast a 50 basis-point cut, while seven expected no change.
The rate cut “provides additional policy stimulus to accelerate the pace of economic recovery,” the central bank said in a statement. Policy makers “will continue to assess evolving conditions and their implications on the overall outlook for inflation and domestic growth.”
Bank Negara Malaysia’s fourth straight rate cut comes hours after the finance minister alluded to fiscal and monetary policy space to continue supporting the economy amid three straight months of deflation and the worst unemployment in decades. The economy began reopening May 4 after a lockdown to contain the pandemic shuttered businesses and left nearly a million people jobless.
Downside Risks
Recent indicators show activity picking up, but the pace and strength of recovery “remain subject to downside risks emanating from both domestic and external factors,” the central bank said. Risks include persistent weakness in the labor market and a tepid global recovery.
“The statement is dovish enough to expect more rate cuts but cautious enough to manage expectations, as it mentions economic recovery,” said Trinh Nguyen, a senior economist at Natixis SA in Hong Kong. “That means that we likely will have another 25 basis-point cut but not much more, as the ringgit remains weak.”
Benchmark three-year government bonds extended gains after the decision, with yields falling seven basis points to 2.09% as of 4:37 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur. The ringgit held the bulk of its gains, rising 0.1% to 4.2760 per dollar.
Malaysia’s chief statistician, Mohd Uzir Mahidin, has warned the economy is headed for recession. The government has announced 295 billion ringgit ($69 billion) in stimulus to cushion the effects of the pandemic, and is drafting a bill of economic recovery measures.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say:
“Bank Negara Malaysia may pause its easing cycle for the remainder of 3Q, taking stock of its 125 bps of rate cuts and other measures so far this year, alongside nascent signs of recovery. Even so, the central bank sounds wary of prolonged economic weakness amid a highly uncertain recovery track. We expect another 25 bps rate cut in 4Q.”

Consumer prices have been declining since March, dropping by a record-low 2.9% in both April and May on the back of falling transport costs. Bank Negara Malaysia, which previously forecast inflation in a range of -1.5% to 0.5% this year, said Tuesday full-year inflation is likely to be negative.
The central bank also warned of the potential for further virus outbreaks that might force authorities to restrict movement again. Tuesday’s decision came hours after a six-week lockdown was imposed in Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest city, amid a fresh coronavirus outbreak, and as U.S. states consider tightening restrictions again amid a resurgence of cases.
Monetary Policy Committee members “remain guarded as to what the future may hold,” said Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid, chief economist at Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd. “The key message from the MPC is that BNM will go the extra mile in terms of monetary policy accommodation.”"

美國國務院和聯合國週二 (7 日) 表示，川普政府已正式致函聯合國秘書長古特瑞斯 (Antonio Guterres)，宣布美國正式退出世界衛生組織 (WHO)，並於 2021 年 7 月 6 日起生效。
聯合國秘書長發言人杜加里克 (Stéphane Dujarric) 週二提到，川普政府週一向秘書長古特瑞斯寄出退出 WHO 通知，美國將在一年內退出世衛。美國國務院受訪時稱，美國將繼續尋求對 WHO 的改革。
美聯邦參議院外交委員會主席孟南德茲 (Robert Menendez) 週二透露，美國國會已收到通知，在疫情大流行之際，川普總統已正式讓美國退出 WHO。
美國向來是 WHO 最大資助國，每年提供 4 億至 5 億美元的強制性和自願捐款，目前美國還欠世衛組織約 2 億美元的當期和過往會費。根據退出條款，美國必須先履行對 WHO 財務義務，然後才能正式確定退出。
美國總統川普 5 月 29 日宣布，美國將退出 WHO，理由是世衛未能在 30 天之內做出實質性的重大改革，美國將永久性的撤出資金。
川普曾多次指控世衛搞砸防疫，而且立場卻偏袒中國，忽視新冠病毒 (COVID-19) 疫情的種種警告訊號，造成了世界極大的損失。
美國前副總統、民主黨參選人的拜登曾表示，他支持世衛組織，並於週二承諾，如果他在 11 月美國總選大選擊敗川普，美國將重新加入 WHO。
拜登稱：「當美國致力於強化全球健康體系時，美國人民才會更安全，若我當選，我將在就任首日讓美國重返 WHO，並恢復我們在世界舞台上的領導地位。」"

The United States House Foreign Affairs Committee's Interim Report on Origins of COVID-19 Pandemic
15Jun2020
The CCP repeatedly, and intentionally, violated the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR).
The WHO appears to have repeatedly violated their own IHR and their obligations to Member States.
The CCP had sufficient information to warrant a full scale public health response as early as mid-December, 2019.
Xi and senior CCP leaders knew a pandemic was occurring weeks before they implemented a lockdown in Wuhan.
The CCP's cover-up of the coronavirus played a significant role in turning what could have been a local epidemic into a global pandemic.
The WHO/Tedros only exacerbated the problem by repeatedly ignoring warnings about the severity of the virus, while at the same time parroting the CCP’s propaganda without independently confirming their claims.
This was a failure of monumental proportions and it is imperative that we uncover the truth so we can set up future safeguards to prevent this from happening yet again.
To date, the CCP has refused to provide the international community with lab samples, accurate case data, and access to sites of interest around Wuhan, PRC.
The CCP cover-up means it is unlikely that we will be able to identify the source of the outbreak.
Had the CCP instituted a full scale, public response in early February, up to 95% of cases in the PRC at the end of February could have been prevented.
In sum, the COVID-19 global pandemic could have been prevented if the CCP acted in a transparent and responsible manner."

The United States said Tuesday it was restricting visas to Chinese officials over Tibet, renewing a call for ""meaningful autonomy"" in the predominantly Buddhist region.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was taking action against an unspecified number of officials under a new US law that presses China to let Americans visit Tibet.
""Unfortunately, Beijing has continued systematically to obstruct travel to the Tibetan Autonomous Region and other Tibetan areas by US diplomats and other officials, journalists and tourists, while PRC officials and other citizens enjoy far greater access to the United States,"" Pompeo said in a statement.
Pompeo restricted visas to Chinese officials determined to be ""substantially involved"" in the exclusion of foreigners from Tibetan areas.
The State Department declined to name the officials or say how many people were affected, citing US confidentiality laws.
Amid high tension with China, the United States has increasingly been issuing such visa sanctions, earlier taking action over Beijing's clampdown on free expression in Hong Kong and its ongoing incarceration of some one million Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims.
The Tibet action comes under a 2018 law passed by Congress that aims to pressure China over its tight restrictions in the Himalayan region.
Human rights groups say that Tibetans live under strict surveillance with the threat of jail or abuse for any signs of a non-Chinese identity, including possessing images of the Dalai Lama, their exiled spiritual leader."

A British MP has also introduced similar legislation.

“This has really blown up in such a (bad) way. My role is really just to amplify and dignify the voices of the most vulnerable communities,” she said.
“Even during the movement control order (MCO), we have been feeding over 50,000 people regardless of their status. How was it that trying to do good can end up with us getting into trouble?”
“We are fully heartbroken with the police action but as an activist, I continue standing by my convictions and amplifying the voices of the most vulnerable,” added Quah, who also said that her handphone had been confiscated, giving the police access to all her social media channels.
“This incident makes me question – what is freedom of speech?” she said.
Quah’s lawyer New Sin Yew confirmed that she is being investigated under the Penal Code 500 for criminal defamation and Section 233 of the Communications and Multimedia Act (CMA) 1998 for the improper use of network facilities or network service."

It wasn’t that clear which post was it as the police did not specify, but we know that it’s probably related to the treatment of detainees in the immigration detention centre,” New explained.
New added that this latest investigation was similar to a number of recent investigations involving activists or those who speak out.
“This shouldn’t happen. Everyone is just trying to highlight certain issues which could be done better,” he said.
Regarding the confiscation of Quah’s phone, New said it was a normal practice.
“They normally do this as part of their investigation but the way we see it is that it is a form of harassment when there is no offence being committed,” he said.
Earlier last month, Quah shared her experience in helping a woman who struggled to care for her baby at the detention centre.
Her writing also exposed allegedly horrific conditions of the immigration detention cells.
Quah’s Facebook post on the issue had earned her a barrage of hate comments and harassments, including threats to her safety.
Her questioning today came in the wake of a police probe on an Al Jazeera news documentary episode that allegedly misrepresented facts surrounding the treatment of migrants detained around Covid-19 red zones in Kuala Lumpur."

“I urge (Communications and Multimedia Minister) Saifuddin Abdullah to act swiftly to assure reporters, editors and other media personnel that the government of the day is not anti-media or anti-freedom of speech, as well as give its commitment to immediately cease acts pressuring the media,” Fahmi said in the statement, uploaded on Facebook.
He also urged Saifuddin (below) to push forward with the media council, which formation remained uncertain with the installation of the new federal government.
This would allow issues surrounding the press to be systematically worked on, without affecting the perception held by international media and without turning local media into the government’s “yes men (pak turut)”.
“Minister must speedily meet with the pro-tem committee… failure to do so would mean he and the government are no longer committed to the principles of free media,” he said.
The media council pro-tem committee was set up under the former Pakatan Harapan government of which Saifuddin had been a part of prior to its collapse, fulfilling a promise as stated in the Pakatan Harapan manifesto to set up a media council.
The committee, headed by Malaysiakini CEO Premesh Chandran (pictured, far right) had worked on a draft bill since then.
The lawmaker’s statement came following government probe into the recently aired Al Jazeera’s 101 East documentary “Locked Up in Malaysia’s Lockdown” on Malaysia’s handling of migrants in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The 25-minute report highlighted the alleged cramped conditions under which migrants were housed following the crackdown by authorities on undocumented migrants.
During the segment, the reporter questioned if the crackdown was the “practical reality of dealing with the pandemic or is it racism?”.
However, the international news agency further claimed that requests for responses by Defence Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob, Home Minister Hamzah Zainudin, and their deputies for comments were not entertained.
The allegations of racism and mistreatment have since been denied by the authorities, including Ismail, Hamzah and Health Minister Dr Adham Baba.
Prior to this, several media personnel have also been called in for questioning over their reporting and postings, including health news site CodeBlue editor-in-chief Boo Su-Lyn and South China Morning Post reporter Tashny Sukumaran.
Boo (below) was questioned over her coverage on findings from an independent inquiry into the 2016 Johor Bahru’s Sultanah Aminah Hospital (HSA) fire.
Tashny, meanwhile, was called in over tweets she posted when reporting on the May 1 immigration raid at Selangor Mansion in Kuala Lumpur. Her case was later classified as no further action.
According to Fahmi further, the actions taken by the new Perikatan Nasional government against the media could cause the country to slip in the Reporters Without Borders’ (RSF) press freedom rankings."

They are everywhere. Just everywhere. In almost every sector of the economy. And since they are mostly gainfully employed or are able to make a living serving Malaysians - they have every incentive to get in and stay.
But are they to be blamed? The government, since Dr Mahathir Mohamad's early days in office as prime minister, actively encouraged this influx through a series of short-sighted labour import policies.
That had resulted in the emergence of a flourishing migrant-licensing industry with agents, runners and later traffickers and enablers in the enforcement agencies.
And so, we have Indonesians, Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Myanmars, Indians and Rohingyas who have successfully filled nearly all available jobs involving manual labour as well as the services and even retail sectors.
Successive labour ministers, as well as employer federations, colluded to keep the supply chain going. After some time, it became impossible to separate the legal from the undocumented migrants and the documented workers from UNHCR card-carrying refugees.
As things stand now, no one has any idea exactly how many there are in the various categories. They are just everywhere, including sprawling ghettos in urban and suburban areas and in places like those decrepit Selangor and Malaysia ""mansions"", apart from the semi-permanent filthy kongsis that are now a staple of the construction industry
And despite the known futility of shutting the proverbial stable doors after the horses have bolted, there is now a new attempt to stem the tide fuelled by a new political will which in turn is powered by stark health and economic realities.
And in the new rush to please their political masters, enforcement agencies which previously ignored the growing numbers are now finally doing what they should have been doing all these years.
Why enforcement agencies did not do their duty previously is a question for a royal commission of inquiry (RCI) - not that RCIs have ever achieved or answered anything.
But those migrant/refugee NGOs which emerged over the years in response to the influx now need to consider the unintended consequences of their humanitarian acts - which served to attract and support migrants/undocumented workers.
In the end, all that is required is common sense tempered with a dose of humanity as the new policy takes form and substance.
But then again, will all those who gained by the influx - greedy employers, crooked politicians, agents, uniformed enablers and traffickers move on to do something else?"

They were unprepared for this task because even Singapore was caught with their pants down. They do not have the facilities to house these detainees, and probably no country is prepared for such a task.
Question is, are they going to deport them? Already, there are voices calling for them to be legalised again. The problem will continue."

Whatever it is, the Immigration Department chief is duty-bound to respond to the alleged scandalous state of affairs, failing which amounts to an admission of Quah's account of the inhuman and dismal conditions in the detention centre.
However, if this charade of roping in Quah as a sideshow is actually about the Al Jazeera documentary, the authorities must exercise their right to refute the documentary if they have the facts to do so.
In fact, considering its seriousness and our already battered international reputation as a kleptocracy, the authorities must go all out to rebut the ‘false’ accusations.
That would be the proper response rather than merely denouncing Al Jazeera."

（观察者网讯）香港国安法公布以来，一些西方国家政客不断指手画脚，意图干涉中国内政。在美国宣布取消香港特殊地位待遇后，加拿大紧跟其后宣布中止与香港的引渡条约。频频炒作反华议题的澳大利亚如今也不甘寂寞，跟风威胁要撕毁与香港的引渡条约。
据澳大利亚广播公司当地时间7月8日报道，澳大利亚官员已经向澳政府提交了一系列意见，其中就包括紧跟加拿大的脚步中止与香港引渡协议，澳大利亚政府正对这些意见进行研究。
报道称，澳内阁会议可能于当地时间8日晚间作出决定。澳司法部长克里斯蒂安·波特的发言人拒绝透露具体细节，但他表示澳大利亚会不断探讨各类国际安排以确保它们符合利益，这当然也包括引渡协议。
影子司法部长马克·德雷福斯则发表声明，要求莫里森政府“紧急重新审查”引渡协议。他妄称这是因为“从澳大利亚引渡到香港的嫌犯也将面临被送到内地的风险”，并声称澳外交部更新的旅游建议“证明了这一点”。"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=262","Jul 9, 2020 10:35 AM","FortunerLiew","德雷福斯所说的旅游建议指的是，澳外交部于当地时间7日更新的中国内地旅游提示。澳外交部在更新的提示中妄称澳大利亚公民在中国内地，可能面临“任意拘留”的风险。他借此声称这一系列“风险”使得澳大利亚无法与香港保持单独的引渡条约，并以此要求澳政府“立即采取措施退出条约”。
除引渡条约一事外，澳大利亚也没忘记在政治庇护问题上“跟风”。报道称，澳内阁还将讨论是否要为港人提供庇护。总理莫里森上周曾表示，澳大利亚可能会提供的新的安置途径，但未公布任何细节。澳媒推测，这可能会通过技术移民签证或是所谓的“人道主义项目”来实现。
澳大利亚的一些“人权组织”也没闲着。他们不留余力地抹黑香港国安法，并向政府施压。澳大利亚人权观察组织主任莱恩·皮尔森污蔑香港国安法“侵害自由表达”，还声称澳大利亚目前不会将面临政治犯罪起诉的人引渡到香港，鼓吹“完全中止引渡条约”来向中国“施压”。
报道称，共有30多个国家及地区同香港存在引渡协议，其中包括美国、英国、澳大利亚、新西兰等国。美国已公布其取消香港特殊地位待遇的“制裁措施”，加拿大紧跟美国的步伐公布了一系列“制裁措施”。目前，加拿大是首个也是唯一一个中止引渡协议的国家。
对于澳大利亚借香港国安法频繁炒作反华议题，妄图干涉中国内政一事，我外交部发言人赵立坚在7月2日的例行记者会上表示，我们注意到有关报道。我们奉劝澳方正确、客观看待香港国安法，立即停止借所谓香港问题干涉中国内政，不要在错误的道路上越走越远。
针对澳外交部的错误言论，赵立坚于7日再次强调，希望有关方面能够保持客观、公正的态度，多做有利于中澳关系发展的事。"

（布城8日讯）国防部长拿督斯里依斯迈沙比里指出，配合学校、公立与私立高等学府复课，马航同意让师生以及讲师预定机票时，享有20%折扣。
他说，学校教师、公共与私人高等教育机构的讲师，在购买本地航班的机票时，可享有20%的折扣。
他说，订购日期将从7月9日开始至8月10日，飞行日期为7月10日至11月30日。
“有关的折扣可通过线上预定，输入有关的促销代码获取，而教育部和高教部会宣布有关的促销代码。”
他说，学生也可享有20%折扣，方式是通过马航官网成为马航MHexplorer会员。
他说，折扣截止日期是11月30日或根据会员条例，或会员期限结束。
他是周三在记者会上，如是披露。依斯迈沙比里指出，随着部长级特别会议考量了大马航空委员会（Mavcom）提呈有关机票价格事项后，政府已经采取了积极行动，以便航空公司可以为教师、学生以及讲师提供特别价格。
他说，马航首席执行员依占依斯迈针对机票价格一事，前来拜访与商议后，讨论结果是马航同意提出有关的优惠。
他说，降低机票价格是为了协助这些师生和讲师返回职场，因为他们可能在近期内就要准备返回校园，所以有关的截止日期大约是落在年杪，预计11月大家全会返回校园。
他也非常感谢马航管理层提供有关优惠，并希望其他航空公司可以参与，一同降低机票价格。"

他在汇报会上指出，当政府开放跨州后，还是收到一些询问抵达东马是否还需要居家隔离。
“随着沙巴和砂拉越的新冠肺炎疫情受到控制后，国人不需要居家隔离。”
他进一步说，可能当抵达机场时，官员会进行抽样检测，而不是所有人都需要进行检测。
另外，针对被询及新加坡丈夫要入境探望大马籍生病太太却不被允许一事。沙比里说，凡是持有配偶签证者都可以进入我国。
“但如果没有配偶签证，则可以向移民局提出申请，并提供相关证据，比如太太生病的医院证明，出示给移民局以获得批准。”
他强调，任何大马籍的外国配偶都可以回国，这不该成为一个课题。"

哈萨克斯坦近日肺炎病例迅速增加，引起关注。哈卫生部长8日表示，该国肺炎的患者比新冠肺炎确诊患者多2至3倍。
据哈通社9日报道，哈萨克斯坦卫生部长阿列克谢·崔在8日的新闻发布会上表示，哈萨克斯坦患上肺炎的人数比确诊新冠肺炎的人数多2至3倍。
阿列克谢·崔表示，没有隐瞒任何数据，计划将于近期公布关于肺炎患者的准确数据。他说，在这种情况下没必要另外公布肺炎患者人数，但公众需要了解当前的真实情况，争取下周公布肺炎患者的人数。阿列克谢·崔还说，目前也出现了肺炎死亡病例。
据中国驻哈萨克斯坦大使馆微信公众号9日消息，根据哈萨克斯坦媒体报道，6月中旬以来哈萨克斯坦阿特劳州、阿克纠宾州和奇姆肯特市肺炎发病率较同期显著升高。截至目前，三地已有近5百人感染、30余人病危。今年上半年，哈肺炎共导致1772人死亡，仅6月就有628人死亡，其中也包括中国公民。
我驻哈大使馆的文章特别指出，该病致死率远高于新冠肺炎。哈卫生部等机构正对该肺炎病毒进行对比研究，尚未予以明确定性。中国驻哈使馆提醒在哈中国公民注意上述情况，切实提高防范意识，降低感染风险。"

尤其是从六月中旬开始，包括阿特劳州、奇姆肯特市的不明肺炎发病率都在呈现显著提升状态中。这两个地区已经有接近五百人感染，还有三十人处于高危。在今年的上半年时间，哈萨克斯坦出现的不明肺炎一共导致了1772人死亡，仅过去的30天内，就超出628人死亡。从不明肺炎的病死率去看，这份数据要远高于全球的新冠肺炎致死率。当前哈萨克斯坦的卫生部，以及外界组织机构正在对不明的肺炎病毒进行详细的科学调查研究。"

针对美方近日宣布实施“2018年对等进入西藏法案”，称将对中国政府及相关官员采取签证限制措施一事，外交部发言人赵立坚8日说，中方对有关举措表示坚决反对。针对美方的错误行径，中方决定对在涉藏问题上表现恶劣的美方人员实施签证限制。
赵立坚在当日例行记者会上说，中方敦促美方立即停止借涉藏问题干涉中国内政，不要在错误的道路上越走越远，以免给中美关系和两国交流与合作造成进一步的损害。
赵立坚说，关于美方所谓的“2018年对等进入西藏法案”，中方已多次表明严正立场。西藏事务纯属中国内政，不容任何外部势力干涉。
“中国奉行对外开放政策。西藏是开放的西藏，从未作出限制外国人进藏的规定。”赵立坚表示，西藏每年都要接待大量外国游客和各界人士。据不完全统计，2015年至2018年，西藏方面就已经接待进行公务、旅游、商务等活动的外国朋友近17.6万人次，其中游客近17.5万人次、外交官约500人次、记者343人次。
“去年，西藏全年接待国内外游客更是突破4000万人次。美国驻华大使布兰斯塔德也曾于去年赴藏参访，同自治区人民政府多个部门座谈，有关报道在媒体上都可以看到。这充分说明外国人进藏不存在问题。”赵立坚说。
他说，考虑到西藏特殊的地理和气候条件等因素，中国政府依法依规对外国人入藏采取了一定的管理和保护措施，这完全必要，无可非议。中方欢迎更多外国人士到中国西藏地区访问、旅游、经商，这一政策不会改变，但前提是必须遵守中国的法律和相关规定，履行必要的手续。"

（吉隆坡9日讯）中总社会经济研究中心（SERC）促请政府，重新考虑推出“不受欢迎”的消费税（GST），税率可维持3%至4%，以增加国家收入。
中总社会经济研究中心执行董事李兴裕指出，在油价严重影响国家收入的当下，此举有助于提高政府收入，再加上政府料在这2年维持具一定开销的财政预算案，必须增加国家收入来应付开支。
李兴裕今日举行线上汇报会，公布2020年第二季度经济追踪报告时，做出这项建议。
他也建议，政府可将消费税定在3至4%的税率，并豁免中等及低收入家庭的消费物品的消费税。
他进一步指出，政府应提高缴消费税的中小型企业营业额的门槛，让小型企业可以豁免消费税"

PETALING JAYA: Just as most Malaysians are heaving a sigh of relief that the country is in the recovery stage of the Covid-19 pandemic, another problem is looming – the annual haze.
The haze which normally occurs between June and October may make a comeback if neighbouring countries and Malaysia fail to control open burning that is the cause of transboundary haze.
Medical experts are concerned that the haze may cause further problems to those already infected with Covid-19.
Malaysian Public Health Physicians’ Association president Datuk Dr Zainal Ariffin Omar said risk groups such as children and the elderly who are Covid-19 positive will face enhanced respiratory problems if the haze occurs.
Dr Zainal said as Covid-19 spreads through droplets and is not an airborne virus, people could protect themselves by continuing to mask up whether or not haze occurs this year.
“There has been no evidence or study that the haze situation will increase the spread of Covid-19, so technically it’s a very remote possibility.
“But because the virus spreads through droplets, using a face mask will lessen the possibility of infection.
“I would advise people to continue using a face mask, before, during and after the haze,” he said.
Environment Department air division director Mashitah Darus said Asean countries need to be certain that this does not recur this year.
“This is because polluted air can increase the risk of Covid-19 infection to the general public.
“In this season, the southern part of the South-East Asian region that covers major Indonesian islands such as Sumatra and Kalimantan and Peninsular Malaysia will experience a dry season with surface temperatures above normal levels and rainfall less than other seasons,” Mashitah told The Star.
For this reason, the control of haze-causing forest fires should be monitored more closely for the dry season, she said.
In June, the current state of air quality based on the Air Pollutant Index (API) reading showed that almost all air quality in the country was at a moderate level.
The department also issued a strong warning to all landowners to monitor their land, especially in vulnerable and often burned areas such as peatlands, farms, construction sites, landfills including illegal dumping sites, forests, shrubs and industrial areas.
“Landowners are required to take steps to prevent invasion by irresponsible parties resulting in open burning.
“Strict action will be taken against any irresponsible party causing open burning, including landowners,” said Mashitah.
Under Section 29 (A) of the Environmental Quality Act 1974, those convicted of an open burning offence may be subject to a fine of up to RM500,000 or imprisonment of up to five years or both.
Among others, the department is patrolling and using drones to monitor open burning incidents and fire-prone areas such as peatlands and waste disposal sites; monitoring the current air quality status; and enhancing community participation to help monitor cases.
Quoting media reports, Mashitah said Indonesia had started cloud seeding operations as the country’s first step in overcoming its annual forest fires, believed to be the cause of haze around South-East Asia.
“Indonesia began implementing cloud seeding in the Riau hotspot in Sumatra, with plans to do so in other parts of Borneo.
“This operation will continue throughout the dry season, which is expected to continue until the end of September and the focus is on peatlands that are flammable when dried for agricultural purposes,” she said.
On July 1, Reuters reported that the Central Kalimantan province in Indonesia declared a state of emergency until Sept 28 after identifying over 700 fires.
Meanwhile, the Malaysian Meteorological Department said the API for most places in the country was currently at a normal level, with most places in Sabah and Sarawak registering good air quality while the peninsula had good or moderate readings.
Its director-general Jailan Simon said as of Wednesday night, there was only one hotspot in Sumatra and none in Kalimantan, due to rain.“Rain is expected over the next few days in the areas so we won’t be experiencing transboundary haze for the time being,” he said when contacted.
The Asean Specialised Meteorological Centre also noted that rainy weather prevailed over many parts of the Asean region yesterday and hotspot activities in the region remained generally subdued.
Meanwhile, the Fire and Rescue Department said it recorded a total of 94 open burning cases at forests in May and June as well as 54 cases at farms or orchards in the same period.
For forests, there were 50 open burning cases in May followed by 44 cases in June while at farms or orchards, there were 31 cases in May and 23 incidents the following month."

Post the disposal of its remaining 51% interest in the loss-making timber business Aturmaju (Sabah) Holdings Sdn Bhd (AHSB) for RM5.6m on 24th June 2020, ARB has fully transformed itself to be involved in the IT business, focussing mainly on the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). Since the transformation started in 4Q18 when the group decided to diversify into the IT segment, it has then experienced a significant jump in its FY19 earnings to RM34.8m (+828%YoY). The higher earnings was attributed to sales from: (i) Small and Medium Enterprise (SMEs) (given their low adoption of business digitalisation), and (ii) Government-linked Companies in South East Asia.
The stock (which was unchanged at RM0.32 yesterday) has recently been trending sideway after retracing from a high of RM0.42.
From an Ichimoku technical perspective, the stock is currently staging a potential “Kumo Breakout”, which could head towards our resistance target of RM0.39 (+21.8% potential upside). Meanwhile, should the buying momentum persist the next resistance level can be seen at RM0.42 (+31.2%).
Our stop loss level is pegged at RM0.265 (or 17.1% downside risk).
From a fundamental perspective, the group is currently trading at an undemanding PER of 3.3x (based on historical earnings) with a net cash position of 8.6 sen/share (representing c.30% of its share price)"

冲绳县政府称，接到美军通报，此次聚集性疫情的病例于周二到周六期间，被在美军驻冲绳的美军普天间和汉森营两处基地被确认，目前两个基地均已被封锁。冲绳县政府称，美军第三海上远征军兼美军在冲绳驻军的负责人史黛西·克拉迪（Stacy Clardy）通过电话向冲绳方面解释了基地内的感染状况。
史黛西·克拉迪强调目前所有呈新冠病毒阳性反应的基地内人员已经处于隔离状态。
此前据央视新闻7月12消息，冲绳县11日宣布，本月7日至11日冲绳美军基地已累计出现61例新冠肺炎确诊病例。
冲绳县知事玉城丹尼11日召开记者会公布有关情况时说，对这一消息感到“冲击”和“极为遗憾”，并表示“不得不对驻冲绳美军的防疫对策强烈怀疑”。"

PUTRAJAYA: China's military encroached into Sabah’s and Sarawak's waters in the South China Sea 89 times from 2016 to 2019, says the third series of the Auditor-General's Report 2018.
Of the 89 times, the China Coast Guard (CCG) intruded into Malaysian waters 72 times while the remaining were by the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), the report added.
""Our audit found that the reason for the CCG and PLAN's existence was to demonstrate China's presence in regard to its South China Sea claims, especially in the Beting Patinggi Ali (BPA) area,"" stated the report released on Tuesday (July 14).
It added that the intrusion of CCG ships increased in 2017 but decreased in 2018 and 2019.
Despite it reducing, China started to place PLAN ships in the country's maritime zone, the report noted.
""The Royal Malaysian Navy (TLDM) took action by chasing the concerned ships out and submitted a report of the intrusion to the Foreign Ministry to make a diplomatic protest. But the ships from China continued to trespass into the country's maritime zone,"" it said.
The report added that the first diplomatic protest was made in 2017 in response to the diplomatic protest note from China involving its claims in the South China Sea, especially in the BPA zone.
In 2018 and 2019, the report said, five diplomatic protest notes were made on China's intrusion into Malaysian waters in the South China Sea.
Separately, the report also noted that in its audit, the negotiations on the maritime borders between Malaysia and Indonesia as well as Singapore were still ongoing, including solutions to solve related maritime border issues.
The report found that spoiled assets and the wide area of Malaysia's Maritime Zone (MMZ) had made it difficult for security control activities and enforcement activities in the area.
It pointed out that 34.6% of the boats or ships of enforcement agencies in the MMZ were unusable, adding that this has affected the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations."

A day after the White House announced it would reject nearly all of China’s maritime claims in the South China Sea, the U.S. warship Ralph Johnson steamed through the contested waters Tuesday, according to U.S. 7th Fleet officials.
The guided-missile destroyer navigated near the Spratly Islands, a network of islands and man-made atolls created by Beijing in recent years and militarily fortified to bolster China’s claims that such territory is theirs, not international waters.
But the United States and other western powers continue to contend the busy waters are international, resulting in displays like the Ralph Johnson freedom of navigation operation, known in mil-speak as a FONOP."

The Philippine presidential spokesperson, Harry Roque, noted that the two powers would woo his country as they escalate their rivalry, but “what is important now is to prioritize the implementation and crafting of a code of conduct to prevent tension in that area.”
James Chin, head of the Asia Institute at the University of Tasmania in Australia, said the U.S. stance was nothing new because it has always rejected China’s “nine-dash line,” as its claim to the South China Sea is known.

KUALA LUMPUR, July 10 — Malaysia is a country blessed with many natural resources that is seeing poverty growing due to a deeply entrenched culture that prioritises self-profit among a small band of those in power, Opposition Leader Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said tonight.
The PKR president was weighing in on recent reports that more Malaysians were feeling poorer today, with more segments of the population being marginalised even as the country aspired towards being a high-income nation.
He urged the ruling politicians from Perikatan Nasional (PN) to accept the reality of the pervasive poverty in Malaysia and revise their priorities to reverse the population’s financial pain.
“There is a need to react to poverty more proactively. We cannot, for example, use power only to enrich a small number of people, or the excuse that PN is out to save the Malays whereas the first to be saved are the MPs with their new positions or the excessive number of ministers,” he said in Facebook “live” talk on poverty in Malaysia."

“Malaysia fortunately has more than enough resources and wealth to address the issue of poverty. Therefore there is no excuse to not prioritise the problem at hand,” he said.
Referring to United Nations’ special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights Philip Alston’s report released in August last year, Anwar said many were shocked that the government’s claims of poverty not exceeding 0.4 per cent was “unbelievable”.
“In KL and Selangor it is apparent, and poverty is even more severe in Sabah, Sarawak, and Terengganu. Looking at the other cities, it is clear that thousands of others can be categorised as poor."

A study by noted Universiti Malaya economist Prof Fatimah Kari which took a multidimensional approach in terms of education, health and housing, also indicated the problem is more serious than what is publicly known,” Anwar said.
Fatimah’s study looked at Employees Provident Fund reports, which stated that up to 84 per cent of retirees can be considered marginally or severely poor. Among the 84 per cent, women are by far poorer than men in terms of transportation, housing, income, and education.
“This is particularly the case among Indian retirees, followed by the Malays. Therefore, we must ensure that EPF savings are defended, for it guarantees a degree of living in comfort in the future."

Anwar also questioned the tens of billions of ringgit from the Amanah Saham Bumiputera set aside for the Malays and Bumiputeras, which he claimed seemed to have disappeared among a select few.
“Secondly, hundreds of acres of Malay reserve land have now disappeared. What about the high rates of unemployment in the rural areas and among the urban poor? Thus, the political leadership needs to have the will to act in concert, and to ensure Parliament can debate poverty effectively and guarantee more efficient ways to resolve it."

Hopefully in this manner, and by allocating at least RM26 to RM28 billion for the poor, can poverty begin to be properly addressed,” he said.
The Port Dickson MP added that the Parliamentary Reform and Governance Caucus which he chaired last September invited various economic experts including Prof Jomo Kwame Sundaram and Prof Rajah Rasiah to brief MPs from across the political divide.
“Despite differing viewpoints, the government was urged to accept the statement and new facts. We can ask why after 60 years of independence, and nearly 50 years after the New Economic Policy’s attempt at implementing wealth redistribution, the effects of poverty are still saddening to see, especially among Malays and the Bumiputera of Sabah and Sarawak."

To stop the exodus, government should take steps to develop the rural areas and change its old and drably outlook into something bright and lively, with a taste of mini city life.
To start to roll out the initial phase of the development, government has to integrate the plots of lands adjacent to each other in the area, into a single entity and convert them into a vast commercial farms planted with fruits and vegetables and also set up farms specially for rearing chicken and goats. It will offer employment opportunities for able bodied rural folks to work in he farms, hence increase their incomes.
All the old and dilapidated houses standing in the area have to be demolished and have to be rebuilt.
The new houses, modern compound hoses, complete with modern amenities and electricity, have to be built in orderly rows, to be located in the strategic central area, complete with shop houses, market, library and kindergarten and other amenities, to allow the people to have a taste of mini town life.
If this suggestion could be successfully implemented, the incomes of the rural folks could possibly increase by leaps and bounds to enable them to improve their social status. In this regard, they will find more comfort and happiness to stay in the kampungs to raise their families.
This will be the best solution to deter rural folks from migrating to the city and ending in looking at the mirage."

2. The urban poor have to struggle everyday to put food on the table (a more exhausting struggle than the one supposedly waged by crooked and immensely wealthy Malay politicians for ""race and religion"")
3. The urban poor (often clustered in ethnic ghettos) are used as ready vote banks by scheming politicians who view poverty almost always from an ethnic standpoint.
4. The urban poor are deliberately NOT discouraged from having large families by the same conniving politicians
5. The lot of the urban poor seldom improves unlike the wealth of the politicians who champion their cause.
6. The rural urban drift was actively encouraged by myopic extremist politicians who could not stand to see ""others owning towns"". ""Rural Development"" always a Federal Ministry since independence, clearly did not cause a reversal or discourage migration while creating economic opportunities in situ.

JOHOR BARU: Pasir Gudang MCA members are seeking an apology from Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad after he claimed that Chinese were ""rich and owned all the cities in Malaysia"".
Pasir Gudang MCA deputy public complaints bureau chief Ang Tun Chek said the remarks by the former prime minister could instigate disunity among the races.
""As the former prime minister and an MP, I would expect him to work towards uniting the races and not the opposite.
""It is unfair to the Chinese community that he has labeled us as rich and owners of cities in the country when, clearly, cities are not owned by any race but by their respective state governments,"" he said during a press conference at the Pasir Gudang MCA office here on Wednesday (July 1).
Ang said he was also disappointed that some Chinese politicians had not spoken out on the matter.
""As representatives of the people, they should voice out against such racially sensitive remarks,"" he said, adding that Dr Mahathir had also received many votes from the Chinese during the last general election.
""We've made a police report against his statement and we want an official apology.
""I would also like to plead with the Malaysian Chinese not to take Dr Mahathir's remarks to heart, and not harbour ill intent against any race in the country because of what he said,"" he added.
Earlier, The Star reported that MCA president Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong had rebutted the former prime minister's claims.
He said there were enough recent reports to show that the Chinese, in all levels of income, had already declined.
“I am not sure if Dr Mahathir is pretending not to know or whether he is merely playing the racial card, ” Dr Wee had said"

DAP secretary-general Lim Guan Eng reminded one and all, in a thinly veiled criticism against former prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad, that ethnicity had little to do with wealth.
This came after Mahathir reportedly said in an interview with Asia Times that Chinese Malaysians had become extremely rich and “practically own all the towns in Malaysia”.
He reportedly said that such disparity in wealth was unhealthy.
In his Facebook post last night, Lim (above) said the Chinese in Malaysia were tired of such “simplistic” labelling, as there exist many Chinese who were not rich and many non-Chinese who were.
“Malaysia is not colour-coded, we are all Malaysians who live together in the towns, cities, and villages.
“Similarly, skin colour does not guarantee that you are rich or poor. This is wrong,” Lim said, although he did not name Mahathir in his statement.
He urged Malaysians not to be divided along racial lines, but instead to unite on common principles such as upholding justice, freedom, prosperity for all, as well as to fight against corruption and abuse of power.
Previously, Mahathir’s remark on this matter also drew criticism from other leaders in DAP and PKR, who accused him of perpetuating the “rich Chinese” narrative.
Among others, Semambu assemblyperson Lee Chean Chung cited the work of economist Muhammed Abdul Khalid and said that intra-ethic differences accounted for 93.71 percent of economic disparity, while inter-ethnic differences accounted for only 6.39 percent. Muhammed previously served as Mahathir’s economic advisor."

Agreeing to take on the position of House speaker from Mohamad Ariff Md Yusof was itself puzzling. Ariff was exceptional as the speaker. Professional and even-handed.
Why did Azhar step down as Election Commission (EC) chairperson? We all assumed that he was doing an exemplary job as EC chairperson. What greater good was being served by accepting the speaker's position?
Mahathir has set the tone - DAP bad as being a Chinese party, PKR bad as not being a Malay party. And the necessity for a unity party that was Malay dominant with nominal Chinese and Indian participation.
So that is now the operating mode. Mahathir’s former colleague Wan Saiful Wan Jan, for all his previous preaching, has Veered to the other side. One can only hope that Azhar stays the course set by his own articulated standards.
As for the EC, we can hope that deputy chairperson Azmi Sharom will be confirmed as EC chief.
Will ambition trump principle every time? Wherein are the visionary statesmen that will lead us out of this darkness?

Not to be outdone, brother Azhar has forgotten his sermons on righteousness and good upbringing when, as the speaker, he allowed Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim to get away with obnoxious statements, not once but twice in a spate of a few seconds.
The bigger joke is that Abdul Azeez referred to MP Kasthuriraani Patto’s dark complexion.

Many outlets don't even take down your particulars or conduct temperature checks anymore.
Why hasn't the Government made it mandatory for all food outlet workers and other customer facing industries to wear face masks at all times? Majority have stopped wearing and when questioned they say its not part of the SOP.
Social distancing is also no longer being practised. Almost everyone seated at restaurants and bars do not observe the SOP.
This is very worrying because it seems the Government has also become sloppy and overconfident. There is insufficient enforcement. Go to the ground and see what's happening. It's as if there is no Covid-19 threat. Everyone is so relaxed."

中央社〕英國今天宣布，中止與香港間的引渡協議，使英國和中國因「港區國安法」實施所產生的爭議加劇。
英國外交大臣拉布 （Dominic Raab）在國會表示，英、港間的引渡協議立即中止，同時英國對中國實施的武器禁運擴大到香港。
拉布說：「除非出現明確且強有力的保障，足以防止自英國引渡出境的機制被港區國安法濫用，否則我們不會考慮恢復這項引渡協議。」
這對英國前首相卡麥隆（David Cameron）2015年所稱英、中關係的「黃金時代」，形成了另一次致命打擊。
倫敦律師事務所Peters & Peters合夥人瓦莫斯（Nick Vamos）指出：「香港與英國間的引渡案極為罕見，所以這只是個象徵性姿態，但卻是個非常重要的姿態。」"

身家暴涨567亿美元！短短半年，离婚时支付的天价“分手费”，贝佐斯都挣回来了
人们常说，越有钱的人赚钱越容易，这在世界首富贝佐斯身上体现得十分明显。
创始人、首席执行官杰夫．贝佐斯的身价最近超过1700亿美元，重新达到其个人财富的巅峰。令人惊奇的是，因为离婚，贝佐斯被分掉的美元财富，竟然在一年多后全部补回来了"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=279","Jul 21, 2020 11:04 AM","ZackRaider","贝佐斯身价突破历史高点
7月2日周四，亚马逊股价收涨0.4%，达到2890.30美元的历史高点，市值达1.44万亿美元。自3月16日触及近期低点以来，亚马逊股价已上涨超71%；而自今年以来，亚马逊股价涨幅达56.42%。
随着新冠病毒疫情在全球的蔓延，欧美大多数国家已普遍要求民众居家隔离，线上购物正火得飞起，这给亚马逊这个电商巨头带来了庞大商机。新冠肺炎疫情危机和居家抗疫措施令线上购物需求暴增，亚马逊此前曾表示，将增加175000名仓库和送货工人，以追赶不断增长的需求。
股价暴涨，贝佐斯身价水涨船高，飙升至1716亿美元。
根据彭博亿万富豪指数（Bloomberg Billionaires Index），上述数字打破了贝佐斯在2018年9月创下的1677亿美元个人财富纪录。值得注意的是，上一次创造纪录时，贝佐斯尚未与前妻麦肯齐闹离婚。
20多年前，麦肯齐和贝佐斯在同一家对冲基金工作时相识，两人1993年结婚。1994年，贝佐斯创立亚马逊，麦肯齐是当时亚马逊的会计，也是亚马逊最早的员工之一。两人婚后共抚养四名子女。"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=279","Jul 21, 2020 11:12 AM","ZackRaider","去年，拥有逾千亿美元身价的贝佐斯与麦肯齐达成离婚协议。由于贝佐斯和麦肯齐在结婚时并没有签过婚前协议，他们夫妇在离婚前则共同持有约16%的亚马逊股份，根据他们所在的华盛顿州法律，麦肯齐本可分到一半身价，但她选择了慷慨放手，最终只分走了亚马逊4%的股票，当时这部分股票的价值达383亿美元。此后，贝佐斯手中仅剩11%左右的亚马逊股份。
这笔天价“分手费”被外界称之为世界最贵离婚协议，当时彭博亿万富翁指数仍将贝佐斯列为全球第一富豪，并估计其净资产为1180亿美元。"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=279","Jul 21, 2020 11:12 AM","ZackRaider","在此之前，数据分析公司Comparisun曾预测称，如果贝佐斯的净资产继续以34%的年化增长率增长，那么贝佐斯的总身价可能会在2026年底之前突破1万亿美元大关，届时的他已经62岁。
不过外界分析认为，虽然这种前景非常诱人，但实际发生的可能性并不大。
根据贝佐斯持股比例计算，亚马逊总市值需要达到近11万亿美元，才能使得其身价突破1万亿美元，届时亚马逊股价可能需要达到12600美元以上。
财富不平等加剧
近期，美国科技巨头股价屡创新高，其中今年以来涨幅近10%，奈飞涨47.38%，涨31.52%，涨13.72%。相应的，这些公司的创始人所持股份均迎来增值，比如比尔·盖茨身价增至了4.8亿美元，扎克伯格身价增长了118亿美元，拉里佩奇身价增长了40亿美元。"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=279","Jul 21, 2020 11:12 AM","ZackRaider","与上述富豪财富增值相对应的是，美国普通人的就业情况不乐观。
美东时间7月2日8：30，据美国劳工部公布的就业报告显示，6月份美国失业率降至11.1%，明显低于5月的13.3%；6月非农就业人口环比增加480万，也明显好于预期。
这一消息让美国总统特朗普大为振奋，他立即在社交媒体上发文：“伟大的就业数据。”9：03，白宫紧急通知各大媒体，将在27分钟后召开发布会。"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=279","Jul 21, 2020 11:12 AM","ZackRaider","面对一群被临时召集到新闻简报室的记者，特朗普宣布：“这是我们国家历史上最大的月度就业增长。” “今天的报告证明我们的经济正在回升。” 他表示：“所有这些令人难以置信的消息都是因为我的政府采取了历史性的行动．．．．．．以挽救美国经济．．．．．．”
但是该数据能否真实反映目前的美国就业情况？据新华社报道，6月，衡量在职和求职人口总数占劳动年龄人口比例的劳动参与率环比上涨0.7个百分点至61.5%，但仍较2月份水平低1.9个百分点。
由于劳工部就业报告的样本调查是在6月中旬进行，随后美国佛罗里达州等多州疫情大幅反弹，导致当地重启部分封锁措施，当月就业报告未能完全反映出实际失业状况。
劳工部当天公布的另一份报告显示，截至6月27日一周，美国首次申请失业救济人数达到142.7万。截至6月20日一周，显示投保人员中正接受失业救济人数占比的投保失业率仍维持在13.2%的历史高位。
实际上，和白宫的乐观恰恰相反，美国各界近期一再警告，经济全面复苏会很漫长，就业形势不容乐观。旧金山联储银行行长玛丽·戴利7月1日预计，即便按最佳情景假设，美国在今年底的失业率仍将超过10%，4到5年内都无法回到危机前的水平。
众议院民主党党鞭吉姆·克莱伯恩（Jim Clyburn）1日对媒体说：“公共卫生危机结束，就业危机才能结束。”“本届政府将头埋在沙子里，并假装病毒会奇迹般地消失，不会的。这种做法只会延长我们国家的危机。”"

Good knowledge.
This only will help to upgrade forecast on basic calculations.
In fact, all shld learn this basic knowledge in stocks market, rather than cheering or cursing, talking obout dump n pum, operators n so on.
It does not help.
Pity many trade blindly, refuse to learn.
Can't even understand rights, icps, or / LR, and what is corperate exercises or structuring.
What many want are fish, but not to learn how to fish.

KUALA LUMPUR: A certain ""pink bracelet"" is making many see red.
With the battle against Covid-19 far from over, those returning from overseas and told to undergo home quarantine are under the spotlight as some of them have been spotted outside.
The Health Ministry adopted the use of a ""pink hospital tag"" to be worn by those under home quarantine for 14 days.
This generally means that those still sporting the tag should not be out in public.
In the most recent ""spot the pink tag game"", a photograph of one man with one such tag on his wrist sitting at an eatery allegedly in Desa Sri Hartamas, here, has gone viral on social media.
A source told Harian Metro that as of yesterday, the police has yet to receive a report on the matter.
""The police will check on the photo that is being shared on social media.
""The public is advised to immediately channel such information to the police,"" the source remarked when contacted yesterday."

KUCHING: Dewan Bahasa and Pustaka (DBP)’s claim of the failure of the Teaching and Learning of Science and Mathematics in English (PPSMI) could be due to a lack of preparation, opined Minister of Education, Science and Technological Research Dato Sri Michael Manyin Jawong."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=280","Jul 22, 2020 11:54 AM","ZackRaider","He said PPSMI in Sarawak, which commenced early this year, involved special training for the teachers involved.
“If it (PPSMI) was a failure, it was because there was no proper programme to prepare the teachers involved.
“Unlike the Sarawak PPSMI, which started in the beginning of this year, the teachers involved had been given a special programme conducted by qualified English lecturers from IPGs (teachers education institutes) throughout Malaysia,” he told thesundaypost.
Manyin said Sarawak PPSMI was to be monitored, but this had to be put on hold due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Ours is not a dual-programme but PPSMI (all primary schools except aided-Chinese primary schools), that Mathematics and Science are all taught in English, effective beginning of this year,” he said.
Meanwhile, Assistant Minister of Education, Science and Technological Research Dr Annuar Rapaee said he would need to read the research findings before commenting further as he could not just accept DBP board of directors chairpman Prof Datuk Dr Awang Sariyan’s conclusions."

To be honest this situation will never change because there is no will or want to change. It is more of will to do not want to change and progress.

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=280","Jul 22, 2020 11:59 AM","DannyFangs","Is teaching Science and Mathematics in English truly a failure ? Or it is due to some unexplained hidden reason that was not revealed to the public ? It is perceived that the failure was entirely due to poor preparation and the lack of firm commitment on the part of the government. It is believed that there were not enough teachers who were sufficiently proficient in English to teach the subjects. For not being able to speak English adequately, they were not able to deliver their lessons effectively, leaving the students in the lurch. It was also known that Science and Mathematics teachers who normally delivered the subjects in Malay, were asked to use English to teach the subjects.
These are the pertinent reasons which probably lead to the failure of the teaching of Science and Mathematics.
As such, it is justifiable that the teaching of Science and Mathematics in English should be reinstated, with firm government commitment and adequate preparation. To supplement the lack of competent English teachers, government has to recruit foreign teachers, either from Singapore, Britain or US, on temporary basis.
To raise Malaysia to a better level of technological progress, it has to place greater emphasis on the teaching of Science and Mathematics in schools. South Korea and Taiwan which are well advanced technologically, at one stage, were at the same level of development as Malaysia. Therefore if Malaysia, intends to raise its technological progress, it has to place greater emphasis on the study of Science and Mathematics, using English as the medium of instruction for the time being until Malay language is fully developed into a world class status and fit and adequate to be used to teach Science and Mathematics."

PETALING JAYA: The National Film Development Corporation Malaysia (Finas) has confirmed that Al Jazeera had filmed the Locked Up in Malaysia’s Lockdown documentary without a licence.
In a statement issued today, Finas’ corporate communications unit also noted that the international news agency lacked any certificate to give them filming rights in the country.
It said this was based on initial investigations, after the documentary courted controversy for its report accusing the government of discriminatory treatment of illegal immigrants during the movement control order (MCO)."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=282","Jul 23, 2020 12:31 PM","RandySavage","News outlet Al Jazeera did not have the necessary licence to film or air its documentary on the alleged mistreatment of migrants in Malaysia, the National Film Development Corporation Malaysia (Finas) said today.
In a brief statement today, Finas said it had carried out an investigation on Al Jazeera International (M) Sdn Bhd regarding the production of the documentary titled Locked Up In Malaysia’s Lockdown, which Finas said was aired over social media.
“From the findings of preliminary investigations, Finas found that that company does not have a Film Production Licence and that there was no application for a Certificate for Filming for the filming of that documentary,” Finas said in the statement posted on its official Facebook page."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=282","Jul 23, 2020 12:31 PM","RandySavage","“Finas will give its full cooperation to the Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM) in carrying out investigations against Al Jazeera (M) Sdn Bhd under Section 22(1) of the Perbadanan Kemajuan Filem Nasional Malaysia Act 1981 (Amendment 2013) for carrying out filming activities, that is the activity of producing a documentary film without a valid licence from Finas,” it concluded.
Malay Mail’s check of the Act shows Section 22(1) as stating that no person shall engage in any activities of production, distribution or exhibition of films or any combination of these activities unless there is a licence authorising the person to carry out such activities.
Under Section 25 of the same Act, it is stated that any person who contravenes any provisions of the part of the law — which includes Section 22(1) — is guilty of an offence.
The same Section 25 provides for a punishment of a maximum fine of RM50,000 or a maximum jail term of two years or both if a person is convicted of an offence under the Act, with a maximum daily fine of RM10,000 if the offence is a continuing offence.
Among other things, Finas’ functions under the Act include the development of the film industry, and the regulation and control of the production, distribution and exhibition of films in Malaysia and to issue licences for such purposes.
Yesterday, Communications and Multimedia Minister Datuk Saifuddin Abdullah reportedly said his ministry will check if Al Jazeera had obtained a licence from Finas to produce the documentary before it started production, saying that a lack of licence would be considered an offence as permission from Finas is needed before films and documentaries can be produced in Malaysia.
National news agency Bernama had yesterday also reported Saifuddin as saying that his ministry will via the Information Department check if Al Jazeera had violated media accreditation conditions.
Saifuddin was reported saying that the Information Department will cancel Al Jazeera’s media accreditation if it was found to have violated such conditions, noting that the crew would not be free to go anywhere without the media cards issued by the department."

Among other things, CIJ had urged the government to drop all investigations into Al Jazeera, while also urging Saifuddin to support media independence and press freedom.
The CIJ said the government should provide a data-based rebuttal of the Al Jazeera documentary instead of merely branding it as allegedly misleading or inaccurate, pointing out that the government had instead initiated police investigations and questioned Al Jazeera staff over the documentary.
The CIJ reiterated its call for an internal investigation by the government over the potential issues in the treatment of undocumented migrants during the movement control order, also urging Saifuddin to proceed with the formation of the Malaysian Media Council “as a transparent and independent self-regulatory body for the industry and to avoid the government and its agencies from becoming the sole arbiter of truth”."

That is pretty clear and understandable as there are local sensitivities of race and religion to be considered. In fact if he wants to make any form of video recording, he must get a permit. That is equally clear. As clear as high-definition.
Let us fade to black and cut to Scene 2. Al Jazeera comes in and tells FINAS it wants to shoot a documentary on “Illegal Immigrants in Malaysia”. What will the chairman say, that is, when he has recovered from his shock? “Sure, brother, it’s Camera Lights Action all the way for you”?
Assuming that FINAS does give its approval, we will still have the next issue. Will FINAS demand final cut that over-rides director’s cut and that just like the authority to reject an application without offering any reason, they can also censor as their discretion dictates? I think we can guess what the response would be to any film where those in authority are not quite presented as vestal virgins.
Who knows, we might yet see The Return of Al Jazeera, with an application to shoot “Parliament and Parliamentarians”. Tissues recommended. Art is not always truth."

And hopefully an improvement in labour rights in Malaysia as a result, or at least greater awareness of the issue, which would be a first step towards improvement.
As the government clamps down on the media locally, Malaysians will be increasingly reliant on foreign media to reveal what is going on on the ground on this and other issues.

KUALA LUMPUR, July 20 — Datuk Azhar Azizan @ Harun has denied instructing High Court Judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah to grant adjournment for Umno MP Datuk Seri Najib Razak so he can deliver his debate during his 1MDB trial on July 16, last week.
The Dewan Rakyat Speaker told the Lower House this morning when he was queried by Pakatan Harapan (PH) lawmaker and Tanjong Malim MP Chang Lih Kang, that he had made a request for the adjournment."

That morning, he requested for adjournment for his trial so he can go to Parliament but it was denied. We have a doctrine of separation of powers.
“Unlike the Parliament in UK, where it is supreme, the powers of the judiciary, executive and legislative here are the same. I made a request to the judge and he gave his consent to allow Pekan to attend Parliament. I did not instruct him,” said Azhar."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=283","Jul 23, 2020 1:14 PM","SonGokuSSJ5","However, Chang pressed the newly minted Speaker and told him that the debate speech could have been postponed to a later date when it did not clash with Najib’s trial.
Pasir Salak MP Datuk Seri Tajuddin Abdul Rahman then interjected, claiming that Chang was raising a petty matter in Parliament.
Chang then demanded if Azhar was setting a new precedent where anyone on trial will be able to obtain leave and attend Parliament sittings in the future.
An irate Azhar told the Lower House that there were already precedents set on this matter, implying that it was related to certain Opposition leaders.
“I requested his honourable judge’s consideration, I did not give him any instructions,” said Azhar."

Justice Sequerah decided to sit through the customary lunch break, having read a letter received from Azhar.
At around 1.06pm, the judge said that he had managed to view and digest the letter from the Speaker which he was not able to do earlier as he had been hearing the 1MDB trial since morning with only short breaks.
“What I’ve decided to do, if your client’s supposed to be there at 3.30pm, I have decided to go on, continue without lunch break. I’ll stop at 3.15pm. Your client can proceed to Parliament, it’s just around the corner,” he said.
“I must put on record, there’s something on calendar in Parliament. I don’t know what...it wasn’t informed earlier. I don’t want to waste time, I’ll proceed. Unless I’m informed well in advance on the next occasion, I will not be entertaining any more requests for similar adjournment,” he added."

Thus, in conceding to the letter from the Parliament speaker, High Court judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah was merely extending elegant courtesy.The letter from Parliament also makes us wonder as to the contents. And is this going to be the new normal?
That each time a Member of Parliament, as Najib Abdul Razak is, is hauled up to the courts, as many other MPs hopefully will be, there would be a letter from Parliament asking for its member to be excused from class?
But hold, bubbly defence lawyer Shafee Abdullah. Don’t nick another notch on your gun-belt.
Judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah (above) has been extremely accommodating to your many requests, including attending your son’s wedding when you asked for a postponement of court proceedings.
If I were you, I would start getting worried, very worried. Should the final decision be against your client, would you have any grounds to argue that the judge had been predisposed against you or your client?
Even today, the writing on the wall was pretty clear. The court proceedings did not end for lunch and in fact, the hearing continued.
And to make it worse, proceedings will end only at 3.15pm, leaving your client just 15 minutes to ‘mat rempit’ it to Parliament."

Lembah Pantai MP Fahmi Fadzil wants Datuk Saifuddin Abdullah to resign over his handling of the National Film Development Corporation Malaysia (Finas) issue today, as this is the third purported gaffe by the communications and multimedia minister since his appointment in March.
He cited Saifuddin’s non-answer to questions by Kluang MP Wong Shu Qi on whether users of social media platforms like TikTok need a Finas licence as well as his own question on whether documentary creator Dustin Pfundheller obtained a Finas licence for his well-received documentary Other Side of the Truth which was shared by national news agency Bernama.
Instead, Saifuddin, earlier tonight, after much backlash from the public, said the Perikatan Nasional (PN) government has no intention of obstructing personal freedom on social media over his remark that all film producers must get a licence from Finas. He added that the ministry is looking to amend outdated laws.
“The YB Minister should have raised these arguments, especially the intention to amend the Act, in his answer to the Dewan Rakyat this morning,” Fahmi said in his statement."

“Therefore, I am of the view that the latest statement by the Honourable Minister intends to ‘find a way out’ to soothe the anger of netizens. And most unfortunate, his statement in fact still does not clearly state that a Finas licence is not required by social media users on platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, and so on.
Fahmi, who is also PKR’s spokesman on communications, arts and culture, said this is not the only gaffe made by Saifuddin since taking over the ministerial position in March this year.
He cited the latter’s withdrawal of Eric Paulsen’s appointment to the Communications and Multimedia Consultative Council and the revocation of the broadband line spectrum."

Earlier today, Saifuddin said all productions of films and recording — whether by media agencies or individual media outlets — must apply for a licence before commencing.
He said under the Finas Act, film producers are required to inform the corporation via existing channels seven days prior to filming, and this even includes media meant for social media platforms."

The issue was brought up after Saifuddin said his ministry will check if Al Jazeera had obtained a licence from Finas to produce the documentary before it started production, saying that a lack of licence would be considered an offence as permission from Finas is needed before films and documentaries can be produced in Malaysia.
He said that the Information Department will cancel Al Jazeera’s media accreditation if it was found to have violated such conditions, noting that the crew would not be free to go anywhere without the media cards issued by the department.
Yesterday, the Foreign Correspondents Club of Malaysia (FCCM) said it was unaware of any requirement to obtain permission from Finas for any news video production, and there was no such issue in the past."

Then the “minister” said when the National Film Development Corporation Act 1981 was enacted, the “social media” phenomenon had not happened so the Act is now inadequate to cover this new phenomena. But yet, he wanted the act to be enforced on all social media videos. Isn’t this a moronic stand, Mr “Minister”? You know fully well the Act is totally inadequate to cover the social media videos and yet you try to to say all handphone videos need a license from Finas. You are basically saying everyone in Malaysia who owns a handphone and who takes a video shot once a while requires a licence from Finas. Not only that, the person need to have a “Sendirian Berhad” company. So does it mean that , if a person does not have a “Sendirian Berhad” company, the person cannot take any video using a handphone? It is common for 8 year-old kids who own handphones to take videos nowadays. How do they apply for filming licenses, given that they are 8 years old? Care to give an explanation, Mr Finas Minister?"

According to Saifuddin, who cited the National FIlm Development Corporation Act 1982, Section 22(1), said “no person shall participate in any production activities, distribute and exhibit films or any combination the activities specified in Section 21(1) unless a licence is issued authorising him to do so”."

The news outlet has since dismissed claims by Finas that it did not have the necessary licence to film or air its documentary on the alleged mistreatment of migrants in Malaysia.

lock myself in a room with an attached bathroom? Yes .. that would be possible if my house was big enough. Unfortunately not many of our houses are big enough and made worst if there are many people staying in that house.
Perhaps, it would be better to check into a hotel with an attached bath room and call for food delivery. That would be a possibility if I can afford it and the hotel understands the risks of having me there.
Unfortunately not many of us can afford it. We may need to be qurantined because of PUI tracing and because we are rich enough to return from overseas.
Added to that is the ignorance of how infectious this virus can spread or how deadly it could be to the aged in the house.
What I am trying to get at is that unless the government has prepared quarantine centers we will not be able to contain the spread of this virus. Furthermore, people in quarantine still do not understand that they need to stay there and not wander into town for teh tarik. Barbed wire fencing and an armed sentry with the instruction to shoot if necessary might be necessary to drive home the seriousness of quarantine. Another possibility for those who escape quarantine would be solitary confinement in a prison for another 14 days.
I have still not gone home to visit my parents till now. Although I am classified as low risk it does not mean by some carelessness on my part, I am infected and being asymptomatic. infect my beloved parents."

Zooming into the weekly chart, ARBB can be seen to have broken out of a triangle consolidation pattern with a potential target price (TP) of around RM0.4
An inverse head and shoulder may also be seen on the daily chart with a breakout point of around RM 0.275 which is supported by the MA9 and a potential TP beyond the RM0.4 level.
Conclusion
Taking into consideration all the pictures painted on the various time frames, ARBB may be retesting the RM0.5 level. RM 0.4 may be seen as a potential resistance area though. Immediate support can be taken at the RM 0.275 area with a final support of RM 0.1."

KUALA LUMPUR (June 23): Malaysia leads other countries in Southeast Asia in the usage of mobile/digital wallets at 40%, ahead of the Philippines (36%), Thailand (27%) and Singapore (26%), according to a Mastercard Impact Study 2020.
As the Malaysia market edition results showed, Covid-19, which led to wide movement restrictions, had driven momentum in Southeast Asia towards the digital economy by necessitating rapid adoption of e-commerce, digital payments and preference for online activities.
The report indicated that even as countries in the region start to ease the restrictions and prepare for a ‘new normal’, some of the trends and habits formed in response to the pandemic would likely remain.
The inputs were gathered from 10,000 consumers and/or business professionals across 10 markets in the Asia Pacific region.
Nearly half of the consumers surveyed in Malaysia reported an increase in online shopping during the period. Other online activities also saw heightened interest, such as surfing the Internet for news and entertainment (75%), online video streaming (57%), social networking (55%) and home delivery of food or groceries (50%).
Additionally, about 64% of Malaysians said they will conduct online shopping in the same frequency as currently or before the pandemic, even after restrictions are lifted.
Similarly, consumers expect to continue home deliveries (54%) and working from home (45%).
Malaysian consumers also shifted to other payment methods other than mobile/digital wallet, such as contactless debit cards (26%) and contactless credit cards (22%), while cash usage declined 64% since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand also reduced their cash usage by 67%, 64% and 59% respectively, with a similar uptick seen in use among all contactless payment methods.
Malaysia’s digital activities especially online shopping and usage of digital payments, were also higher in comparison to other markets in Southeast Asia.
In April, consumers in Malaysia were doing 18% more cashless payments including mobile and QR payments, as compared to 16% in the Philippines, 15% in Singapore, and 15% in Thailand.
On the contactless cards (both debit and credit), Malaysia tied with Singapore with approximately 24% of consumers in both markets saying they were using contactless payments more.
Meanwhile, Southeast Asia Emerging Markets, Mastercard division president Safdar Khan said the company was committed to using the power of data to enable businesses of all sizes to adapt and evolve alongside consumers’ changing needs, preferences and behaviours through e-commerce tools, increasing contact less payment limits, and spearheading the shift to contactless across the region.

A new index focused on China’s technology giants is set to give investors greater access to their growing dominance in Hong Kong’s market.
The Hang Seng Tech Index, which launched Monday with backdated prices, tracks the 30 largest tech companies listed in the city, including Tencent Holdings Ltd., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Meituan Dianping and Xiaomi Corp. Tracking the gauge this year would have returned 47% for investors, versus a loss of 12% for the Hang Seng Index. The tech measure rose 0.8% Monday.
“All the conditions are now ready for large China tech stocks whether in China or already listed elsewhere,” Vincent Kwan, chief executive officer of index compiler Hang Seng Indexes Co., said on Bloomberg Television Monday.
The move comes at a time when further listings of Chinese technology firms are in the pipeline, such as Jack Ma’s Ant Group, following those of NetEase Inc. and JD.com Inc. Listing closer to home has become more attractive as tensions between Washington and Beijing threaten to curtail Chinese companies’ access to U.S. capital markets."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=287","Jul 27, 2020 10:00 AM","SonGokuSSJ5","The compiler of the Hang Seng Index has already embraced change through moves such as scrapping a weighting limit for dual-class shares on some of its gauges. The tech index is seen helping investors bridge a gap between a Hong Kong benchmark overstuffed with old economy banks and insurers, and the technology companies that have emerged as big winners in the city’s beaten-down market.
“There are too many laggards in the Hang Seng Index,” said Castor Pang, head of research at Core Pacific-Yamaichi International Hong Kong. “With overseas-listed Chinese firms deciding to list closer-to-home, the Hong Kong market falls short in terms of having a representative index for these stocks. This new index serves to fill this gap and drive capital flows.”
Citi analysts led by Pierre Lau wrote in a recent note that the index will attract investors to other Hong Kong tech stocks, facilitate the issuance of index-linked funds and derivatives as well as boost turnover at Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. That stock is up 42% this year, most in the Hang Seng Index.
Supported by strong mainland inflows through stock connect links, Chinese technology shares have emerged as big winners in Hong Kong this year. Tencent has surged 41% while Meituan is up 87%."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=287","Jul 27, 2020 10:00 AM","SonGokuSSJ5","The Hang Seng Index, on the other hand, has underperformed. It’s fallen 12% this year, with half of its members down at least 20%.
Morgan Stanley sees the new technology gauge providing a bigger sentiment boost near-term to the MSCI China Index than the Hang Seng, which has few components that will also be in the tech index. “The direct stock-level positives cannot translate into a meaningful index-level boost,” analysts led by Laura Wang wrote."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=287","Jul 27, 2020 10:13 AM","TipTopJoe","新年伊始，一场突如其来的新冠病毒疫情，彻底打乱了人们工作、生活、沟通交流的方式，全国人民举国同心、众志成城，通过各种方式投入到战“疫”当中，获得了巨大的成效。而在这场战“疫”行动中，远程办公模式成为响应国家防控号召、保护员工健康、保证企业复工复产的重要方式，成为疫情期间的一种“新常态”。
众所周知，远程办公解决方案离不开IT基础架构的支撑，由于此次疫情下 90%以上的企业开启了全员在家办公模式，且超过60%的远程办公用户为新用户，大量且集中的远程应用和数据访问带来了高并发需求，而大部分企业的IT基础架构并未做好远程访问的准备，这使得无论是支撑钉钉、Zoom，还是支撑企业内部办公软件的IT基础架构带来了严峻的挑战，数据存储空间不足、应用程序响应时间变慢、视频会议连接卡顿、系统无法远程登陆等等事故频发，严重影响了办公的效率。
面对挑战，企业必须对IT基础架构进行升级改造，构建更加灵活、敏捷和高可用、高安全的架构，能够根据并发用户数量增加，实时、按需弹性扩展，以提高远程响应时间，保证用户的使用体验，确保办公效率。
据了解，由于远程办公在疫情期间有了巨大幅度的增长，所以各家企业对数据中心进行了扩容，以解决高并发数据流量和数据存储的挑战。例如钉钉通过阿里云连续扩容十几万台云服务器，腾讯会议连续8天扩容超过10万台云主机，这也直接导致了存储产品需求的提升。
此外，今年3月份国家发布大力发展“新基建”的举措，让新兴产业的建设不断提速。加之，远程办公带来的在线业务猛增，数据爆涨，使得服务器、存储等受到了不小的压力，这也使得企业对于服务器和存储产品需求量的大幅增长。
可以说，在疫情推动下，存储需求量将持续增长，存储市场长期被看好。
在企业IT基础架构的升级改造过程中，如何根据不同的办公应用需求，选择适合的存储产品，提高效率并降低IT的整体成本，也至关重要。
我们知道，根据存储介质的不同，目前主流的存储产品主要有SSD(固态硬盘)和HDD(机械硬盘)两种。SSD在读写速度、响应时间方面有着巨大的优势，但存储容量较低，且价格较高，比较适合部署应用程序，以提高远程访问的速度；HDD虽然读写速度和响应时间不如SSD，但存储容量更高，价格更低，更适合存储海量数据。
如果企业将各种应用程序部署到数据中心中，并通过虚拟桌面的方式提供给员工使用，那么建议选择SSD产品，以保证在高并发的情况下提供更高的性能，降低延迟。如果企业员工在使用虚拟桌面或远程办公软件时，仅仅是为了数据共享、数据存储等，那么选择HDD即可满足您的需求，且拥有更高的容量和更低的成本。
当然，企业在改造升级IT基础架构时，可以根据不同的需求选择不同的存储产品，搭建混合存储架构，以不同的产品满足不同业务的需求，这样也有助于在提高远程办公效率的同时降低成本，提升员工工作体验。
总结：疫情之下，在职场人士和企业机构快速地融入到远程办公的新常态中，如何提高工作效率，及时地访问企业数据，互相协同，已经成为企业关注重点。面对新办公模式的转变，大部分企业IT基础架构并未充分准备好，改造升级势在必行。当然，在升级改造的过程中，HDD存储产品，即满足了数据密集型工作负载和应用中关键数据的访问，又提供了高密度的存储容量，以丰富的产品选择和更低的成本，为数据中心升级改造赋能，为企业远程办公赋能。"

""Both the IoT & ERP markets will exhibit double digit growth with adoption being driven from across industry verticals.""
Given the company's unique business model (to those who do not understand and cry, please move on), P/E of 4 times is an understatement; should the company increase it's valuation from more investment bank to 6 - 7 times, stock price easily RM 0.50 - RM 0.60.. You want to buy at that time?

---- RECAP ----
All talking cock here, anyone of you really understand the ERP business model?
While Caravan Capital Management LLC increasing stakes to 5.95% shareholder, you guys can hold on to your penny stock lah ..
With MCO in mind, the company should achieve RM 6 - 7 Million net profit in the upcoming quarter; hence the newly adjusted P/E ratio should still be 4 times only ..
You want to find P/E 4 times P/E counter in Malaysia with growing ERP and IoT segment? Good luck lo, even MIDF given target of RM 0.510, I welcome you to use facts to challenge me"

Suppression usually is to make people frustrated...The complains about ""Fatty Liew"" is understandable. If you look back the quarter 1 once announcement released, it went downhill all the way for around 2-3 months. So understandable people will be angry because other penny stocks goreng up but this one go down. Then come yesterday around same pattern happens and those have been holding they even get more agitated. So you can see these people will tell you this is a con man counter and these are the people at a huge paper loss. Then when they can't tahan the price go down again, the would sell and book in realised loss. But what they don't understand it the more you spread all these negative things ""Fatty Liew"" would be more than happy to keep buying from you at a cheap price. All substantial shareholders always want their shares to go up, no matter what it is. From my point of view, it's just that ""Fatty Liew"" collect not enough and thanks to short term people who thought they got ""played"" ""Fatty Liew"" is more than happy. He's just playing on your emotion. Wealth is often transferred from the impatient to the patient.The huge volume yesterday means something is up.

Or it is you're the one who sell it down to make the share price down and spread all the negativity? Maybe he got try to push but you guys keep selling down, you tell me lor, if you're ""Fatty Liew"" you want to push up but people keep dumping you still want to help push it up or not? And people keep cursing you everyday haha. Maybe if you praise him once a while then his mood good maybe he will start pushing?

- 提供ERP软件和智能物联网系统。
早些时候意识到单靠ERP系统的销售无法带来持续性，于是决定转变成“利润共享”模式，也就是免费提供系统给予客户，然后从他们的销售抽取利润；长期可带来持续性收入。
举个例子，涉及手机配件零售业务的客户Yes’s Comm，虽然在营业额方面持续取得增长，但是早期因为在采购库存方面缺乏系统，进而导致太多囤货无法出售，被迫进行注销；在采用ERP系统后，整体业务流程获得改善，变得更加有效率。
以往购买系统的客户一般上以中小型企业为主；他们鲜少愿意投资在系统上，毕竟不确定能否回本；在推出“利润共享”模式后，客户们无需再使用一分钱，形成双赢局面。
然而，如果客户们的销售持续下滑，即时免费提供系统也没有意义；会先参考他们的以往表现和现金流，才决定是否要进行合作，要不然一切免谈。事实上，这项模式的条件还蛮苛刻，先给予3个月试用期，如果客户们不答应利润共享条件，就立即取消合作。
竞争优势方面，本地不是每一家软件业者都会投入大笔资金进行研发，而且每个ERP系统的素质也不一样；前后投入大约RM10m资本开销才创造这个系统，大部分耗资在Source Code。
现阶段2项最主要的合约是Yes’s Comm，产品价值 (GMV)大约是RM20m，以及柬埔寨的Tatan Land，产品价值 (GMV)至少为RM84m；值得一提，仅抽取产品出售后的部分利润，而非全部；个人认为，之前公布的通告有意误导投资者。
至于旗下一些智能家居系统合约，与承包商在产业项目的初期阶段作出规划；以往本地的智能系统都是在房产建成后才进行安装，不过却必须涉及一些不菲的装修费用；作为对比，在初期阶段仅需要RM5,000就可完成，不过在建成后即使耗资RM20,000也未必赚钱。
近期已竞标数项IoT项目，其中包括政府关联TNB和Petronas的合约、以及ECRL的通讯系统项目；预计来临Q4可录得更高的业绩表现。
展望2020年，目标是将盈利翻倍；已向交易所申请，明年转向科技板块，到时希望市场重新评估。
未来计划脱售旗下一家公司的股权，并以借壳上市的方式完成，借此为股东们创造更大的价值，前提是业务达到一定的规模；如果无法达到，会考虑透过收购来壮大。
总结，ARBB现阶段PE仅是4倍，理论上称得上低估。然而，这会是价值陷阱吗？首选，今年几乎全数列认的营业额都无法收取账款；管理层给出的解释也显得没有说服力，甚至还说往后应收账款会进一步提高。
第二点，为何柬埔寨和中国企业会转向使用大马的软件系统公司？众所周知，这个行业的竞争非常大，而且持续性低。故事说得再动人，未来前景再好，也难以说服市场。切记不要被公布的合约价值误导！
第三点，市场上优先股数量高达800m+，每当母股价格走高，就会有人行使，然后在市场上卖出。股价要走高的难度可想而知。
纯属分享！

London biscuits for eg written off more than 300 million receivables but no actions taken against auditors, management and bod. This encourages other companies to follow. Binapuri, most of its profit attributable to non controlling interest or most losses absorbed by SHs without sufficient disclosure on rationale. Massive written off in one quarter is another ridiculous matter as things can't just turned bad within a quarter unless fire without insurance cover etc.
Poor disclosure standards, poor regulatory regime who know best to enquire on unusual price movement instead of auto-reporting, absence of receivables aging etc.

From a timber/wood manufacturer; suddenly 360 change into IR4.0 company. Issue 1.4bil ICPS at 0.01sen. 20sen to convert into a share. After converting, still get free 5-6sen per share by selling open market. Why go buy premium at 27-28sen. The fair value should be 21sen. Why wanna benefit them by buying high? Currently, converted about 200mil shares, got 1.2billion shares yet to be converted. Own subsidiary ARBIOT that report 35mil earnings by increasing trade receivables by 40mil to support 1.2Bil shares diluting EPS. Currently at PE 2, what a way to set value trap. You can read from Q4,18 quarters until last quarter reports. You will agree with me.

At the rate of dilution and , maintaining EPS 0.5 also a problem. I will consider if QR announce more LOA; NOT FROM BUDDY BUDDY COMPANY. (The only LOA they have now is from associated company ahem -ahem company - that's more like cooking the book than doing legit business) Else it will be another Anzo scam. All trade receivables from buddy company jack the EPS up but never translate into cash generated from operation.

I have seriously no ideas What's wrong with those fake account spammer. 9 to 6 gone then tomorrow making noise again and again. Again as a smart investor . Hopefully you guys see through your eyes. Either this is good counter.
Smart investor put eye sight on long term. Arbb is on transforming and we can see the strong based on arbb. Seriously think twice , if a company manage to hold and having a green qr is pretty good. Unfortunately those spammer keep attacking and making fun with the name.
From iot to erp, and energy system . Which is really cool business structure. Try imagine to the combination of iot and construction and the possibility on this business.
Instead of attacking the counter why not spend your self to study ? Learn to be smart investor and comfort your mentality."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=312","Aug 26, 2020 12:30 AM","tankoksiong","Dividends
Please don't ask me why this stupid Company don't give dividends? Hello, if Company is expanding rapidly and experiencing growth they won't give you dividends one la. Why? Give you dividends already how to grow fast? Company that give you dividends in general they are quite stable and most of them are rarely expanding. Take BAT as an example, not only its not expanding its performance have been terrible. I take the most easy example so you can understand.
So everything seems good with a little risk? But why a lot of people say this is a con man counter? Oh because always goreng tak jadi? Volume a lot but cannot move one?
This you need to ask the existing holders. I will tell you in summary why this Company cannot move up.
1. Complains about auditor not doing their job well. I myself had uncovered a fraud case when I'm an auditor and the director go to jail because of that. Then I ask you one thing. Why my name is not well know one ah? If your Company got fraud case, you want to publish in newspaper one ah my friend? Of course you low profile as possible, otherwise who dare do business with you? You always see in news those news that say auditor never do job well, but I tell you how many cases we caught do you even know? Audit fee for ARBB is around RM68k in total and RM36k for non audit services. Total is only around RM100k. For such a low audit fee, the partner signing the account want to risk his/her reputation? ARBB is audited by RSM which is a respectable mid tier firm. You go ask auditors if every year their work in the same Company they auditng increase or decrease please? And I tell you auditor have lots of compliance thing to comply to.
2. The quality of the investor and shareholders. An example, glove counter investors always concern about earnings first. Share price is never an issue. ARBB investors? Day in day out complain why share price don't increase although earnings is good. There is a difference in this, maybe if you look it's the same but its not. If you have a lot of investor the character is panic sell one, do you think your share can go up? A bit a bit of drop they go throw all of their shares. You tell me. And please don't underestimate idiots ok. They may be idiots, but you never know it can be that they are very rich. Maybe good in doing certain things but just when come to shares they suck. Don't underestimate this group. Idiots sometimes can be rich while you how intelligent you are might be a poor person. Sometimes no logic but my friend that's reality.
Mentality of the existing investors need to educate them and create awareness to them, accept it or not it is really up to them. I can't change them. What I can do is to write an article to create awareness. That's the only thing within my power. If you ask me how long I took to understand the whole Company, it's two days."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=312","Aug 26, 2020 12:30 AM","tankoksiong","What you can do if you're looking at this Company as a long term good share?
1. Educate people by sharing this article, so they will know this Company inside out. If you see people in KLSE screener, OMG I can tell you what they write is really funny. Absolutely zero knowledge about this Company.
2. Patient, patient and patient
I'm writting to give more informed facts to potential true investors, to look into the potential of this Company. By attracting good quality investor who are informed then I can expect the share price to go up in the future. If I try to keep telling people buy buy buy there is no use. The share price won't move due to the quality of investor/shareholders of inferior quality. Everyday also so negative, how it bring good to the share?
Another thing is the operator for this counter is brutal. To understand this you need to see when this new shareholder come in to the Company and from then you see the pattern of chart. If you see 2 May 2019 at the top, this operator know how to push one. The thing is they have frustate a lot of people by 2 quarter consecutively after it is out the share start dropping. It seems they are accumulating at a certain range and push a bit make people panic. You can open the chart and see for yourself if you have time. You can see a lot of angry people due to this. Because the people behave like this everytime panic sell the operator happily follow the same method. Until your mindset change, then maybe the operator will be confused a bit. Ikan bilis not always will lose to shit head operator like that, you need to change a bit of strategy.
3. Buy as low as you can to be safe. The upside is tremendous if you believe in ARBB."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=312","Aug 26, 2020 12:30 AM","tankoksiong","Conclusion:
In any investment decision made, confirm there is a risk present. You drive on the road also got risk, you take flight also got risk. Risk is always present. What is important is put all facts together and see from that angle. Make your own decision and I wish you all the best. Please bear in mind, think carefully and rationally, don't just accept what I write, you must always be sceptical. You guys are awesome, in your own way.
PS: My comments are removed on 14/8/2020 if you guys realised. Normal conversation being removed, meaning a few things:
1. The operator saw my article and comments and paid i3investor to remove those comments made.
2. Negative people complain for whatever reason making my comments and few others dissapear.
3. And FYI people who keep spreading negative things are the one who are not helping anything about the stock. Why would you sell when the fundamental are good? Even if you buy high, when you sell is confirmed is you're already make losses. Just see those who make comments asking ARBB to drop more.
4. Since my comments are removed, I will surely buy more since certain people do not like what I did. What I did is just write 3 articles of facts.
Re-read my 3 articles to make sure you have a strong convinction and confidence.

I had invested in the company since 2018. I had witnessed the ups and downs of the company, the exponential growth and dramatic change in business model. As an investor of the company myself, I have to clarify something extremely sad and hard truth about the company.
The truth is, after days of investigations, we had confirmed that the accounts that are attacking ARBB comes from a similar group of people. So one might think, surely these people had too much time on their hand aye?
No. There's the furthest from the truth.
The truth is, these people are investors and / or traders of ARBB themselves. So why are they attacking the company / new management?
It's simple. There's people are collecting the shares of ARBB at strong support level (If you noticed the trend of ARBB, the company's share price has been moving in a very tight range), and dispose it simultaneously when they spread negativity in this forum.
You can match the time of large disposal of shares and the timing of negative comments.
They had done this numerous times, and although I hate to admit it, but these people do influence new investors. So, I really like to thank people who stand up for ARBB, my salute to you, who is insightful and intelligent enough to not get swayed by such attacks.
These group of people had been reported to 2 entity, namely the MCMC and SC. So, I hope they would do something soon. But if they don't (Or they simply can't), we will have to stand out and keep reminding investors to stay away from the negative comments and focus on the growth prospects of the company.
Again, with ARBB's recent 4 quarters of cumulative RM 36.40 Million, them having a market cap of RM 135 Million is not an understatement, but ultra-undervalued.
So, let's fight against these manipulators of share price and let the market discover the true value of ARBB!"

Dear shareholders / investors of ARB Berhad (7181),
I had invested in the company since 2018. I had witnessed the ups and downs of the company, the exponential growth and dramatic change in business model. As an investor of the company myself, I have to clarify something extremely sad and hard truth about the company.
The truth is, after days of investigations, we had confirmed that the accounts that are attacking ARBB comes from a similar group of people. So one might think, surely these people had too much time on their hand aye?
No. There's the furthest from the truth.
The truth is, these people are investors and / or traders of ARBB themselves. So why are they attacking the company / new management?
It's simple. There's people are collecting the shares of ARBB at strong support level (If you noticed the trend of ARBB, the company's share price has been moving in a very tight range), and dispose it simultaneously when they spread negativity in this forum.
You can match the time of large disposal of shares and the timing of negative comments.
They had done this numerous times, and although I hate to admit it, but these people do influence new investors. So, I really like to thank people who stand up for ARBB, my salute to you, who is insightful and intelligent enough to not get swayed by such attacks.
These group of people had been reported to 2 entity, namely the MCMC and SC. So, I hope they would do something soon. But if they don't (Or they simply can't), we will have to stand out and keep reminding investors to stay away from the negative comments and focus on the growth prospects of the company.
Again, with ARBB's recent 4 quarters of cumulative RM 36.40 Million, them having a market cap of RM 135 Million is not an understatement, but ultra-undervalued.
So, let's fight against these manipulators of share price and let the market discover the true value of ARBB!"

Author: jvjason5292 | Publish date: Tue, 1 Sep 2020, 1:12 AM
Below are the excerpts from Frost & Sullivan analysis, I thought that it would be quite a good read for new investors to understand more about ERP and IoT sector. And of course - ARB BERHAD (7181)
ARB’s key strengths include its design and development capabilities that allow it to create ERP solutions from the ground up – allowing it to craft highly customized systems that can cater to the varied needs of different industries, from retail to agriculture. In this way, ARB is able to cater to the specific needs of its target customer, who typically have very unique requirements with respect to system dashboards, customer support and applications & modules.
With the experience gained from its JVs, ARB has a better appreciation of the requirements that users (business manager etc.) deployed on the ground have. It has therefore been able to tailor its ERP portfolio to be highly aligned to the challenges that SMEs typically face which include:
Improving management integration;
Gaining oversight on the costs and benefits from various business activities;
Engaging in data-driven strategic planning;
Instituting strict financial control measures;
ARB’s ERP solutions are also highly scalable according to the needs of its customers (particularly SMEs) especially in the following areas;
Incorporating machine learning, AI and data analytics tools to automate operations, business intelligence and marketing purposes;
Achieving integrated supply chain management with a focus on visibility over warehouses and inventory;
Accommodating multi-level membership/referral programmes;
Integrating e-wallet solutions in retail systems;
Optimizing backend operations to improve operational efficiencies; and
Possessing the versatility required to handle operations across a wide range of industries.
So, can other companies adopt what ARBB is doing? The short answer is no. ARBB's unique business model disable most, if not all close competitors in the ERP sector.
Here's another excerpt from the Frost & Sullivan analysis.
ARB approaches target SMEs (typically with a long track record of growth over 10-15 years) in the distribution and service industries who are in the early stages of their digital transformation journey to form joint ventures (JVs). These SMEs typically do not possess the funds or risk appetite to implement costly ERP solutions and are also facing operational and management inefficiencies that place a ceiling on their growth.
The JV takes over the business operations of the SME – with the SME focusing on sales and inventory management and ARB (with the controlling interest) financing and operating a customized ERP solution and periodically providing the necessary updates and new modules, freeing up cash flow for the SME in a mutually beneficial relationship. Beyond SMEs, ARB also uses similar JV models in projects with government linked companies (GLCs).
ARB creates value for its JV partner by providing a solution (based on its technical/business know-how) designed to generate an immediate impact on sales and profits. ARB also improves business outcomes for its network of JV partners by allowing its network of partners to cross-sell their products and/or upsell packages to end customers.
This innovative business model addresses three major pain points for customers and vendors in the ERP market
Customers, particularly SMEs, being unwilling to spend on costly ERP implementation (by essentially shifting from a cash/debt driven model of technology investment to an equity-based model of technology investment.)
ERP systems becoming obsolete or unfit for customers’ changing business needs (by ensuring that the motives of the technology provider and the client are aligned via a profit-sharing model – incentivizing the technology vendor to develop a better understanding of customer requirements and provide periodic upgrades and adjustments)
Failure of outcome-based models as vendors have very limited levers to influence performance (by giving the technology provider direct managerial oversight to ensure that its ERP solution is being implemented alongside optimal business and workflow processes)"

Part Satu - Intro Ages 7145
Kepada Ahli Lembaga Pengarah Prinsiptek / Ageson,
Saya ingin bertanya kepada kalian...
mengapa kalian sanggup bertindak sebegitu
kejam sehingga menjadikan orang awam yang
tidak tahu menahu dalam urusan syarikat
kalian sebagai mangsa untuk kepentingan
kalian sendiri???
Baru-baru ini, saya dapat tahu salah seorang
rakan saya terlibat dalam kes
“curian identiti”. Pada mulanya saya
rasa ini hanyalah kes tipuan biasa
sahaja....tetapi setelah diteliti,
ianya merupakan kes kecurian identiti
di mana nama rakan saya telah diguna pakai
sebagai Pengarah dan Pemegang Saham di
4 syarikat di bawah!!
- Prinsiptek (M) Sdn Bhd
- LKD Trading Sdn Bhd
- NBL Land Development Sdn Bhd
- Tanah Perangsang Sdn Bhd
Bagus kan!, Tiba-tiba menjadi pengarah dan
pemegang saham di dalam syarikat-syarikat
di atas.
Malangnya...syarikat-syarikat ini
telah disaman oleh banyak syarikat
lain berjumlah jutaan ringgit!!!
Carian SSM menunjukkan bahawa
syarikat-syarikat ini adalah bekas anak
syarikat anda, Ageson Berhad
(Dahulunya sebagai Prinsiptek Corporation
Berhad), dan pemeriksaan lebih lanjut
menunjukkan bahawa Ageson Berhad diambil
alih oleh 2 orang yang bernama Chin Kok Foong
dan Liew Kok Leong (Nampaknya dia adalah
seorang berpangkat Dato, tetapi saya
enggan menyebutnya sebagai Dato kerana
sememangnya sudah pasti dia tidak layak).
Setelah pengambilalihan, kalian telah
mencuri identiti rakan saya dan memindahkan
saham dan menjadikan beliau sebagai
pengarah anak syarikat anda kepadanya
dan menjadikannya mangsa.
Sebenarnya sangat jelas menunjukkan bahawa
kalian (Ageson Berhad) cuba berusaha untuk
melepaskan diri dari semua saman pemiutang
dengan hanya memindahkan saham dan jawatan
pengarah kepada mangsa...segala hutang-hutang
kalian tidak perlu membayar satu sen pun,
tetapi rakan saya sebagai pengarah perlu
menghadapi semua tuntutan dan gangguan oleh
pemiutang anda.
Kalian ni sememangnya penipu yang
paling berani untuk tidak menghiraukan
undang-undang Malaysia.
Oleh kerana kes ini melibatkan reputasi
pasaran saham Malaysia dan reputasi agensi
penguatkuasaan Malaysia yang berkaitan,
saya sangat berharap agensi kerajaan yang
berkenaan akan membuat siasatan kes.
Jika tindakan yang sewajarnya tidak diambil,
siapa lagi yang berani menjalankan bisnes di
Malaysia??
Saya terpaksa menyiarkan kes ini dengan akaun
baru demi menjaga keselamatan saya kerana
telah mendedahkan perkara buruk mereka
kepada orang ramai.
Semoga pihak berkuasa mengambil tindakan yang
sewajarnya dan siasat sebelum ramai lagi
yang menjadi mangsa."

Part Dua - Tipu SSM dan Bursa
Kalau tak buat jahat, buat apa mau main back date tukar pengarah, tukar share allotment dan tukar constitution?
Buat apa mau menebus syea keutamaan?
Nasib baik SSM tak bodoh. Semua sudah reject.
Tapi alamak.. announcement Quarterly Results for Financial Period Ended 31 December 2019 yang AGES buat pada 12 Feb 2020 di Bursa Malaysia tu dikira mengandungi kenyataan yang tak betul kan??
SEBAB Item 24 ""Material Litigation"" dia kata ""Pursuant to the dilution of shareholding, Prinsiptek (M) Sdn Bhd become a non -subsidiary of the Company. The Material litigation in relation to Prinsiptek (M) Sdn Bhd is not compulsory to bd disclosed""
Tapi Mana ada dilution ? SSM sampai hari in tunjuk lagi AGES hold Prinsiptek 90% syer.
Pening niii.... saya yang tak tau baca repor, ke orang jahat terlalu handal?

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=323","Sep 2, 2020 4:30 PM","ThunderStorm","Part Tiga - Ageson Financial Analysis and Comments
Untuk membantu “Retail Investor” yang mungkin terpedaya oleh cybertroopers yang diupah Ageson, saya telah menjemput rakan saya yang sedang mengambil kursus perakaunan untuk memberi komen mengenai Quarterly Results Ageson.
So here is the sharing of my friend’s analysis of Ageson Berhad financials, news, and company announcements since 1 July 2019, this analysis is also used for his school project. The analysis has been mainly focusing on the construction business and have not covered the new sand business to large extent as this will be updated again in future. Selection criteria of Company to analyse included the following but not limited to:
1. Company receiving multiple queries from Bursa
2. Penny stocks which share price increased significantly since Covid-19
3. Company in construction business
Feel free to comment. Need guidance to improvise the analysis.
1. Revenue, Cost of Sales and Gross Profit
- Q2 Revenue increased by 105%, but Cost of Sales reduced by 11%? What kind of construction business can possibly bill for higher Revenue with reduction in Cost? Please explain what Construction Revenue Recognition Method is use.
- Cumulated Gross Profit Margin was handsome at 57% for Q4. Such results during this Covid-19 period surpasses all leading construction listed company in Malaysia with average GP of 20%, and even surpass all leading development listed company in Malaysia with average GP od 30%. Really wonder which project continued operation during MCO can generate 36m revenue for Ageson.
- Some people say they sell sand that’s why so high profit, but based on Q4 Report, Item 9 Segmental Information, seems like no sand transaction was done yet. The reported Segment was only for Construction and Property Development.
2. Expenses
- Operating Expenses. Sudden jump of 14.3m (20.5m – 6.2m) in Q3. Probably Ageson expanded incredibly during Covid-19 and MCO lockdown period in March 2020, just that they deem insignificant and do not need to make announcement on this since everyone busy coping with Covid-19? Miracally, Q4 operating expenses suddenly dropped by 7m as “Operating Income”. Impressive, as every company were busy cutting down operating expenses while Ageson manage to actually generate operating income.
- Finance Cost. The finance cost come and go as if they own the bank. Notwithstanding that Q4 has outstanding bank borrowings of 21.6m, but zero finance cost? Did we miss any interest-free financing package available in the market?
- Share of Associated Company Results. Only Q4 got associated Company and other quarters no Associated Company? No where in the announcements have mentioned about the associated Company.
- Tax. So much profit but no Provision for Tax? A closer look at both Income Statement and Balance Sheet shows that there were no single cent of tax expense or tax provision made.
Does it mean that those “Revenue” and “Profits” are non-operating in nature, i.e. purely paper profits, and hence not taxable?
Could it be due to capital gain? Unsure as no disclosure of material capital gain made.
Or did we miss any new special tax exemption scheme by the Malaysia government?
Analysis of Balance Sheet (Assets):
To simplify things, lets focus on the changes between June 2020 and June 2019 only, instead of by Quarter:
1. Many movements in the various accounts under Non Current Asset, but ultimately, Non Current Asset increased by 41m, which coincidentally, Goodwill has also increased by 41m. Have we missed any major acquisition by Ageson which resulted in Goodwill recognition? Is Ageson a Billion dollar company whereby such increase of 41M goodwill does not warrant a disclosure of the source?
2. Goodwill increase of RM 41m was almost equivalent to the nett decrease in Net Current Asset of 40.5m.
3. Increase in total Equity of 17.6m was also almost equivalent to the decrease of Non-Current Liabilities of 17m.
Summary:
4. Where did the Net Profit of RM 37m went to? For operating profit, Net-Current Asset should have increased by 37m. Profit of 37m and recognition of Goodwill for 41m? Hmmm….Debit Goodwill, Credit Revenue? Magic…
5. Furthermore, where did the cash from Preference Share of 48m went to? Increase in Equity should also follow by increase in Asset if all else remain constant.
6. What is more surprising is, reserves had actually decreased by 103m. So lets look at the Q3 Statement of Changes in Equity Below:
7. Is Prinsiptek (M) Sdn Bhd Still A Subsidiary of Ageson?
In Q4 Capital Reserve has reduced substantially by 124,949 under item “Changes of Stakes in a Subsidiary Company”!! There was no announcement of any major disposal or changes in subsidiary from 1 April to 30 June 2020 (or up till 31 August 2020), so how come suddenly there is this huge change?
A careful read of the Q4 result announcement, Item 12 Changes in Composition of the Group, Ageson Berhad reported the following:"

A careful read of the Q4 result announcement, Item 12 Changes in Composition of the Group, Ageson Berhad reported the following:
There were no material changes in the composition of the Group for the current financial quarter under review.
Almost forgotten to mention, Ageson has on 27 December 2019 announced that that Prinsiptek (M) Sdn Bhd (“PMSB”) was a former subsidiary of Ageson. The also Board highlighted that as at 1 July 2019, Prinsiptek (M) Sdn Bhd (“PST”) had ceased to be a principal subsidiary of the Company.
If this is the case, what could it be? Possible misreporting? Only Bursa can investigate and provide us an clearer picture.
8. If Prinsiptek (M) Sdn Bhd is not Subsidiary of Ageson, who delivers the Construction Revenue and Results?
Based on 2019 Annual Report of Prinsiptek Corporation / Ageson Berhad, Prinsiptek (M) Sdn Bhd is a wholly owned subsidiary, and it hold all of the group Construction business.
Prinsiptek Corporation mentioned in the Annual Report page 5 the following:
The Group started with one of its largest and longest established subsidiaries, namely Prinsiptek (M) Sdn Bhd (“PST”), which was incorporated on 18 October 1990 to undertake building and construction activities. PST has grown over the years and is now a Class “A” and Grade G7 registered contractor with the Sijil Perolehan Kerja Kerajaan and the Construction Industry Development Board respectively, allowing PST to bid and undertake construction projects of unlimited value. Furthermore, PST has expanded its business into other related fields such as Turnkey Contractor, Property Developer and Trading House for Construction Raw Materials.
But now since Ageson Berhad already dishonestly (no better words) disown Prinsiptek (M) Sdn Bhd by announcing in Q2 results that Prinsiptek (M) Sdn Bhd became a “non-subsidiary” due to dilution of shares (but yet latest SSM results still shows Ageson holds 92% shares in Prinsiptek (M) Sdn Bhd), so which company is Ageson Berhad Construction Arm?
If Prinsiptek (M) Sdn Bhd is no longer a subsidiary, which entity significantly contributed to the Construction segment revenue and results? Perhaps the other construction related subsidiary listed in the annual report or the 2 new subsidiaries of Ageson Berhad as follows?
1. Ageson Enterprise Sdn Bhd (formerly knowsn as Esa Pile Sdn Bhd)
2. Ageson BIM Sdn Bhd
3. Ageson System Sdn Bhd
However, a quick check on the Malaysia CIDB website today shows that the above companies were not even a registered contractor with CIDB. They don’t even have a G1 licence.
Further Thoughts:
1. As Ageson Berhad had always make announcement on Memorandum of Understanding, Letter of Intent etc whereby all these “ARE NOT COMMITTED PURCHASES”, they will definitely make announcement on new construction projects, be it the first day they met XXX party for the first time with no firm plan and commitment for new projects too right? But so far there was no single announcement on new construction projects, not even a plan. Mystery of the day, what Construction Project is Ageson Berhad working on, and under which entity, contributing to the exceptionally good construction segment revenue and results?
2. Grant Thornton Malaysia (AF 0737) (“GT”) resigned as Auditors of the Company with immediate effect on 6 August 2020, 22 days prior to the deadline for the Company Q4 announcement. Could this be a potential red flag? GT was first appointed as Auditor during the Annual General Meeting held on 25 November 2019. GT has not completed its 1st year audit of the Company.
Thank you and have a nice day…
- To the investor of Ageson Berhad….May the odds be ever in your favor…

In this way, ARB is able to cater to the specific needs of its target customer, who typically have very unique requirements with respect to system dashboards, customer support and applications & modules."

Improving management integration;
Gaining oversight on the costs and benefits from various business activities;
Engaging in data-driven strategic planning;
Instituting strict financial control measures;
ARB’s ERP solutions are also highly scalable according to the needs of its customers (particularly SMEs) especially in the following areas;
Incorporating machine learning, AI and data analytics tools to automate operations, business intelligence and marketing purposes;
Achieving integrated supply chain management with a focus on visibility over warehouses and inventory;
Accommodating multi-level membership/referral programmes;
Integrating e-wallet solutions in retail systems;

These SMEs typically do not possess the funds or risk appetite to implement costly ERP solutions and are also facing operational and management inefficiencies that place a ceiling on their growth.
- The JV takes over the business operations of the SME – with the SME focusing on sales and inventory management and ARB (with the controlling interest) financing and operating a customized ERP solution and periodically providing the necessary updates and new modules, freeing up cash flow for the SME in a mutually beneficial relationship. Beyond SMEs, ARB also uses similar JV models in projects with government linked companies (GLCs).
- ARB creates value for its JV partner by providing a solution (based on its technical/business know-how) designed to generate an immediate impact on sales and profits. ARB also improves business outcomes for its network of JV partners by allowing its network of partners to cross-sell their products and/or upsell packages to end customers.
- This innovative business model addresses three major pain points for customers and vendors in the ERP market
- Customers, particularly SMEs, being unwilling to spend on costly ERP implementation (by essentially shifting from a cash/debt driven model of technology investment to an equity-based model of technology investment.)
- ERP systems becoming obsolete or unfit for customers’ changing business needs (by ensuring that the motives of the technology provider and the client are aligned via a profit-sharing model – incentivizing the technology vendor to develop a better understanding of customer requirements and provide periodic upgrades and adjustments)
- Failure of outcome-based models as vendors have very limited levers to influence performance (by giving the technology provider direct managerial oversight to ensure that its ERP solution is being implemented alongside optimal business and workflow processes)

The scale of IoT deployments can be defined as follows:
- Small scale: Less than 500 connected devices
- Medium scale: 500 – 10,000 connected devices
- Large scale: More than 10,000 connected devices
- ARB has demonstrated its ability to implement large scale IoT deployments, differentiating itself from its competitors who primarily occupy the small and medium scale space, leading it to be perceived as a top-tier IoT system integrator. This allows ARB to compete more effectively against larger players in future large scale implementation projects and secure collaborations with industry-leading players.
- For example, it signed an MoA with Hangzhou Mayam IoT Tech Co Ltd to potentially deploy 300,000 smart water meters (Phase one of the rollout) in a project worth RM 200 million, with ARB handling the installation, commissioning and testing of the water meters.
- It also inked an MoA with Shuifa IoT Tech Co Ltd to supply 300,000 Malaysian households with smart water filtration systems in a project worth RM 600 million."

- For example, it embarked on its foray into the renewable energy segment through its acquisition of C&M Renewable Energy Technology Sdn Bhd in Malaysia allowing it to leverage its capabilities in IoT related system integration and solution engineering in large-scale renewable projects in Malaysia. This acquisition not only supports ARB’s vision of supporting environmental sustainability-related activities, it also allows ARB to be in a strong position to compete in the rapidly growing green energy industry in Malaysia, which is seeking to increase the share of renewable energy sources in the country’s energy mix from 2% in 2018 to 20% in 2025.

If you're also in Bitcoin and alt coins, probably you have heard it long ago. Apparently ARBB is the only proven company in Malaysia for IoT while most others is in testing stage.
About the dilutive shares due to the conversion of ARBB-PA which many people complain including me, there is a positive side actually which is you need to pay RM0.20 to convert, so actually when converting RM200 will go into the bank of the Company per 1,000 shares. But still I myself don't like this, but to be fair you need to write about its positive part also.
Total ARBB-PA is 1,008,150,000 units. So if let's say really to convert all the Company will get RM201,630,000 = RM201.6mil
Let's say really everything converted what we want to know how many shares are there in the case all converted and added up with the normal shares. My calculation is 1,008,150,000 + 67,210,000 = 1,075,360,000 = 1.075 billion shares.
Currently how many shares are there from the Q2 report I got is 368,059,000. So 368,059,000/1.075billion = is 34.22% of the maximum issue size of the maximum possible 1.075billion shares.
So meaning currently as per Q2 they have 34.22% out of the maximum possilbe of 1.075billion. How you want to imagine it is up to you. I have provided the facts here.
In my opinion, if the Company can achieve RM20mil onwards of PAT/quarter, no need to worry about dilutive effect. I go check on Frontken to see the effect on its share. Otherwise every time you need to calculate just to check properly if the EPS is still desirable. Management job now is make sure they go find more contracts and clients and no need to think about dilutive effect of the shares. Another thing is that dilutive effect means your PE will be higher only. Check and see other technology company how much is their P/E. Sometimes, I don't understand why people complaining about dilutive effect when usually when you buy high PE company. The effect actually is the same. On a psychology aspect I think it's worth for me to make a study.
Since you all love to ask and complain about dilutive effect right, why you all never go calculate for glove companies one ah? LOL Try and calculate see, I'll tell you its worse than this company.
Results as follows:
Since becoming an Tech stock it has posted quite impressive results. The only thing I don't like is the dilutive share which keep increasing. This stock I have been looking for quite some time as I'm not sure if it's doing ok. Another reason of looking at it is because due to MCO, in a lot of companies, thing has already changed. Either you adopt technology or you will be out of business. Hence IT solutions like this come in handy as it accelerates the adoption. Either you follow or your company will be out of business due to the change in environment. What in general people know is Glove companies have impressive earnings in our current environment, but a bit of news about vaccine most get panic already. Why is that so? Because people know glove companies is overvalued, and as long as there is the next idiot that keep buying the shares from the previous holder, it will of course still going up. People will keep quiet and not telling people so they could sell it to the next idiot and so on, they know its overvalued, but if my cost is low of course I want to sell high to the next person. Alternatively, we can always as ourselves, what opportunities could present itself in this environment? And start thinking...You can't keep thinking the same way as before because most businesses are traditional type of business. Renewable energy? IoT? Solar power? Something that is disruptive.
News is for entertainment. Reporters and writters from theEdge, the Star, NST, or whatever lar...you really think they know what they're talking about? Sometimes a Company shares can drop without any reason. Then they will write a logic thing to justify it. Most pro is copy+paste. All of that are rubbish my friends. They need to cari makan so have to write things that either please their advertisers, readers etc. but all is bullshit. One more thing is that sometimes you see Bursa like having mini crash because they go amplify the negative news. So its important you have more research and reading. Reading means selective reading, not reading rubbish news and materials that add no value to you."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=324","Sep 2, 2020 4:57 PM","hoot9eonly","Balance Sheet
Bank have RM36 mil and no borowings, cash flow from operations is positive. Please take note that probably no dividends will be available for you as the Company is in its new business thus need to reinvest in its operations. Anyway no big deal no dividends as long as got big capital appreciation.
EPS is 2.3 sen this quarter. Assuming conservative of 1.5sen per quarter thus 6 sen/year
Let's take PE of 10, 6 sen x 10 = 60 sen
And this is a tech stock, so I also don't know why PE for this Company is so low. Another point I wanted to highlight is that the volume is all time high today 12/8/2020.
When looking into a Company like tech stocks a question always need to be asked is moving forward post Covid-19 how our environment would be? Now many people stream live from Facebook everyday to promote and sell their product, some smaller Company resort to remote working place, such as positioning their staff in shared work place etc...Thing are not same anymore. Business got to change or you prepare to be replaced. Covid-19 actually eliminate weaklings and only the strong survive. I think you guys can already see this. Even if you're an SME, it is so important that you sell on Lazada and Shopee itself. You don't setup? Wait to close shop. This time around it is also a good opportuniy to venture to become an entrepreneur. Barrier of entry is low with so much opportunities.
Balance Sheet wise and performance I don't see any issue aside from dillutive shares. Prospect remain bright. Got money in the bank, and they disposed off previous business untill now already become full IT Company. Any other catch or not if you ask me? I don't know. I see figures is no problem, but sometimes we will also ask macam something wrong. Why suddenly so good one. Maybe from the transition of old business to new business people still don't understand it yet. Based on what the news flow, I understand they have been in the IT business of ERP and IoT for like a year already? So for me seems like you kind of see one year of performance already. This unknown variable is that decision you think and make for yourself.
My opinion is the name of this Company is ugly. It is called Aturmaju Resources Berhad. Maybe need to change to something like Ironman, Elon Musk, or something related to it la. Name is also important one ok. You need to represent it to something that reflect ERP and IoT. On the other hand, most people are still at the pre-Covid thinking so it's not easy to digest this since it is a big change. Thus I do see a very good long term prospect for this Company. You can ask any FA gurus if ARBB is good, and all of them will tell you it is, including me.
I'm not sure why ARBB stock comments there the people like to argue between each other for no reason =.="". Another thing is I find it funny is they like to curse the substantial shareholder which is Datuk Seri Liew Kok Leong (""Fatty Liew""). I add below let you see.

Additional note to explain about dilution and its impact (Important point) - Scenario to explain
In my humble opinion high PE also equivalent to dilution, if you see it as follows. I mean when I see this stock I see the ARBB-PA, I myself also straight bias and pointed dilution. However, since the P/E is still low. I think I illustrate and see if you all can understand. Can't blame you all also because I as an informed person will also think like that. I think it is merely a psychology barrier la, so we need to understand how we actually think.
PE = Share Price / Earnings per share (EPS)
So in case of dilution right, your EPS will become small, and as a result your P/E will become high.
So actually no difference if you refer it to a high PE company in this case. Any way their P/E currently is around 4-5 only. Normal tech Company if I'm not wrong is 25-30?
And sometimes don't think too pessimistic on a thing, sometimes things are not that bad as it seems, and sometimes when we're too optimistic, we also need to be careful. This is the best I could explain to you, as simple as possible.

Business Model
ARB implements a unique business model whereby it seeks to form a JV company with its target partner, where ARB will have the major controlling interest. Under the JV arrangement, the partner will provide the business know-how, while ARB will implement and periodically update its ERP solutions. The differentiating factor that makes this business model unique lies with the part where ARB will fully bear the cost of setting up the ERP solutions. Traditionally, SMEs are reluctant (or unable) to provide an upfront hefty investment on the implementation of ERP. Thus,this arrangement will entice prospective SMEs to form a JV agreement with the company. Under the JV agreement, both ARB and its JV partner are entitled to a share of profit from the JV. However, we are made to understand that in the initial years of the venture, the profits earned will be plough back for reinvestment purposes. This arrangement creates a ‘win-win situation’ whereby both parties will be able to focus on their respective field of expertise. (this part is their collaboration with their suppliers)"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=324","Sep 2, 2020 5:02 PM","tankoksiong","For customers, they will resell the customised ERP software system and information technology outsourcing (""ITO"") services.
If you are from the older generation and don't know what is ERP system and IoT I suggest you have a talk with some of your family members who are working in multinational companies to understand it further. Only by learning it, you will understand better what this company does. Usually for big companies they will use are Oracle, SAP and Microsoft.
The environment now embraces digitalisation and technology even faster, that's why you can see their business is doing well.
Since you have a bit of understanding now, I will tell you what you should be expecting this Company do. As you know collaboration with their suppliers require investments.
Below is their financial statement in balance sheet. We start with the assets parts. The main area I want to talk about is the property, plant and equipment, other investment, intangible assets, and trade receivables and cash and bank balances."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=324","Sep 2, 2020 5:02 PM","tankoksiong","(1) Property, plant and equipment - Please note that every quarter now and then, you should expect to see this increase over time? Why? Because you're doing IT, so sometimes you need to buy some equipment for you to test on your software, etc. To keep it short.
(2) Other investment - This is a new item, not specified for the time being, you can take it as investment with its JV partner. I mentioned above that they provide the investments and their JV partner witll impart their knowledge.
For (1) and (2) if you see under cash flow statements for every quarter please expect things like this (it is not something new) because you need to develop your ERP system for different segments and please bear in mind this Company is growing rapidly so you need to use money for development). Cash flow from investing activities as the name say you need to purchase certain things as invesment so your company can grow. This is different compare to cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operations means in normal operation of my business how much it is making."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=324","Sep 2, 2020 5:02 PM","tankoksiong","(3) Intangible assets - This is software and might have some licensed rights into it. It's common in IT based company.
(4) Trade receivables - This is the risk area, which I will explain in detail later.
(5) Cash and bank balances - RM38mil (cash and bank balance plus fixed deposit). This cash pile keep increasing due to the cash flow from operations and the conversion of ARBB-PA. The conversion of ARBB-PA is actually good for the Company because it gives the Company cash without some incurring interest costs. In other words actually ARBB is a form of free financing. If you see above, the cash flow from investing activity is on the negative right? My friends you need to take cash out to develop your product or not? Or course you need if you're growing rapidly. So if ""Fatty Liew"" keep convert his ARBB-PA you need to thank him not curse him, because it's free financing from him to undertake some development and reinvesting in the Company.
Positive cash flow from operations - No issues positive RM15mil"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=324","Sep 2, 2020 5:02 PM","tankoksiong","Having said that, in the event in the future if the Company have some borrowings, it's not a bad thing if you ask me. It's for growth. As you can see this quarter they already have net outflow of RM19mil due to this purpose.
Liabilities - No big deal. Only for the trade payables, they need to manage their supplier well to defer it as long as possible. I will go into the trade receivables part and you will understand."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=324","Sep 2, 2020 5:02 PM","tankoksiong","Key risk area - Trade receivables
Credit terms - You need to be aware of this.
Q1 2019 Report - Credit term of 90 - 120 days
Q2 2019 Report - Credit term of 90 - 120 days, with extended grace period of 90 days. Lets just take 180 days to 210 days
Q3 2019 Report - Credit term of 90 - 120 days, with extended grace period of 90 days. Lets just take 180 days to 210 days

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=324","Sep 2, 2020 5:02 PM","tankoksiong","The financing for its customers is around 180 days till 210 days to pay, so the Company must have sufficient cash to sustain. Cash flow from operations in the future quarters might sometimes become negative, because they take in customer but customer not yet pay them due to credit terms have not reach. This is not a negative thing entirely because their main customers are SME and like I say they are growing. So in future quarters you need to take note on the operating cash flow. If you see announcement about conversion of ARBB-PA, you should not see as dilution but say thank you very much to those people because it's free financing and the Company need the cash. All of you curse the wrong person already.
So having said that, it is important to understand how the business operates and how certain things you can relate to it.
Understand business > See financial performance > Relate how the two works.
FA gurus won't be able to tell what I told you, because I have been in audit line for 6 years, real experience in auditing companies, so I can relate to how they do business. My clients really taught me a lot on this and of course with a little awareness and eagerness to learn I can achieve this thanks to them. FA guru how they do is read report but cannot link to how people do business. That's the difference.
I tell you aware meaning you need to take note, not to say this is very super dangerous, so RUNNNNNNNNNN. This share many people don't know, those that spread negativity due to you lacking information just make you losses. Have they tell you all the facts that all my 3 articles tell you?"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=324","Sep 2, 2020 5:03 PM","tankoksiong","Dividends
Please don't ask me why this stupid Company don't give dividends? Hello, if Company is expanding rapidly and experiencing growth they won't give you dividends one la. Why? Give you dividends already how to grow fast? Company that give you dividends in general they are quite stable and most of them are rarely expanding. Take BAT as an example, not only its not expanding its performance have been terrible. I take the most easy example so you can understand.
So everything seems good with a little risk? But why a lot of people say this is a con man counter? Oh because always goreng tak jadi? Volume a lot but cannot move one?
This you need to ask the existing holders. I will tell you in summary why this Company cannot move up."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=324","Sep 2, 2020 5:03 PM","tankoksiong","1. Complains about auditor not doing their job well. I myself had uncovered a fraud case when I'm an auditor and the director go to jail because of that. Then I ask you one thing. Why my name is not well know one ah? If your Company got fraud case, you want to publish in newspaper one ah my friend? Of course you low profile as possible, otherwise who dare do business with you? You always see in news those news that say auditor never do job well, but I tell you how many cases we caught do you even know? Audit fee for ARBB is around RM68k in total and RM36k for non audit services. Total is only around RM100k. For such a low audit fee, the partner signing the account want to risk his/her reputation? ARBB is audited by RSM which is a respectable mid tier firm. You go ask auditors if every year their work in the same Company they auditng increase or decrease please? And I tell you auditor have lots of compliance thing to comply to.
2. The quality of the investor and shareholders. An example, glove counter investors always concern about earnings first. Share price is never an issue. ARBB investors? Day in day out complain why share price don't increase although earnings is good. There is a difference in this, maybe if you look it's the same but its not. If you have a lot of investor the character is panic sell one, do you think your share can go up? A bit a bit of drop they go throw all of their shares. You tell me. And please don't underestimate idiots ok. They may be idiots, but you never know it can be that they are very rich. Maybe good in doing certain things but just when come to shares they suck. Don't underestimate this group. Idiots sometimes can be rich while you how intelligent you are might be a poor person. Sometimes no logic but my friend that's reality.
Mentality of the existing investors need to educate them and create awareness to them, accept it or not it is really up to them. I can't change them. What I can do is to write an article to create awareness. That's the only thing within my power. If you ask me how long I took to understand the whole Company, it's two days."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=324","Sep 2, 2020 5:03 PM","tankoksiong","What you can do if you're looking at this Company as a long term good share?
1. Educate people by sharing this article, so they will know this Company inside out. If you see people in KLSE screener, OMG I can tell you what they write is really funny. Absolutely zero knowledge about this Company.
2. Patient, patient and patient
I'm writting to give more informed facts to potential true investors, to look into the potential of this Company. By attracting good quality investor who are informed then I can expect the share price to go up in the future. If I try to keep telling people buy buy buy there is no use. The share price won't move due to the quality of investor/shareholders of inferior quality. Everyday also so negative, how it bring good to the share?
Another thing is the operator for this counter is brutal. To understand this you need to see when this new shareholder come in to the Company and from then you see the pattern of chart. If you see 2 May 2019 at the top, this operator know how to push one. The thing is they have frustate a lot of people by 2 quarter consecutively after it is out the share start dropping. It seems they are accumulating at a certain range and push a bit make people panic. You can open the chart and see for yourself if you have time. You can see a lot of angry people due to this. Because the people behave like this everytime panic sell the operator happily follow the same method. Until your mindset change, then maybe the operator will be confused a bit. Ikan bilis not always will lose to shit head operator like that, you need to change a bit of strategy.
3. Buy as low as you can to be safe. The upside is tremendous if you believe in ARBB."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=324","Sep 2, 2020 5:03 PM","tankoksiong","Conclusion:
In any investment decision made, confirm there is a risk present. You drive on the road also got risk, you take flight also got risk. Risk is always present. What is important is put all facts together and see from that angle. Make your own decision and I wish you all the best. Please bear in mind, think carefully and rationally, don't just accept what I write, you must always be sceptical. You guys are awesome, in your own way.
PS: My comments are removed on 14/8/2020 if you guys realised. Normal conversation being removed, meaning a few things:
1. The operator saw my article and comments and paid i3investor to remove those comments made.
2. Negative people complain for whatever reason making my comments and few others dissapear.
3. And FYI people who keep spreading negative things are the one who are not helping anything about the stock. Why would you sell when the fundamental are good? Even if you buy high, when you sell is confirmed is you're already make losses. Just see those who make comments asking ARBB to drop more.
4. Since my comments are removed, I will surely buy more since certain people do not like what I did. What I did is just write 3 articles of facts.
Re-read my 3 articles to make sure you have a strong convinction and confidence."

And of course - ARB BERHAD (7181)
ARB’s key strengths include its design and development capabilities that allow it to create ERP solutions from the ground up – allowing it to craft highly customized systems that can cater to the varied needs of different industries, from retail to agriculture. In this way, ARB is able to cater to the specific needs of its target customer, who typically have very unique requirements with respect to system dashboards, customer support and applications & modules."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=325","Sep 3, 2020 9:04 PM","tankoksiong","With the experience gained from its JVs, ARB has a better appreciation of the requirements that users (business manager etc.) deployed on the ground have. It has therefore been able to tailor its ERP portfolio to be highly aligned to the challenges that SMEs typically face which include:
• Improving management integration;
• Gaining oversight on the costs and benefits from various business activities;
• Engaging in data-driven strategic planning;
• Instituting strict financial control measures;
• ARB’s ERP solutions are also highly scalable according to the needs of its customers (particularly SMEs) especially in the following areas;
• Incorporating machine learning, AI and data analytics tools to automate operations, business intelligence and marketing purposes;
• Achieving integrated supply chain management with a focus on visibility over warehouses and inventory;
• Accommodating multi-level membership/referral programmes;
• Integrating e-wallet solutions in retail systems;
• Optimizing backend operations to improve operational efficiencies; and
• Possessing the versatility required to handle operations across a wide range of industries."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=325","Sep 3, 2020 9:05 PM","tankoksiong","So, can other companies adopt what ARBB is doing? The short answer is no. ARBB's unique business model disable most, if not all close competitors in the ERP sector.
Here's another excerpt from the Frost & Sullivan analysis.
ARB approaches target SMEs (typically with a long track record of growth over 10-15 years) in the distribution and service industries who are in the early stages of their digital transformation journey to form joint ventures (JVs). These SMEs typically do not possess the funds or risk appetite to implement costly ERP solutions and are also facing operational and management inefficiencies that place a ceiling on their growth."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=325","Sep 3, 2020 9:05 PM","tankoksiong","• The JV takes over the business operations of the SME – with the SME focusing on sales and inventory management and ARB (with the controlling interest) financing and operating a customized ERP solution and periodically providing the necessary updates and new modules, freeing up cash flow for the SME in a mutually beneficial relationship. Beyond SMEs, ARB also uses similar JV models in projects with government linked companies (GLCs).
• ARB creates value for its JV partner by providing a solution (based on its technical/business know-how) designed to generate an immediate impact on sales and profits. ARB also improves business outcomes for its network of JV partners by allowing its network of partners to cross-sell their products and/or upsell packages to end customers.
• This innovative business model addresses three major pain points for customers and vendors in the ERP market
• Customers, particularly SMEs, being unwilling to spend on costly ERP implementation (by essentially shifting from a cash/debt driven model of technology investment to an equity-based model of technology investment.)
• ERP systems becoming obsolete or unfit for customers’ changing business needs (by ensuring that the motives of the technology provider and the client are aligned via a profit-sharing model – incentivizing the technology vendor to develop a better understanding of customer requirements and provide periodic upgrades and adjustments)
• Failure of outcome-based models as vendors have very limited levers to influence performance (by giving the technology provider direct managerial oversight to ensure that its ERP solution is being implemented alongside optimal business and workflow processes)
This article's purpose is not to ask you to buy ARBB shares. What my ultimate purpose is to increase the knowledge of public investors in the ERP and IoT sector (Will be sharing IoT's analysis soon), so that you would discover the true value of ARBB"

Now let's get back to our main topic - IoT prospects for ARBB."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=326","Sep 3, 2020 9:06 PM","tankoksiong","Ability to integrate solutions from a variety of vendors:
• In the Smart Home space, ARB has the capability to develop centralized control and monitoring solutions that can integrate a wide range of smart home devices and allow users to access these solutions via smartphone or desktop applications.
• In contrast, many of their competitors have exclusive arrangements with specific smart home hardware brands limiting their flexibility to design solutions according to property developers’ needs and budgets."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=326","Sep 3, 2020 9:06 PM","tankoksiong","Capabilities in large scale engagements:
The scale of IoT deployments can be defined as follows:
• Small scale: Less than 500 connected devices
• Medium scale: 500 – 10,000 connected devices
• Large scale: More than 10,000 connected devices
• ARB has demonstrated its ability to implement large scale IoT deployments, differentiating itself from its competitors who primarily occupy the small and medium scale space, leading it to be perceived as a top-tier IoT system integrator. This allows ARB to compete more effectively against larger players in future large scale implementation projects and secure collaborations with industry-leading players.
• For example, it signed an MoA with Hangzhou Mayam IoT Tech Co Ltd to potentially deploy 300,000 smart water meters (Phase one of the rollout) in a project worth RM 200 million, with ARB handling the installation, commissioning and testing of the water meters.
• It also inked an MoA with Shuifa IoT Tech Co Ltd to supply 300,000 Malaysian households with smart water filtration systems in a project worth RM 600 million"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=326","Sep 3, 2020 9:06 PM","tankoksiong","Synergies between IoT and ERP portfolios:
• ARB’s expertise in the ERP space together with its firsthand understanding of the demands that business users place on ERP systems has granted it experience regarding the suitability of dashboards, data analytics tools and data management processes. ARB carries this experience regarding effective customization over into the IoT space ensuring that the functionalities of its IoT solutions (UI, data analytics tools etc.) are in line with the business requirements of its clients.
• This focus on enhancing business outcomes distinguishes ARB from more traditional system integrators. Even established ERP vendors are in the beginning stages of augmenting their ERP offerings with IoT capabilities in this region – indicating that ARB can exploit first mover advantage with a hybrid IoT-ERP positioning."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=326","Sep 3, 2020 9:06 PM","tankoksiong","Proven track record of expanding into adjacent verticals as in the case of Re-Energy:
• Along with its primary focus on areas like smart home and water supply management, ARB continues to expand the scope of its business via strategic partnerships and acquisitions.
• For example, it embarked on its foray into the renewable energy segment through its acquisition of C&M Renewable Energy Technology Sdn Bhd in Malaysia allowing it to leverage its capabilities in IoT related system integration and solution engineering in large-scale renewable projects in Malaysia. This acquisition not only supports ARB’s vision of supporting environmental sustainability-related activities, it also allows ARB to be in a strong position to compete in the rapidly growing green energy industry in Malaysia, which is seeking to increase the share of renewable energy sources in the country’s energy mix from 2% in 2018 to 20% in 2025.
• ARB has demonstrated the ability to expand into sectors adjacent to its current focus areas by harnessing its IoT capabilities and leveraging targeted partnerships and acquisitions – indicating the potential for future expansion and growth.
To be very honest, I cannot find another proxy in Malaysia market for ERP and IoT sector apart from ARBB. I'm not sure why the share price of ARBB is dropping despite good profit growth and ultra bright prospects! However, it is my chance to accumulate ARBB shares and I currently hold quite substantial amount of the company's shares.

-Incorporating machine learning, AI and data analytics tools to automate operations, business intelligence and marketing purposes;
-Achieving integrated supply chain management with a focus on visibility over warehouses and inventory;
-Accommodating multi-level membership/referral programmes;
-Integrating e-wallet solutions in retail systems;
-Optimizing backend operations to improve operational efficiencies; and
-Possessing the versatility required to handle operations across a wide range of industries."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=328","Sep 9, 2020 7:16 PM","tankoksiong","Here's another excerpt from the Frost & Sullivan analysis.
ARB approaches target SMEs (typically with a long track record of growth over 10-15 years) in the distribution and service industries who are in the early stages of their digital transformation journey to form joint ventures (JVs). These SMEs typically do not possess the funds or risk appetite to implement costly ERP solutions and are also facing operational and management inefficiencies that place a ceiling on their growth.
The JV takes over the business operations of the SME – with the SME focusing on sales and inventory management and ARB (with the controlling interest) financing and operating a customized ERP solution and periodically providing the necessary updates and new modules, freeing up cash flow for the SME in a mutually beneficial relationship. Beyond SMEs, ARB also uses similar JV models in projects with government linked companies (GLCs).
ARB creates value for its JV partner by providing a solution (based on its technical/business know-how) designed to generate an immediate impact on sales and profits. ARB also improves business outcomes for its network of JV partners by allowing its network of partners to cross-sell their products and/or upsell packages to end customers.
This innovative business model addresses three major pain points for customers and vendors in the ERP market
Customers, particularly SMEs, being unwilling to spend on costly ERP implementation (by essentially shifting from a cash/debt driven model of technology investment to an equity-based model of technology investment.)
ERP systems becoming obsolete or unfit for customers’ changing business needs (by ensuring that the motives of the technology provider and the client are aligned via a profit-sharing model – incentivizing the technology vendor to develop a better understanding of customer requirements and provide periodic upgrades and adjustments)
Failure of outcome-based models as vendors have very limited levers to influence performance (by giving the technology provider direct managerial oversight to ensure that its ERP solution is being implemented alongside optimal business and workflow processes)"

Now let's get back to our main topic - IoT prospects for ARBB."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=328","Sep 9, 2020 7:17 PM","tankoksiong","Ability to integrate solutions from a variety of vendors:
In the Smart Home space, ARB has the capability to develop centralized control and monitoring solutions that can integrate a wide range of smart home devices and allow users to access these solutions via smartphone or desktop applications.
In contrast, many of their competitors have exclusive arrangements with specific smart home hardware brands limiting their flexibility to design solutions according to property developers’ needs and budgets.
Capabilities in large scale engagements:
The scale of IoT deployments can be defined as follows:
Small scale: Less than 500 connected devices
Medium scale: 500 – 10,000 connected devices
Large scale: More than 10,000 connected devices
ARB has demonstrated its ability to implement large scale IoT deployments, differentiating itself from its competitors who primarily occupy the small and medium scale space, leading it to be perceived as a top-tier IoT system integrator. This allows ARB to compete more effectively against larger players in future large scale implementation projects and secure collaborations with industry-leading players.
For example, it signed an MoA with Hangzhou Mayam IoT Tech Co Ltd to potentially deploy 300,000 smart water meters (Phase one of the rollout) in a project worth RM 200 million, with ARB handling the installation, commissioning and testing of the water meters.
It also inked an MoA with Shuifa IoT Tech Co Ltd to supply 300,000 Malaysian households with smart water filtration systems in a project worth RM 600 million."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=328","Sep 9, 2020 7:17 PM","tankoksiong","Synergies between IoT and ERP portfolios:
ARB’s expertise in the ERP space together with its firsthand understanding of the demands that business users place on ERP systems has granted it experience regarding the suitability of dashboards, data analytics tools and data management processes. ARB carries this experience regarding effective customization over into the IoT space ensuring that the functionalities of its IoT solutions (UI, data analytics tools etc.) are in line with the business requirements of its clients.
This focus on enhancing business outcomes distinguishes ARB from more traditional system integrators. Even established ERP vendors are in the beginning stages of augmenting their ERP offerings with IoT capabilities in this region – indicating that ARB can exploit first mover advantage with a hybrid IoT-ERP positioning.
Proven track record of expanding into adjacent verticals as in the case of Re-Energy:"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=328","Sep 9, 2020 7:17 PM","tankoksiong","Along with its primary focus on areas like smart home and water supply management, ARB continues to expand the scope of its business via strategic partnerships and acquisitions."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=328","Sep 9, 2020 7:18 PM","tankoksiong","For example, it embarked on its foray into the renewable energy segment through its acquisition of C&M Renewable Energy Technology Sdn Bhd in Malaysia allowing it to leverage its capabilities in IoT related system integration and solution engineering in large-scale renewable projects in Malaysia. This acquisition not only supports ARB’s vision of supporting environmental sustainability-related activities, it also allows ARB to be in a strong position to compete in the rapidly growing green energy industry in Malaysia, which is seeking to increase the share of renewable energy sources in the country’s energy mix from 2% in 2018 to 20% in 2025.
ARB has demonstrated the ability to expand into sectors adjacent to its current focus areas by harnessing its IoT capabilities and leveraging targeted partnerships and acquisitions – indicating the potential for future expansion and growth.
To be very honest, I cannot find another proxy in Malaysia market for ERP and IoT sector apart from ARBB. I'm not sure why the share price of ARBB is dropping despite good profit growth and ultra bright prospects! However, it is my chance to accumulate ARBB shares and I currently hold quite substantial amount of the company's shares."

ARB的主要优势包括其设计和开发能力，使它能够从头开始创建ERP解决方案-使其能够设计高度定制的系统，以满足从零售到农业等不同行业的不同需求。通过这种方式，ARB能够满足其目标客户的特定需求，这些目标客户通常对系统仪表板，客户支持以及应用程序和模块有非常独特的要求。
凭借从其合资企业获得的经验，ARB对现场部署的用户（业务经理等）的要求有了更好的了解。因此，它能够调整其ERP产品组合，使其高度适应中小企业通常面临的挑战，其中包括：
改善管理整合；
监督各种业务活动的成本和收益；
从事以数据为依据的战略规划；
实行严格的财务控制措施；
ARB的ERP解决方案还可以根据其客户（尤其是中小型企业）的需求进行高度扩展，尤其是在以下领域：
整合机器学习，人工智能和数据分析工具以自动化操作，商业智能和营销目的；
实现集中于仓库和库存可见性的集成供应链管理；
容纳多层次的会员/推荐计划；
在零售系统中集成电子钱包解决方案；
优化后端操作以提高操作效率；和
具有处理广泛行业所需的多功能性。
那么，其他公司可以采用ARBB的做法吗？最简洁的答案是不。 ARBB独特的业务模型使ERP领域的大多数竞争者（即使不是全部）都瘫痪了。"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=330","Sep 17, 2020 6:25 PM","tankoksiong","这是Frost＆Sullivan文分析的另一个摘录。
ARB的方法针对分销和服务行业中的中小企业（通常在10-15年内具有长期增长记录），这些行业处于数字化转型初期以组建合资企业（JV）。这些中小型企业通常不具备实施昂贵的ERP解决方案的资金或风险偏好，而且还面临运营和管理效率低下的问题，从而限制了其增长。
合资企业接管中小型企业的业务运营-中小型企业专注于销售和库存管理以及ARB（具有控股权）融资，并运行定制的ERP解决方案，并定期提供必要的更新和新模块，从而释放现金流用于与中小企业建立互惠互利的关系。除中小企业之外，ARB在与政府联系公司（GLC）进行的项目中也使用了类似的合资模式。
ARB通过提供旨在对销售和利润产生直接影响的解决方案（基于其技术/业务知识）为其合资伙伴创造价值。 ARB还允许其合作伙伴网络向最终客户交叉销售其产品和/或追加销售包装，从而改善其合资伙伴网络的业务成果。
这种创新的业务模型解决了ERP市场中客户和供应商的三个主要痛点
客户，尤其是中小型企业，不愿意在成本高昂的ERP实施上花费（通过从现金/债务驱动的技术投资模式转变为基于权益的技术投资模式）。
ERP系统变得过时或不适应客户不断变化的业务需求（通过确保技术提供商和客户的动机通过利益共享模型保持一致）–激励技术供应商更好地了解客户需求并提供定期升级和调整）
基于结果的模型的失败，因为供应商对性能的影响非常有限（通过给予技术提供商直接的管理监督以确保其ERP解决方案与最佳业务和工作流程一起实施）
本文的目的不是要您购买ARBB股票。我的最终目的是要增加公共投资商在ERP和IoT领域的知识（将很快分享IoT的分析），以便您发现ARBB的真正价值。"

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=332","Sep 29, 2020 12:40 PM","tankoksiong","Dear Fellow Investors,
Once again, we will discuss on the topic on share price again. And of course, this time its one of my favourite company - ARB BERHAD (7181). So some investors actually contacted me amidst the panic of why the stock price is dropping from RM 0.300 ish to RM 0.260. So here's my answer:"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=332","Sep 29, 2020 12:40 PM","tankoksiong","Ever heard of the toilet roll investment theory?"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=332","Sep 29, 2020 12:40 PM","tankoksiong","Let's say if this toilet roll were to sell at RM 10 per roll, assuming if the price dropped to RM 5 without change in its quality, would you buy more to stock (especially during the COVID-19 pandemic? UK is stocking up toilet rolls again) or would you prefer to buy in RM 10? I believe at this kind of time, ""value investors"" like housewives knows the best.
So, in simpler terms - would you buy something of a certain value (say RM 10) for a cheaper price of RM 5, or at a premium of RM 15? I believe the answer is obvious..
But when it comes to share investments, why are people buy shares when they are expensive, sell when its cheap? What is this madness behind the thought of doing so?? Well, I'm sure that's not the right way of investment. Buying when a share is cheap and selling it when its priced at premium is the simplest and easiest way to profit. For example, I bought AEONCR when its around RM 9 or so, so whats the price now? You know it..
The key value I would like to share here is, buy low and sell high essential means buy ""lower"" than its value, and sell ""higher"" than its value. As for ARBB, I've shared numurous times that the company is at least worth RM 0.500 or above.. So are you buying toilet roll at discount, or you want to chase it at premium? Its completely up to you! :)
Cheers and I wish your investment journey bodes well for you."

I've noticed the recent EMS sector and Semiconductor rally had left this company a laggard, a hidden gem behind the spike in the technology sector.
So when we talk about technology, in Malaysia generally we are focused on the ""hardware"" perspective, which our capabilities are mainly based on the manufacturing scale, as well as providing precision material to over sea clients or those who stationed in Penang. That being said, there are a few companies that excels in their own territory, MI (5286) is an excellent example of their technology on WLCSP.
So, which company we are going to discuss?
That company would be - ARB Berhad (7181) !"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=335","Oct 23, 2020 7:21 PM","tankoksiong","Now, you might hear some rumours on this company, saying that it is a con-man company, a scam company or whatsoever. But what you do not know is, the company profitability is growing despite all these haters. But let's look at the facts, or, the numbers."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=335","Oct 23, 2020 7:21 PM","tankoksiong","In FY 2018 Q1, I believe there were some impairment activities as they shut down the timber business, or the old timber business is down due to season, however it is, not important.
As you can see, the company had completely changed and spiked in terms of revenue and profitability since FY 2018 Q2, of course as all business was affected by COVID-19 and MCO, the company in FY 2020 Q2 had a minor setback in terms of YoY growth on the bottom line.
You might think that the company that is growing in QoQ and YoY might be valued at 20, 30 times P/E ratio?
No, ARBB was valued at 3.23 P/E. WHATTTTTTT?"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=335","Oct 23, 2020 7:23 PM","tankoksiong","That is because the general investor or ""ordinary investors"" do not appreciate this company. And why is that so? Remember I mentioned in Malaysia most if not all technology companies focus on the hardware part? THIS company focuses on the software aspect of the technology sector!
ARBB's unique business model compromise of 2 business engine, namely the first - Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) and Internet of Things (IoT), both are having a super rosy outlook, just check it out online.
Needless to say, ERP has become more and more important in the manufacturing world now with more resources are required to be allocated effectively. I foresee - this company could hit 8 figures in their net profit on the next quarter!
So, if you are looking at an undervalued technology company with PER of 2 to 3 times, would you choose it over a hardware company that face fierce competition but is trading at PER of 20 - 30 times? The choice is yours."

The bottom line, however, did not grow as quick as the revenue, but still gives very promising earnings, in which they grew from RM 8.2 Million to RM 8.4 Million.
The top and bottom line increase was mainly supported by the growth in ERP & IoT sector.
Also, the 9 months ended cash flow statement of the company shows that ARB Berhad had delivered positive operating cash flow in this quarter, as compared to a major deficit in cash flow of RM 15.7 Million in FY 2020 Q3."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=351","Nov 25, 2020 11:11 PM","Cedric Chan CA","ARB implements a unique business model whereby it seeks to form a JV company with its target partner, where ARB will have the major controlling interest. Under the JV arrangement, the partner will provide the business know-how, while ARB will implement and periodically update its ERP solutions. The differentiating factor that makes this business model unique lies with the part where ARB will fully bear the cost of setting up the ERP solutions. Traditionally, SMEs are reluctant (or unable) to provide an upfront hefty investment on the implementation of ERP. Thus,this arrangement will entice prospective SMEs to form a JV agreement with the company. Under the JV agreement, both ARB and its JV partner are entitled to a share of profit from the JV. However, we are made to understand that in the initial years of the venture, the profits earned will be plough back for reinvestment purposes. This arrangement creates a ‘win-win situation’ whereby both parties will be able to focus on their respective field of expertise. (this part is their collaboration with their suppliers)
For customers, they will resell the customised ERP software system and information technology outsourcing (""ITO"") services.
If you are from the older generation and don't know what is ERP system and IoT I suggest you have a talk with some of your family members who are working in multinational companies to understand it further. Only by learning it, you will understand better what this company does. Usually for big companies they will use are Oracle, SAP and Microsoft."

In particular arbb if you don't understand what's happening stay clear until you know what's happening. Not wrong staying sideline and learn. Decades back I learnt a very hard lesson listening to some shit ppl like newbie. Telling you the whole world crushing. Give you example on top glove. When the market goes against a certain counter this shit ppl will tell you shit stuff not knowing they are parotting the market. You need to be in front of the market. I can draft for you also what comment will be on top glove, just so you know what shit this ppl has been and will be talking. Tax high, elecitry bill high, wage high, ringgit appreciation, competition high red sea. Name it la just copy all these statements it will soon be discussed in I3. They don't like to buy rm5 topglove in 2015 but they like to chase topglove in 2020 when it was sold at rm30. You don't make money this way, only for newbie who at most transact few thousand will do this shit. If you are working on funds that worth few k transaction fees alone. Carry on gambling on theme play. If you bought topglove in 2015 and sell at 2020 it's a whopping 600% in 5 years. Ask the day traders if they can average 100% a year on average. Transaction fees alone will eat up most of their profit if they are in profit to start with. Worst when someone tell you they day trade on equity in Malaysia. Day trade on commodity yes, day trade on index yes, day trade on equity. Hahaha that's like telling ppl I got no leg but I kick ball."

The Trade Receivables increase to 60 M in Q2 then increase further to 85 M in Q3. The TR Turnover days base on Q3 TR was 159 days. Why customers took more than 5 months to pay ? No aging is provided. Why auditor didn't ask for aging? The other receivables also increased over the Qtrs. Another numbers : Company invested 23 million this year but can't find anything in Q3 report. May be this was stated in previous quarters. That means money from conversion to capital gone into investment. Not saying there are anything wrong but good and interesting to know the reasons.

由于许多读者抱怨理财嘛嘛档一直只介绍那种沉闷昂贵的公司，所以小篇决定推出富贵险中求这一个系列。
富贵险中求分别代表丰厚的获利与极大的风险，所以投资者还必须小心谨慎。如果喜欢这一个系列的话就记得按赞，分享让小篇有持续分享的动力吧！毕竟这里没有什么授课，tips，收钱报告，只有单纯的免费业余分享，唯一的动力就只是你的赞与分享了。
今天这一个系列的首炮就是争议性相当高的ARB集团。不认识ARB的朋友应该比较熟悉较热门的AGESON BERHAD也就是之前获得庞大沙石出口合约的公司。这两间公司的主要领导人物都是Dato' Liew Kok Leong, 并且都进行了ICPS筹资活动。由于不可赎回可转换优先股不断稀释公司的EPS，而疲弱的现金流也让公司争议不断。市场上也冒出了许多“老千股”，“盈利不可持续”，“顶着科技帽子的骗子”的声音。正所谓富贵险中求，有争议性的公司才具备这一个条件。想更加了解ARB集团的投资者建议去阅读Frost & Sullivan刊登的IoT和ERP马来西亚市场分析报告，没有的话可以PM小篇免费领取。祝大家投资愉快。

But i think like this counter share price (undervalue) many of us still did not understand the value and potential of ERP.

About the ICPS if i am not wrong if all the ICPS are convert it will add 376Million new shares.
Current EPS =1.90 with share issue 457 Million.
Added all converted ICPS, EPS will be around 1.0
Compare with other technology peers
Elsoft EPS = 0.4 share price 0.9
Krono EPS = 0.95 share price 0.7
Jcy EPS = 0.6 share price 0.5
Opensys EPS 0.7 share price 0.5
Ygl EPS = -0.07 share price 0.15
(EPS of latest quarter)
Anyway the ICPS have been convert since 2019 but still the share price able to touch 0.5.
Further more ARB already expanding the business to other southeast asia country such as cambodia, which is showing good future prospect of their business.

If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of ARB Berhad (KLSE:ARBB) looks great, so lets see what the trend can tell us."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=356","Jan 18, 2021 7:56 PM","bosskufanboy","What is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?
If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on ARB Berhad is:
Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)
0.20 = RM35m ÷ (RM217m - RM43m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2020).
So, ARB Berhad has an ROCE of 20%. In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the IT industry average of 7.8%."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=356","Jan 18, 2021 7:56 PM","bosskufanboy","The Trend Of ROCE
The fact that ARB Berhad is now generating some pre-tax profits from its prior investments is very encouraging. About five years ago the company was generating losses but things have turned around because it's now earning 20% on its capital. Not only that, but the company is utilizing 358% more capital than before, but that's to be expected from a company trying to break into profitability. This can tell us that the company has plenty of reinvestment opportunities that are able to generate higher returns.
The Bottom Line On ARB Berhad's ROCE
To the delight of most shareholders, ARB Berhad has now broken into profitability. Although the company may be facing some issues elsewhere since the stock has plunged 71% in the last five years. Regardless, we think the underlying fundamentals warrant this stock for further investigation."

Next, all ERP software demands a P/E ratio of 20 and above, except for loss making ones. So what P/E should you bestow upon ARBB? Again, let’s discount another 30% from the 20 times P/E ratio, and you would get a market capitalization of RM 329.28 Million, and when comparing to the current market capitalization of RM 121 Million, that would be a steep discount of 63%!

The fundamental is good, do not know why like some one want to press this counter.
Today volume are low but the price fall quicker.
I dont think the directors.. cause there will be announcement if they sold their share.
Beside, It to risky for the directors to dispose their share as the over all share issue are small and the share price too can be assume cheap.
Good company (profit and net cash) like this will be vurnerable to any takeover if the director keep dispose their share. They might not know whether someone silently collecting mother share and ICPS.
It already 2 years this counter turn to be technology counter but still stockhunter list this counter as industrial products services.
Anyway i always discuss about fundamental, so it might take longer for the values too be appreciated.
Traders should look at TA."

Now, it is time for us the reclaim the pride as educated investors. As a blogger, it is my duty to share with you this undervalued company that has been undermined and hid it from investors for them to collect more shares at a lower price.
Given the meteoric movement of technology stock prices recently, this company should have been part of it too, and this next company that is going to be “mooning” would be ARB BERHAD (KLSE:ARBB).
*mooning is the slang for a share price of a stock to rocket.
ARBB transformed from a timber company to a highly sophisticated ERP & IoT player in Bursa Malaysia. Given it’s earnings for the past 3 quarters of which are RM 6.8 Million / RM 8.5 Million / RM 8.4 Million respectively, the company only earned a low-single digit PER of close to 3 times. How is this possible?
My theory is that the investment banks or fund houses are purposely parking their position in higher ASK prices, i.e., 2 or 3 ticks higher than the LDP and collect at 2 or 3 ticks lower than the LDP. Just have a look at the screenshot of Bid / Ask captured from a brokerage platform below.
If ARBB was a bad company, why are people collecting them up to 7.4 Million units of it? When demand exceeds supply (By comparison of Bid / Ask participants & volume), a functional market would push the share price higher but not stagnant, or without movement. Just take a look at the past 3 months performance of ARBB.
Comparatively, another fundamentally solid company JFTECH had increased their valuation by 83.59% in the same 3 months period. How is this fair to ARBB?
It would be just matter of time before ARBB could rise to 50.0 cents! If you don’t believe me, someone had just put in a huge sum of money to convert the preference shares into the mother shares recently. If ARBB have no value at all, why would they do that?"

还记得近些年谈到蓬勃发展的科技领域时, 话题总是离不开Industrial Revolution (IR) 4.0, 5G Technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Automation & Robotics, Cloud Computing & Storage, Internet of Things(IoT)等主题, 而近期科技板块的崛起, 让我再次把目光投向这些话题里唯一还没有爆发的主题 - Internet of Things(IoT)......
ARBB前身为Aturmaju Resources Berhad, 从事木材领域(Timber Industry)的生意, 近几年转型科技领域(IT Segment), 且完全脱售木材领域的生意. ARBB主要的生意可以分为两个Segment : 物联网Internet of Things (IoT) & 企业资源计划Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP).
我们来简单了解一些这两门生意 :
IoT - 将各种物理对象连接到互联网, 无需人工干预即可通过无线网络接收和传输数据的物理设备系统. 从冰箱和灯泡等普通家用物品, 到运输标签和医疗设备等商业资产, 再到前所未有的可穿戴设备, 智能设备, 甚至是仅仅因物联网而存在的智能城市(Smart City).
ERP - 从供应链范围去优化企业的资源分配, 基于网络经济时代的新一代信息系统, 主要用于改善企业业务流程以提高企业核心竞争力.它是建立在信息技术基础上, 以系统化的管理思想, 为企业决策层及员工提供决策运行手段的管理平台.

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=360","Feb 8, 2021 12:38 PM","tankoksiong","On last Friday, dated 5th February 2021, numerous investors had shift their focus on YBS International Berhad (KLSE:YBS), which was previously known as LNG Resources Berhad, and the stock had rallied by over 30 percent in a single day. We believe this was due to the raging demand of investor to seek for undervalued technology counter to invest their capital into it, and YBS, just happened to be one of the “gem”.
But based on the technical chart, it seems like YBS is poised to retrace and profit taking activity is inevitable. The next question should ask is where would the money flow into after YBS?
The plain and simple answer would be – another technology company.
Based on our analysis, there are currently a sum of 90 technology companies listed in Main & Ace Market. However, more than half of these self-proclaimed technology companies are loss making companies, which made up to 46 of them having a negative PER to-date.
We did another study on the remaining 44 technology companies which are profitable and portray a positive PER. The average PER for these company is 66.74 times, seems high and crazy, right?
No. if you would compare the statistic with any financially matured stock market, this is quite the standard, or undervalued valuation for technology companies!
The obvious next step that we need to do is to identify out of the 44 technology companies, which has the deepest value in it, a.k.a. lowest valuation? We must be careful and apply quality and quantitative value investing in this approach as not sustainable profitability or companies that show a one-off profit that inflates their EPS should not be regarded as a candidate for our stock pick. Fortunately, I’m able to pinpoint this ultra-undervalued gem – ARB Berhad (KLSE:ARBB).
Based on our study, the price movement of ARBB shows a divergence between the company and Malaysia technology index as a whole. Over the past 3 months, Bursa Technology Index had delivered a 37.49% ROI while ARBB only delivered 7.84% in return. If we are being realistic here, there is a bare minimum of 20% upside for ARBB!
Bear in mind, we are not talking about 50%, 100% ROI within a short period of time. In my humble opinion, a 20% return before the Chinese New Year break from trading is easily achievable. Just look at the divergence! And now, to enhance your confidence level on the company, we will dive deep into value.
As I mentioned previously, our studies showed that on average any profitable technology companies arehaving a 66.74 times PER. While ARBB is trading at a mere 3.51 times PER! There must be a huge misjudgement in terms of profitability of this company that investor missed out. Also, the lack of coverage of this company from “gurus” had left it a untouched gem, waiting for investor to harvest it. Let’s just say ARBB could achieve 10 times PER by end of 2021, what is the return of this company for you
We also mentioned above qualitative and quantitative studies must apply to technology companies. For the past 8 financial quarters, ARBB had delivered an average profit of MYR 8 – 9 Million. There were no one-off profit in these quarters, and the profit had remain consistent throughout the financial year. So, ARBB is another solid technology company that remains uncovered.
Take our advise and ARBB should be your “Ang Pao” from us before Chinese New Year. Of course it’s up to you to trust us, or leave out the opportunity. However based on our studies, a 20% rally is approximately 5.5 cents away, how hard would it be?"

• From timber processing previously, ARBB has now ventured into the information technology (IT) business, focussing on Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Internet of Things (IoT) system solutions.
• The business transformation initiative has borne fruits after the Group registered net profit of RM32.8m in FY Dec 19, up from RM4.2m the year before. And the earnings momentum continued in FY20 with ARBB’s bottomline coming in at RM23.7m (+8% YoY) for the nine-month period ended September 2020.
• In addition, its debt-free balance sheet is backed by cash holdings of RM26.9m (or 5.8 sen per share) as of end-September last year.
• On the chart, ARBB shares are currently hovering near a support line that stretches back to September last year. The stock is also eager to breach a descending trendline at this juncture.
• With the stochastic indicator showing the %K line just crossed above the %D line when both values were below the oversold level recently, there is a fair chance that the share price would stage a technical breakout ahead.
• That being the case, the stock could be on its way to test our resistance thresholds of RM0.32 (R1; 14% upside potential) and RM0.37 (R2; 32% upside potential).
• We have placed our stop loss price at RM0.24 (or 14% downside risk from yesterday’s close of RM0.28).

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=361","Feb 10, 2021 4:18 PM","tankoksiong","在上个星期五，也就是 2021 年 2 月 5 日内；众多投资者把他们的投资目标锁定在 YBS International Berhad（KLSE：YBS）上。这家公司在转名前其公司名字为 LNG Resources Berhad，这家公司也在当天暴涨了 30% 之多。我们的分析团队相信这是本地投资者在寻求被低估的科技公司所增加的需求量所导致的。而 YBS，恰好就是这颗 ”宝石“。
不过，从技术分析上看来 YBS 在明天非常有可能面临回调以及套利活动。我们的下一个问题是，这些从 YBS 中套利的资金接下来会流到哪里去呢？
然而，最简单，最直接答案将会投资是另一家科技公司。
根据我们团度所进行的分析，本地约有 90 家科技公司在主板以及 ACE 市场上市。但是这些所谓的 ”科技公司“ 竟然超过一半是没有盈利的，也就是面临亏损的公司。这也造就了在 90 家公司内，有 46 家公司是拥有负 PER 估值的。
我们的团队也进行了另一项研究；在这剩余的 44 家科技公司内，他们的盈利当通过 PER 计算时竟然拥有 66.74 倍的估值，是不是看起来非常疯狂，恐怖呢？
但实际上，在成熟的金融市场里面这样的科技股估值只能算是正常而已，甚至，在部分的市场这样的估值还能算是 ”低估“ 呢！
投资者最为明显的下一步棋就应该从这 44 家具有盈利的科技公司内选取拥有最深的价值的公司，或最低估值的科技公司。但在分析时投资者必须要步步为营，通过深入的价值分析了解公司所赚取的盈利是否是短暂的，或包含了一次性的盈利，尤其是一些滥竽充数通过特别手段提高 EPS 的公司，都应该从我们的选股从被剔除。所幸的是，在芸芸众股内，我们团队成功的找到了这家超级被低估的科技公司 - ARB Berhad（KLSE: ARBB）。
我们的团队通过分析 ARBB 以及马来西亚科技公司在三个月内的股价走势发现了分歧。在过去三个月中，马来西亚科技公司平均呈现了 37.49% 的涨幅，而同期对比的 ARBB 却只是上涨了 7.84% 而已。通过这样简单的分析，ARBB 至今最少有 20% 的涨幅还未被实现！
请你留意，我们这里所提到的并不是 50%，或 100% 的回酬率，而是可实现的 20%，在新年前的收益，是非常可达的一个目标，你只要看看其中的分歧就好了。不过，为了进一步的提高读者们对于 ARBB 的信心，我们团队会更进一步的分析 ARBB 的价值所在。
如同我先前提到的，我们团队的分析发现可获利的马来西亚科技公司平均 PER 估值为 66.74 倍，而 ARBB 目前的 PER 估值才是微小的 3.51 倍！这其中必然有许多投资者错误的判断了公司的价值。另外在媒体上因为缺少对 ARBB 的关注，这才导致公司被严重低估！那么，假设你在目前投资了 ARBB 的话，未来 ARBB 回到稍微正常的 10 倍 PER，你的回酬率有多高呢？
刚才我们也提到了分析公司不能以片面来观看其盈利能力。我们团队分析了公司过去八个季度的业绩，发现 ARBB 平均每个季度将会为投资者带来约八百万至九百万令吉的盈利，并且这八个季度内都并无包含任何一次性的盈利，且波动性也不大。因此，可以判断出 ARBB 是一家非常稳定且未被发现的潜力科技公司。
只要你愿意相信的话，ARBB 很可能会成为读者们新年的 ”红包“。当然若是你不信我们团队也无法强迫你。但是通过我们深入的分析，从 ARBB 中赚取最少 20% 盈利是非常简单且易达到的。公司以目前股价只需要再上涨大约 5.5 仙，以 ARBB 目前被低估的程度，很难吗？"

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=365","Feb 16, 2021 12:14 AM","bosskufanboy","Trade receivables simply means someone who purchased your goods or services but have not pay you yet. Normally, businesses in Malaysia generally have a “business-period” of 90 – 120 days, and hence would be placed under Current Assets. Any date lesser than 365 does or collectable within a year would be categorize under Current Assets.
So why ARBB’s trade receivables would beplaced under Non-Current Assets? This is because the unique business model of ARBB in the ERP sector. ARBB is completely different and unique amongst Malaysian ERP providers. They do not provide one-off software sales or do it on a lease basis. But ARBB would provide professional business advisory and custom build ERP software for businesses to enhance their business model and sales efficiency."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=365","Feb 16, 2021 12:14 AM","bosskufanboy","So, let’s say if ARBB do partner with a property developer. We all know that property developer does not collect all cash right at the moment of selling properties. But only by a progressive basis. Just take a look at ECO WORLD DEVELOPMENT GROUP BERHAD (KLSE:ECOWLD)’s balance sheet.
It would not be out of the world to guess that ARBB had currently joint-ventured with any big-name property developers. (Hint-hint, it should not be ECOWLD) Some might argue that the cash flow was weak, but I think investor’s reaction after the result announcement tells it all. This company is super solid in fundamental terms.

段爱国表示，华为将通过ICT技术帮助猪场智能化，为猪场提供传感器、物联网技术及平台，其5G智能猪场ICT基础设施解决方案总体架构将构建智能猪场现代化生产体系，使科学防疫可更智能及高效、提高无人生产效率、AI繁育助力PSY提升（AI育肥＋AI猪肉品质提升），综合提升养猪效益。
华为拓展智能养猪方案有迹可寻。该公司2020年发表“5G引领现代猪场AI使能智能养猪”的报告，认为数据是现代养猪的核心要素，更是养猪智能升级的核心驱动力。从以往以“人管”为主到未来以“数据管”猪场为主，再运用AI技术做更多的科学决策，以达致养猪的标准化和程序化。
任正非早前受访时亦曾提及养猪，他说，如果本身考不上大学，养猪可能也是养猪状元。"

在这么多的科技股里面，可以说最 “离奇” 的应该就是 ARBB 这家公司了 在各大科技股都涨个不停的同时，这家公司的 PE 估值竟然才 3 – 4 倍而已？大家也先别急，先看完这个季报再深入了解了才做买卖决定吧！
ARBB 本身呢，原本是从木材领域 出身的。但在新的管理层加入过后，ARBB 就在去年正式加入了本地交易所的科技板块内，并且在转型后交出的业绩也是相当不错的。不过如果你仔细看的话，虽然盈利是在上涨中，但是在 FY 2020 Q1 – Q3 的每股收益 EPS 却是在下滑中，到底是怎么回事呢？
这就要提起 ARBB 本身在过去发行高达 1,008,150,000 股 ICPS 说起了.. 在 2018 年的时候，ARBB 在开始转型时曾经通过发行 15:1 股的 PA 附加股，那么简单来说就是通过发行附加股来 “卖” 优先股，但是这个优先股因为不是直接对于股权稀释（因为优先股并不是实质股权，需要转换成母股才能享有母股的股东权益），因此一些高手早就进行价差交易，从中赚了不少钱了..
不过，这也已经过去了，现在的话有兴趣了解可以去参考一下 NIHSIN 的优先股 那么当时后的 ARBB 呢，总股数也不过是 67,210,000 左右而已。那么现在的 ARBB 总股数已经是 465,000,000 左右了，这笔帐到底是怎么算的呢？
先前认购 ARBB-PA 的投资者呢，因为发现了价差的机会，因此许多人就把 PA 换成母股在市场上出售，一方面 ARBB 公司本身可以获得融资（转换成母股需要支付一笔钱），另一方面也增加了 ARBB 的总股数，我们可以理解为至今的投资者已经转换了额外 397,790,000 左右股 PA 了
如果理解了这部分的话，相信对于公司为什么盈利数字不断提高，但是 EPS 反而下跌会有一个很容易理解的概念了 – 因为 EPS 是以盈利除与总股数，若是盈利成长比不上股数增加的速度的话，就会出现 EPS 下跌的情况了！
那该回到 ARBB 这个季度的业绩上了。ARBB 在这个季度的营业额为 RM 72.5 Million，对比去年同个季度增加了61.0%，而净利也达到了 RM 19.31 Million，对比去年同个季度增加了 54.2% 左右，而管理层提到说这主要是来自于公司的 ERP 以及 IoT 业务方面的增长的
而在这个季度内呢，可以看到 ARBB 确实有正经营现金流的迹象，但是对比上个季度大约增加了 RM 0.9 Million 而已，对比盈利而言依然是有一段差距.. 而另外一个值得留意的事项就是公司的资产负债表上增加了一个 Non-Current Trade Receivables，简单来说就是这个在业务上的欠债人需要在 12 个月后才能付款给公司，金额高达 RM 64.1 Million.. 那么问题来了 Trade Receivables 也是可以 Non-Current 的吗？
答案是可以的，不过没有那么普遍而已..
总之，这个季度的业绩改善是蛮大的，而 EPS 也从 FY 2020 Q1、Q2、Q3 的 2.33、2.30、1.90 改善到 4.34 之高，投资者看起来也对于这次的业绩挺满意的..
不知道大家怎么看接下来 ARBB 股权稀释以及业绩方面的有趣故事呢？

Based on current price 0.385 ( mothershare ) & 0.13 ( PA ) , which means after the conversion you still have around 0.055 cents profit as a buffer."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=370","Feb 18, 2021 7:25 AM","influenza19","When mother share moving up, there is lot of people talking about ARBB-PA, expecting it will bring higher and faster profit by converting to mother share.
In reality this set of retailers are the one that create selling pressure while the mother share trying to climb up.
If you want to convert from PA to mother, it takes time (1-2 weeks). As share has up and down, might be during you convert to mother share it is already falling down. If you play with mother u can sell when it breach the support level, but while converting u can do nothing.
Then your cost of buying already higher than current mother share. From trying to make quick profit, you have become long holder.
This type of retailers that always bad mouth this counter. Feeling stress cause they actually do not have holding power. When the mother share up a little bit, they will try to escape.
The owner even if they convert their PA (i believe they are holding most of it), they will not sell their share cause it will effect the portion of their holding. Converted mother will not effect the mother share price as long it not being sold at lower price. Plus if any of main shareholders sold their share, there will be an announcement at bursa.
There is a reason why the PA price did not moving up as much.
Play with mother share, u can choose when to cut lost or take profit.
Dont try to buy PA and wish to convert it to gain quick profit. This type of traditional play only can be play if the mother share is not volatile (steady moving up) or you have holding power.
New era of stock is trading with fluidity.
FA for long term, TA for short term.
From my point of view, if mother share can break and hold above 0.42 this week, this share can fly.
If not it will trade sideway until next QR, even worst it will fall below current PA converter price to punish the PA converter.
Peace .. this is just my opinion."

Son PA is low cost and money is not free (you have to pay interest to borrow money) so In an efficient logical market PA+19sen should be higher than mother ARBB.
Also have to consider how much time to expiry.
Time is also not free. So, have to add the cost of time into the equation."

5G is a fifth generation mobile network that provides super fast connectivity needed to enable technologies like artificial intelligence and the internet of things (IoT), by allowing connection with machines or devices.
ARBB is well positioned to reap the benefits of 5G. Many IoT ideas that are impossible to implement at the moment will be doable with 5G.

KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 23, 2021 - (Media OutReach) - In the past three financial years, ARB Berhad (""ARB"" or ""Group"") has not only staged a very successful turnaround but has also consistently registered substantial net profit growth. As recent as the fourth quarter of the financial year 2020, the Group achieved a massive leap of 55% in the bottom line.
The Group's success in breaking away from its decade-long losses lies in its strategic diversification into the field of enterprise resource planning (ERP) and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions.
To date, ARB is amongst the lowest in terms of valuations when compared to its peers in the technology sector. The Group had also managed to deliver meaningful growth to its shareholders despite facing the negative influence of the pandemic.
ARB is in a net cash position, with cash and cash equivalents worth RM24.5 million against zero borrowings as of 31 December 2020.
Looking ahead into 2021 and beyond, ARB's upward growth momentum is poised to continue, underpinned by the immense potential in digitalisation among businesses and the Industry 4.0 agenda.
After posting its record-high net profit in the financial year of 2020 (FY20), the Group is confident of achieving a more robust performance in the current FY21.
ARB's Executive Director Dato' Sri Larry Liew Kok Leong said that the Group aims to expand its geographical presence and access various new industry sectors by taking advantage of cross-border business opportunities in 2021.
""In line with our regional expansion plan, we intend to collaborate with local partners to extend our footprint in our information technology (IT) Segment in other countries through the acquisition of business and technologies,"" he said.
A key growth strategy for 2021 would be ARB's move in providing more cloud-based product offerings, which would be achieved through the execution of partner-ecosystem in growing industries.
At the domestic front, Dato' Sri Liew said ARB plans to work closely with government-linked companies, multinational corporations and public listed companies as envisaged under its 2021 business plan.
""Our cloud solutions have proved to improve management efficiency and accelerate a business' digitalisation initiatives. At the same time, the solutions would also help to achieve cost-effectiveness,"" according to Dato' Sri Liew.
Moving forward, the Group also intends to expand into new horizontal markets such as providing cloud-based solutions to facilitate the new norm of business needs.
""As part of the growth strategy driven both organically and through strategic acquisitions, we are delivering innovative solutions in new categories, including Big Data analysis, e-commerce solutions, IoT platform for 5G and data cybersecurity, and expect to continue grow these businesses in the future,"" said Dato' Sri Liew.
He added further that the Group will accelerate rolling out IoT platform-based smart home solutions that have been gaining traction, especially among households in the urban area.
ARB's IoT platform would be able to integrate a wide range of electrical appliances, allowing multi-connection and readiness of artificial intelligence learning features for the ease of use of home occupants.
According to Dato' Sri Liew, ARB's growth prospects are intact as it is well-positioned in two promising operating segments, namely, ERP and IoT. Our ERP and IoT segments will drive alignment, focus and growth while sharpening our partners' focus. In addition, we are excited to see our IoT solutions business return to growth by serving more enterprises, further building on our annualised recurring revenue.
Based on the statistics by Frost & Sullivan, the Malaysian IoT market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 24.7% from US$2.2 billion in 2019 to reach US$10.3 billion by 2026.
Meanwhile, the Malaysian ERP market is projected to grow from US$120 million to reach US$255 million in 2026, growing at a CAGR of 11.4% in the same period.
""ARB's unique cloud-based ERP business model reduces the Group's dependence on external technology vendors and allows it to capture a bigger share of the value pool generated from the collaborations.
Dato' Sri Liew expects the ERP segment to remain as the main revenue contributor for ARB in FY21, with continued recurring income potential.
The ERP segment is expected to deliver 65% of total turnover, while the remaining will be contributed by the IoT business. Both segments are expected to be in line with the global initiative in advancing into the new era of Industry 4.0."

""We create value by providing a tailor-made solution for our JV partners, designed to generate an immediate impact on sales and profits. At the same time, it also improves our business as we allow our JV partners to cross-sell their products and upsell packages to end customers, hence creating a synergistic relationship,"" he added.
""The Group will continue to look for opportunities that might open up amidst the crisis, observe the market situation and adapt to what is needed in the current market to ensure the sustainable growth to the Group,"" Dato' Sri Liew said.
In FY20, the Group's net profit grew by nearly 25% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM43.46 million, on the back of a 114% surge in revenue to RM219.45 million. It staged a turnaround in FY18 with a net profit of 4.23 million and continued to grow its bottom line to RM32.8 million for FY19. The Group has continually achieved its steady three-year earnings growth in revenue and net profit since 2018.
With 2021 set to be a year of recovery, underpinned by an improvement in business sentiment, ARB's outlook appears to be positive.
ARB would be a key beneficiary of an increase in capital expenditure among businesses to digitalise their internal operations.
Currently, the Group has one of the lowest price-to-earnings ratios in the technology sector at just 4.6 times as of 22 February 2021 as compares with other technology industry players such as Mi Technovation Bhd (64.4 times), Inari Amerton Bhd (63.5 times) and ViTrox Corp Bhd (88.8 times).

The public cloud storage and computing system used to seem so far apart with us, but time has changed everything, cloud is getting more important and relevant to huge businesses! Even the darling ETF in town – ARK has predicted cloud performance and costs are improving as we progress.
However, what could this spell for Malaysian investors?
There is obviously growth to be found in cloud-related companies. But for us, Malaysian investors, it is extremely difficult, and we would face additional risks to invest in the oversea market even if its ETF, be it active or passive. So, what should we do?"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=375","Feb 24, 2021 2:47 PM","rapparesh","Fortunately, upon browsing through Bloomberg Terminal, I stumbled upon this company’s article. Which was titled “ARB Berhad upbeat about its cloud-based IT solutions”. Sounds familiar?
Link for the article: https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-02-23/arb-berhad-upbeat-...
In this article, Bloomberg mentioned that ARB Berhad (KLSE:ARBB) would offer more cloud-based products to enhance their services, which I believe the was in line with the management’s goal to add value to stakeholders as well as leveraging on their partner-ecosystem strategy."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=375","Feb 24, 2021 2:47 PM","rapparesh","It was also mentioned that the group’s product offerings expansion could be benefited from the new norm of business needs. We had seen big companies to allow their worker to choose their workplace in “hybrid mode”, which mean the employees could work from office, or home. Due to this new trend, the cloud services demand would be higher and higher.. ARK was right!
Let’s come back to what an investor can do to leverage the trend. There are only a few companies that are listed and involved in cloud services, and most of them are involved in cloud security. ARBB is the only pure play cloud management system provider who could grow alongside with their clients. To recap, ARBB is trading at a much, much lower valuation of single digit PER as compared to its peers! Our team had also worked out the calculation, and the final results show that ARBB was at least worth 80 cents and above.
Today ARBB had seen a deep discount of 7% - 9%.. Do not miss out on this opportunity!"

Is there anything to do with the conversion price of 20 sen to mother share too?
if PA reach 20 sen, does it mean i can convert without having to pay anything extra?"

Meaning that if you have bought the PA at current price 16.5 sen, you need to take 20sen out plus 16.5 sen => total cost will be 36.5 sen to convert to mother sen. By calculation on paper, you are actually earn 2.5 sen, but it will take some time about 2 weeks for the conversion to happen. So, there is a risk if the price of both mother and pa share drop during this conversion period. If you are prepared to hold for long terms, then it should be fine as The future prospect is good for this counter."

Backed by a record net profit of RM19.7 mil in its recently concluded FY2020, the group is also eyeing to capitalise on the surge in demand for cloud-based computing following the COVID-19 pandemic, according to executive director Datuk Seri Larry Liew Kok Leong.

Liew further noted that there is a rising demand from international clients as digitialisation efforts and cost-optimisation for the long-term is seen from the solutions offered.
In order to meet the growing demand, ARB intends to collaborate with its local partners and look into potential M&A to expand its geographical presence and access various new sectors by taking advantage of cross-border business opportunities in 2021."

Having undergone a massive transformation since 2018 from a timber business operator to an IT software and platform provider, ARB has seen a sharp turnaround over the last three financial years.
The group’s success in breaking away from its decade-long losses lies in its strategic diversification into the field of ERP and IoT solutions."

Apart from the “gentle push” of the pandemic for the world to adopt cloud computing quicker, it was also predicted that cloud system infrastructure services (IaaS) would grow by approximately 27 percent in 2021 as compared to 2020. Cloud computing has become more and more important and inevitable to become the new norm for businesses and average-joe user like you and me.
However, we should be focusing on investing in the company that are involved in cloud and is one that could generate the most return to us. Are there even any companies in Malaysia that are in the massive cloud business?"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=378","Mar 3, 2021 4:54 PM","tankoksiong","There is one major player in Malaysia. And fortunately for investors, this company is listed; and based on its ultra-low single digit PER, this company is still un-discovered by most investors!
And this one company would be ARB Berhad (ARBB). ARBB stands out as the enabler for Small & Medium Enterprises (SME) to get involved in the benefit of cloud services via their Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) sector. ARBB had taken the initiative to absorb the upfront investment of SMEs to use cloud IaaS, by doing so, ARBB would profit from the growth of the SME and rather than a one-off profit, ARBB could create a sustainable source of earnings growth."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=378","Mar 3, 2021 4:55 PM","tankoksiong","Let’s talk numbers.
ARBB had achieved a record profit since its successful turnaround from a timber company where it was backed by a bottom line of MYR 19.7 Million. Alongside with a strong net cash position of MYR 24.5 Million, the group was also seeking any potential M&As in the cloud segment.
For more information, click on this link to read more: https://focusmalaysia.my/featured/arb-sees-cloud-computing-as-its-magi...
The article was also showing some interesting statistics. For example, the group is currently having the lowest PER in Technology Board in Bursa Exchange. When we compare to MI, INARI, VITROX and so forth who has the PER of 65 times, 64 times and 89 times respectively, ARBB’s current PER of 4.3 times is ridiculously cheap!"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=378","Mar 3, 2021 4:55 PM","tankoksiong","So why is ARBB not being discovered by majority of the investor? I believe this was caused by the complexity of the company’s business. Only a very small portion of investors understand cloud computing and ERP. Hence, the opportunity shines upon us to invest in this deeply undervalued company!
Luckily for us, the company’s share price had retraced from recent high due to global flattened investment sentiment mainly disrupted by the spiking of US 10 Years Bond Yield. And I believe now is the best chance for us to invest in this company!"

Nasdaq 100 Index had retreated by 6.90% for the past month and as for our local technology benchmark index of FBM Technology Index, had shown a retracement up to 3.97%.
Investors now might have one question in mind – does this spells game over for technology stocks?
In the longer term, the retracement was healthy as majority of the technology stocks had enjoyed a over-premium pricing of 60-70 times of PER. Now it is the time for retracement.
However, one company had remained resilient despite some of the big names such as D&O (7204), MI (5286) and PENTA (7160) had dropped more than 20% from its peak. And this company would be ARB Berhad (“ARBB”).
Despite the fear in the market, ARBB did not drop despite the high volume today. This might be caused by its solid fundamental and low-compared to peer comparison. Most do not aware that ARBB is trading at single digit PER of 4.16 times!
As you can see, ARBB’s profit and revenue are growing steadily recently. Since their ultimatum transformation of timber company to a ERP & IoT play, the stock price had rallied; but not to its fair value yet! Not to mention the company had such good fundamentals to support its pricing, unlike some technology companies who are solely base on sentiment.
Long story short, this is a new chapter and / or beginning of a new engine to kickstart ARBB to RM 1.00 in the near future.
Stay strong, and follow through the growth of this company!"

Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy in which an investor divides up the total amount to be invested across periodic purchases of a target asset in an effort to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase. The purchases occur regardless of the asset's price and at regular intervals. In effect, this strategy removes much of the detailed work of attempting to time the market in order to make purchases of equities at the best prices. Dollar-cost averaging is also known as the constant dollar plan.

Wednesday, 10 Mar 2021
PETALING JAYA: The correction in the technology sector, as evident from the heavy sell-off among technology darlings in the United States and Malaysia, is likely to be short-term in nature.
Experts believe the long-term prospects of technology stocks remained intact, and hence, will not derail the sector’s massive rally that began a year ago."

the exercise ration is 20
to convert to 1 share ARBB, one either surrender 1 ARBB-PA and top up with 19 sen , or use 20 ARBB-PA to convert to 1 ARBB,
so the second scenario is definitely out of the question for the moment when 1 ARBB-PA market price is 0.17. No sane person will do that unless got too much wealth to burn.
The conversion of ARBB-PA to ARBB is definitely welcome by the company as it brings in 19 sen working capital for every 1 ARBB share issued, but for the shareholders, it has dilutive effect as the NTA of ARBB is 40 sens.
1 share of ARBB-PA is now 17 sen, top it up with 19 sen, you will get 36 sen, That is the main reason why the share price is stucked at current level when an active conversion is taking place."

To ensure that businesses and residents in TRX meet the daily sustainable targets, we employ Internet of Things (IoT) solutions to improve operational efficiency and reduce carbon footprint.
IoT technologies are used in the district to monitor and manage district operations such as streetlights, waste, and environmental conditions, instantly alerting any irregularities, such as faulty equipment or overflowing waste bins. All the IoT data will be integrated into a single platform which will be used for service optimization and continuous improvement initiatives for the district management; from strengthening HSE standards to elevating visitors' experience, right down to the placement of waste bins based on the analysis of pedestrian movement.
TRX's on-site wastewater treatment and recycled plant, designed to cut usage of potable water within the district by 50%, is part of its smart water management system. Smart water sensors are installed in the water networks to provide clear view of water flow, measuring water quality and potential contamination, detecting leaks and monitoring water pressure. These sensors provide early detection and diagnosis, which allow for quick corrective actions.
In conserving energy, smart meters will be installed in common areas to optimize usage. TRX will also generate renewable energy via solar panels, which will be placed on the roofs of covered pedestrian walkways.

As investors are aware, DBT is the acronym of Direct Business Transaction. It is a method of crossing shares without going through the open market, which very buy and sell transaction would affect the current stock price of the company.
Some smart investors also use DBT as an indicator to identify some potential investments under their sleeves. For example, the company we are going to discuss today did 13 million of DBT today!"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=382","Mar 15, 2021 3:41 PM","soonning65","Today, ARB Berhad (KLSE:ARBB) had a total of 13 million shares crossed off-market, and the average value per share was crossed at the price of 33.0 cents per share, which is at a discount of 12.0 percent based on today's LDP.
What does this mean to investors?
It means the company had crossed 13 million shares to someone. And based on the company’s latest copy of annual report, only Top 11 ranked and above had 13 million shares on hand, and the rest are mainly the “big shareholders” of the company! If they were to transact off market, based on their shareholding it would trigger an announcement to the public.
But it doesn’t."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=382","Mar 15, 2021 3:42 PM","soonning65","Which means, the company wanted to cross some shares to this “particular party” without getting noticed! Based on our team’s experience, this normally means that this new shareholder of the company had something to do with the company’s future development.
Upon cross-checking the public announcement and news of the company, I’ve noticed that ARBB had repeatedly mentioned about cloud business in their recent exposure in the market.
Article on NST: https://www.nst.com.my/business/2021/03/670349/arb-aims-ma-expand-clou...
Article on FocusMalaysia: https://focusmalaysia.my/featured/arb-sees-cloud-computing-as-its-magi...

Article on MalayMail: https://www.malaymail.com/section/money/mediaoutreach?release_id=65892
However, if you are familiar with the company, it is very likely that you wouldn’t find ANY cloud business on going on the company apart from it’s ERP and IoT business. So, if my suspicion is correct, the 13 million DBT that are crossed at the discount, are very likely to its future business partner, but it was not fixated if it’s a partner in the cloud game.
That being said, if ARBB would really venture into cloud, it’s share price would definitely skyrocket like DATAPRP, who is also linked with MyDigital cloud services!"

This would also explain the massive and relentless conversion of the PA warrants to the ARBB mother shares.
It was the company converting the PA shares.

Understand the rules before you make wild accusations just because the price does not go your way. The director did report his transactions.

ask yourself , as a major shareholder, why do u convert your PA into shares and add 19cts unless you have plan that the shares value will appreciate...otherwise it is cheaper to hold the PA and still control the company...

Has the dust settled for local technology sector? I believe so. For the past 2 months, tech-investors had suffered badly from the retracement of the whole technology sector. Some had rebounded and broken new highs, but most have not recovered to their previous high yet.
For tech-lovers, we all have one question in mind. Can we invest into technology stocks now? Well, it depends, really. Chart wise however, is showing a consolidation pattern now."

Sadly, investors are often chasing around flashy turnaround stories, but most of them does not materialize. And as a result, investors often lose their hard-earned money.
In my humble opinion and experience as an investor; we should focus on great companies with great earnings and asset light. That is especially true when you are targeting the high growth technology sector. So, how do we identify these companies? For this, I had created a list of technology companies with the highest market capitalization, which I believe their share price do speak volume when we are talking on a big cap level."

Without a doubt, these are great companies. But how about the valuation?
These 10 companies resulted in an industrial average PE of 52.109 times. Which of course, is acceptable for me given the growth they demonstrated. But the upside for these companies is limited – as the share price had on average doubled since the pandemic. What about smaller cap companies?"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=388","Apr 16, 2021 2:52 PM","kangedd","I would say approximately 20% of the valuation are coming from their market proposition – for example INARI, MPI and D&O being the market leader of each respective sub-sector of semiconductor, and another 30% for the stunning growth opportunity. Hence, on average, a decent technology company should be only priced at half of the valuation these companies enjoy – which is around 26.0545 or ≈ 26 times PE.
Next question – WHICH is a company that we need to choose? Definitely not from those loss-making “tech” counters. A counter however, stumbled across my watchlist when I was going through several press."

What is so special about this ARB Berhad (also known as “ARBB”)?
For the past 5 financial year, ARBB’s revenue had grown from a moderate 35.036 million to 219.454 million. More interestingly – their turned around from a 15.593 million loss to a 42.870 million profit!
Upon studying deeper on the company, it was then I know this is a undervalued gem that I had been looking for. Unlike the hardware players positioned in Asia’s Silicon Valley – Penang, this company was based in Kuala Lumpur and was software orientated. I was attracted by their unique business model of partnering up with Small & Medium Enterprises to provide them customized ERP software."

科技行业已经尘埃落定了吗？ 我相信在过去的两个月中，科技行业的投资者因整个科技行业的回撤而遭受了沉重打击。 一些公司已经开始反弹并打破了新的最高点，但是还是有大多数的公司还没恢复到之前的价位。
对于科技爱好者来说们来说， 我们在心里都有想着一个问题， 现在还可以投资科技股吗？ 要看看目前的情况吧。 从图表的角度来看，科技股现在显示出一种横盘模式。
通过对马来西亚证券交易所上市的90家科技公司的研究， 我发现90家中有46家没有任何盈利。 令人遗憾的是， 投资者经常跟风或追随着夸大的周转故事，其结果都不解人意。 结果，投资者都损失了血汗钱。
以我的作为投资者的经验， 我们应该专注于收入丰厚，资产轻盈的优秀公司。 尤其是你打算投资高增长与潜质的科技领域时。 那么，我们该如何识别这些好公司？ 我在这里分享一个市值最高的科技公司列表， 我相信这些公司都以股价证明了它们的地位。
选择这10家公司的原因是其规模，市场接受度和成熟的盈利能力。 毫无疑问，这些都是优秀的公司。 但是公司的真正估值又如何呢？
这10家公司的行业平均市盈率为52.109倍。 鉴于公司们所展示的成长与盈利，这结果对我来说是可以接受的。 但是这些公司的上涨空间非常有限， 因为自疫情以来，公司们的股价平均增长了一倍。 那么小资本的科技公司的表现呢？"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=388","Apr 19, 2021 12:06 PM","jinxstock20","大约有20％的估值来自于公司们的市场主张-例如，INAI，MPI和D＆O是半导体各个子行业的市场领导者， 另外30％则是令人震撼的增长机会。 因此，平均而言，一家体面的科技公司的估值应仅为公司目前估值的一半， 约为26.0545或市盈率的26倍。
下一个问题–我们应该选择哪个公司？ 绝对不是那些所谓亏损的“科技公司”。 但是，在我阅读了不少新闻文章后， 有一家公司吸引了我的注意。
大家都知道要入选在Deloitte的获奖名单是件多么困难的事， 当我发现ARB Berhad （前称为Aturmaju Resources Berhad）出现在名单时，我感到非常惊讶！ 该公司到底有何特别之处？
在过去的五个财政年度中， ARBB的收入从适3千503万增长到了2.19亿。 更有趣的是，他们从1559.3万的亏损转为4288.7万的盈利利！"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=388","Apr 19, 2021 12:06 PM","jinxstock20","在深入研究公司之后，我才知道这是我一直在寻找的被低估的公司。
ARBB和位于槟城的硬件公司们不同， 这家位于吉隆坡的公司主要以软件为主营业务。 该公司与中小企业合作，为中小企业们提供定制化ERP软件的独特商业模式吸引了我的主意。
众所周知，中小型企业很难拨出更多的营运资金来扩展他们的业务， 更不用说花费大量资金来投资ERP软件以简化其运营系统了。 通过这种合作方式，ARBB不仅可以将这些中小企业的资本支出降至最低，而且还可以利用这个优势提高中小企业的增长。
此外，ARBB还证明了自己的商业模式是可行的。 还有一个问题是，尽管该公司的利润达到了428.7百万的新高，但为什么每股收益却从11.46下降到9.55？
这时我注意到ARBB曾发行过不可赎回可转换优先股（ICPS）来筹集资金。 乍看之下，稀释效应使我几乎退缩了。 但是，到底是什么原因使得我继续研究这家公司？"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=388","Apr 19, 2021 12:06 PM","jinxstock20","ARBB的收入增长潜力使我留下来了。
该公司ICPS的发行量非常大， 在2018年12月19日，每持有1股ARBB的股东，将有权以每股ICPS 0.010的价格认购最多15股ICPS，实际上这笔现金被证明可以推动公司的成长。但是ICPS后的稀释作用又带来什么结果呢？
在发行ICPS之前，该公司的流通股总数为67,210,000，其中不包括认股权证的未来转换。 而ICPS的总数为15倍，总计1,008,150,000。
根据2021年4月14日为此，该公司目前的流通股总数为587,521,127。 换句话说，总共有520,311,127已从ICPS转换为ARBB的母股。 这意味着50％以上的ICPS已被转换， 因此股价稀释的作用已经减少了一半！
有些人可能会提出到，由于稀释作用，ARBB的市盈率现在已经很高了。 事实并非如此， 现在以每股0.355的价格，ARBB的市盈率仅为4.800倍！"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=388","Apr 19, 2021 12:07 PM","jinxstock20","以该公司的4287万为基准，假设ICPS已经完全转换成母股， ARBB的发行股票最大数量将为时1,075,360,000。 然后我们将其转换为每股收益， 约为每股0.03987。 那么新的市盈率是多少？
根据我的计算，应该是8.90倍。 还记得我之前所讨论过“正常”科技公司的估值吗？ 我们假设下一个财政年度ARBB没有增长， 并且由于缺乏市场的认可而减少了20％的估值。 市盈率的26倍的估值应该使ARBB的股价至少达到1.030， 这意味着从当前的股价，ARBB增长了200％！
那么为什么该公司的股价还没飞涨呢？
在我看来， 由于投资者们缺乏ICPS所带来稀释作用的知识。 另一个原因可能时ARBB的背后缺乏了使其股价上涨的炒股玩家。 因此，ARBB很难获取市场的认可。
但是， 对于那些通过我的文章并偶然发现这家公司的投资者们， 我希望这能、解打开你对ARBB的疑问。 是的，在编写本文章之前，我已经投资了该公司。 不过，我不希望以40、50甚至60仙的价格出售。我的目标价位是至少80仙，相当于ARBB稀释后的80%估值。
从技术分析的角度来看，该公司的股价目前在较低的斐波那契区间内盘整着。 同时，我们最近发现到有人正在积极的把ICPS积极转换为母股。 也许，也许吧。
最近将发生有趣的事？"

The partnership agreement was signed today by their respective subsidiaries, Arbiot Sdn Bhd and China Unicom Operation (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, ARB said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia.
China Unicom is the world’s fourth-largest mobile service provider by subscriber base, and is listed on the stock exchanges in New York, Hong Kong and Shanghai.
For FY19, China Unicom registered a profit after tax and minority interests of 11.3 billion yuan (RM7.1 billion), on the back of a revenue of 264.4 billion yuan (RM164.9 billion), said ARB.
Under the agreement, both parties agreed to collaborate in artificial intelligence, internet of things (IoT) and smart buildings platforms and applications in Malaysia.
The initial term of agreement is three years and will automatically renew on an annual basis.
In a press statement, ARB executive director Datuk Larry Liew Kok Leong said the knowledge-transfer from China Unicom will enhance the group’s IT offering solutions and services to its clients.
“We understand that China Unicom is going big in the area of 5G, with the construction of telecommunication towers and buildings. Our collaboration is timely, as Arbiot will contribute via its IT offering solutions to the projects. We have strong confidence that this augurs well for the prospects of the group,” said Liew.
He added: ""The partnership strategically aligns both companies for the long term by combining the strength of both entities with dedicated focus and expertise as a leading smart IoT player globally."""

Arbb has high receivable too as mainly it is putting a lot monies into JV. The JV is still at early stage it is too early to jump to any conclusions. Take note also it’s revenue increase a lot in last quarter in tandem with increase of receivable. Well we need to keep an eye on this but this need not become the only factor for comparison with London biscuit at this moment.
Bare in mind that London biscuit revenue dropped year to year but its receivables kept increasing year per year and double up in 5 years with very little or almost no written off.
Half of receivable of Arbb is in the age of 6 to 7 months. it is not warranted for write off yet. Just keep monitoring it. Be rational not to jump it and 100% liken it to London Biscuit. There is a lot discrepancies between both."

'Starting from scratch allows Mah Sing to put best practices in place from the get-go, giving the Group an advantage over its peers. This is where the glove manufacturing factory's strength lies as its production lines are all automated for higher efficiency. An Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system and advanced Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system is in place to support operations. The Group also ensures material environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors are considered starting from the initial stage of the venture.'
Proved that every new manufacturing factory / company (especially aiming for huge market) will implement Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. There is is huge market for ERP system in Malaysia during this Digital Transformation Era.
The question is whether ARBB take this opportunity to expand their client or just focus offering their service to their JV companies?
Many thought that u can just buy cheap ERP software for your company. But it will become obsolete in two or three years as it will need constant update and upgrade. Its is common for MNC or big aspiration company to hire subcontractor / specialize company to always modify to their need, maintain, upgrade and update their software (ERP cloud solution)

But if you understand a little deeper you may have a different opinion. The basic problem is the annual report lacks explanatory notes to the accounts receivables.
A few points need to be noted:
1, Dec 2019 trade receivable was RM29.7Mil
2, Dec 2020 trade receivable was RM132.4Mil of which RM64.1Mil was non current
3, 2020 revenue was RM219.5 Mil
My view:
A, The 2020 accounts receivable accounted for 60.3% of the 2020 revenue meaning the balance was settled.
B, The 2019 account receivable I can assume as fully settled otherwise they have to make a provision.
C, The issue, if I may call it, is the non current account receivable of RM 64.1Mil. This I have to assume as not overdue but more like a credit term of more than 12 months which you normally find in construction companies. Could this be the IOT project tie in to construction company?
D, If you are to look into IJM annual report you will find under non current assets the ""long term receivables"" that amounted to RM220.7Mil. I believe there is similarity to it and do we classify IJM as risky in terms of account receivable?
What we need is more information on the account receivable in the annual report.
As regards to individual project details I doubt other listed companies provided such info."

Why anybody wants to do that, hide themselves, they must be trying to pull off something.

Other counter such as CENSOF with smaller profit able to give dividends. Sometime dividends can attract investor and show company confident on it earning capability, this will push the share price."

Revenue of RM49.5mill is made up of RM38 mill sales with credit term of 12 months or more and RM11.5Mill sales are with credit term of 6 months+/-
The qtr AR collections are RM38.8mill
Dec'20 non current assets AR=64.1 mill & current Assets AR =68.2Mill
Non current Asset trade receivables =64.1+38=RM102.1Mill since no collections made due to 12 mths credit term or more
Current Asset trade receivables =68.2+11.5-38.8= RM40.9Mill
So in total for the quarter there are revenue of RM49.5 mill with collections of RM38.8mill.
If the trade receivables under current assets are not paid after more than 12 months they will still stay under current assets and not transferred to Non current Assets. Maybe under this scenario there will be impairment lost.
For the non current trade receivables we wont be seeing any impairment loss until year 2022, if any."

The Receivables movement= 102.1+40.9-64.1-68.2-7.1=3.6(unfavourable)
Or alternatively looked via revenue & collections=49.5-38.8-7.1=3.6
You will never see the 38.8 mil in the financial statements as most numbers are netted off.
If the credit term of 12 months or more is the new business model, short term the cashflow will not be nice until things regularise after 12 mths. Then the regular pattern will set in. This is sort of initial investment period and very much dependent on the financial stability of the customers."

Why? Perhaps it was because of the surreal earnings growth of the company or due to the complex nature of derivatives issued by the company, such as ICPS."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=395","May 24, 2021 1:49 PM","ryoyagod","Nevertheless, today we will focus on the quarterly performance of ARBB and less about the debates. Of course, if you are interested, feel free to look up in the forum for multiple write up by other content writers."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=395","May 24, 2021 1:49 PM","ryoyagod","Let’s get started.
Revenue and profit
For the first quarter in financial year 2021, the company had made MYR 49.49 million in revenue. As explained in the segmented analysis of the company, the revenue is mostly coming from ERP segment (81%) and the rest are from IoT segment."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=395","May 24, 2021 1:50 PM","ryoyagod","In the first quarter of last financial year, the company did not have clear distinction between ERP and IoT as it was just changing from timber to IT businesses.
The revenue had achieved a year-on-year growth of 48%. This is admirable in the sense that the company is still able to perform well under the pressure of COVID-19 and several lock downs. Investors should also be aware that the ERP sector of ARBB is closely related to other small and medium businesses, and the IoT sector is somewhat related to the construction sector. The downturn of whole economy in Malaysia had depressed the recovery in small and medium businesses, which ultimately affected ARBB."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=395","May 24, 2021 1:50 PM","ryoyagod","However still, the company’s growth is impressive.
That being said, the company had seen a 31% decrease in revenue when compared to the fourth quarter in financial year 2020, which in that quarter alone, the company had a revenue of MYR 72.46 million, which is the historical high for the company.
As explained by the management, the drop was mainly caused by lower revenue contribution from the ERP segment – which is acceptable under the current circumstances."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=395","May 24, 2021 1:51 PM","ryoyagod","As for the profit of the company, ARBB had MYR 6.83 million in current quarter and have little to no changes when compared to the previous year results. However, on the quarterly basis, the company had seen a decreased by 65% in profit as in fourth quarter of financial year 2021, the company had historical high in both revenue and profit.
And bear in mind, in the fourth quarter, it is easily the most liberating timeframe of our country in terms of control measures to contain the virus. Hence, I was not surprised to see a drop in this quarter comparatively."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=395","May 24, 2021 1:51 PM","ryoyagod","Cash flows
Investors should also take a look at the operating cash flow of ARBB.
Despite the naysays of some forum pundits, the company DID make some positive cash – which indicates that they do not have a huge problem on the trade receivables, at least not to the extent to what these people are claiming. They are improving significantly as of now.
In this quarter alone, we also see huge sum of capital raised from investors who are converting the ICPS into mother share by paying 20 cents per share. A simpler understanding on it would be – investors are getting more interested in the prospects of ARBB and hence that is why they would invest heavily into it.
As they say, look at where they put their money to and not where they claim to be."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=395","May 24, 2021 1:51 PM","ryoyagod","Valuation
Now, valuation can be a bit tricky when it comes to ARBB. Do you know why is that so?
Due to the nature of ICPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in circulation might change quarter to quarter. For example, in the first quarter for financial year 2020, the shares in circulation were 293,792 million and 586,229 in the current quarter. To prevent confusion, we will use the maximum potential dilution impact as a way of calculation.
The maximum number of circulations in the market would be 1,075,360,000. Assuming this is the worst performance by ARBB (which is most likely), they might hit 30 million in net profit for the full year, which under the maximum dilutive effect, the EPS would be 2.79 cents. Which, under the current price, the PE ratio would be approximately 10.75 times.
In the technology board, the average PE ratio for technology companies are easily 30 times. Even if we take half off it off and factor in the maximum dilution effect, the true value of ARBB should be at least 42 cents, representing a steep 29% discount now.
I agree the graph do look scary, but remember the term be greedy when others are fearful? Yea, I think this could be the MOMENT."

Estimated gross merchandised value (“GMV”) of RM20m. The contract is valid on a yearly recurring basis.
ARB to provide a marketplace platform to YESS to sell and market their products efficiently by implementing a customized ERP System and System Integration Solution (“SIS”). The SIS features include real-time sales tracking, real-time sales and inventory sales interlinking, inventory management, assortment selection and forecast, warehousing, and logistic optimization.
Based on checks, we understand that YESS markets and distributes electronic products via several outlets in Klang Valley.
Author’s remark: A price tag of RM20m for the deployment of an ERP solution seems absurd. No details were shared on what does it mean by RM20m GMV. How much revenue is ARB expected to recognize from the project? What is the quantum of expected yearly recurring income? The lack of disclosure raises our concerns on the management trustworthiness and genuineness of the contract. To date, no information was shared by the management on the progress of the project.
Mar 2019 – RM78m IoT Solution (Smart Home) – Perkasa Selalu Sdn Bhd (“PSSB”)
The total contract sum of RM78m comprises IoT works, RM27.3m (35%), and outsourced construction works, RM50.7m (65%). ARB assists with identifying and outsourcing construction work to third party/(ies).
The contract involves the development of a single tower serviced apartment comprising 39 commercial and 286 residential units.
Based on disclosures, PSSB incorporated in Perak in 2014 has a paid-up capital of RM2 only. The directors are Chin Kok Hoong and Chin Kok Foong.
Author’s remark: Like above, RM27.3m for implementation of IoT solution for 325 units seem overly inflated at about RM84k per unit. Even so when compared to the estimated construction cost of ~RM170k per unit. Furthermore, PSSB’s director, Chin Kok Foong is believed to be Dato’ Sri Chin Kok Foong. Dato’ Sri Chin has personal ties with Dato’ Sri Liew as they both are the current executive director of Ageson. Similarly, no information was shared by the management on the progress of the project to date.
May 2019 – RM18m IoT project (Smart Home) – IJ Ventures Sdn Bhd
The total contract sum of RM18m comprises IoT works, RM6.3m (35%) and outsourced construction works, RM11.7m (65%). The contract involves the construction and deployment of IoT for 130 units single-storey terrace houses in Perak.
Based on checks, IJ Ventures is a company involved in construction works, building contractors, and property development.
Author’s remark: RM6.3 million for the deployment of IoT for 130 houses would be equivalent to RM48.4k per house. The amount seems overstated. If IJ Ventures themselves are building contractors, why would they need to appoint ARB to outsource a portion of construction works when they have their own expertise/network? Similarly, no information was shared by the management on the progress of the project to date.
Jul 2019 – RM600m IoT project (Smart water filtration system) – Shuifa IoT Tech Co., Ltd
The project involves the application of IoT-enabled hardware and software to the printed circuit board of household water filtration system to enable data exchange and remote control of water temperature etc.
The project value of RM600m was arrived at on the estimation of 300,000 households. Tenure is 2 years for implementing the first phase (300,000 households) of the project. No further disclosures were made on the project location and project progress etc to date."

For what i see why arbb trade receivable would be high is because of their business model. For ERP, they are providing software services, as this might be in term of 5years service and they might enter into some agreement, payment would only be paid after the service (if it is satisfaction). For IOT smart building, this is more obvious that it would categorize in trade receivable and would be under non current asset (most probably) because their system would only available at the very end of the completion of 1 building, so they might need to wait for the high rise building to be almost complete, they just able to provide their services and install their stuff. Normally one high rise building would take 4years to build up. The trade receivable occur to be after they make partnership with China Unicom, so it might be one of the reason why their trade receivable increase because of getting some big IOT contract with this company.
Back to serbadk, as you all can see its last quarter report havent out yet due to unverified item. Becareful on SCIB as well because its QR also havent release yet. For Kpower, it is out, but you all can see it is audited till 30/6/2020 only. Quite fishy. Not like arbb already audited till 31/12/2020. This you can find from the latest QR when they making the comparison with audited report.
By the way, this is just my own thought. Is your own choice to choose to invest or not. Hope that all of you have a great journey on investing. ^^"

现在大家都把目光都集中在“卡林主题股票”上，目前看来这位巨人已经倒下了。 至今，粗略计算拿督莫哈卡林的投资组合在一天内损失了约 5 亿令吉。
上图是在投资者社交圈内被大量分享的热门图片。
那么，在这里要说的另一个被低估的公司是哪家公司呢？ 幸运的是， 由于政府实施了 从2021年6月1日开始的14日全面MCO， 该公司的股价与昨天同步下跌了约5%。
这家公司是ARB Berhad（“ARBB”）， 自 2018年以来一直是我主要的投资项目。 大多数投资者都熟悉这家由新管理层接手后，从一个处于衰退中的木材公司转变为一家带来盈利的科技公司。 尽管该公司先前获得了骄人的业绩，但该公司最近的季度业绩影响了其成长。
当业绩好的时候， 大家都不会加仓或买进。 而业绩不理想时， 投资者们都在抛售股票。 ARBB的抛售压力也非常大， 这就是ARBB的现状。 如果你查看了该公司的技术分析， 你会发现情况可能会略有不同。
我目前使用着布林带，A/D, ADX and Smart MCDX来观察趋势以及公司的资金流向。 从上图中， 我们可以见到公司的资金流向, 而Smart MCDX则显示出资金正在流出中。 但是，如果我仅根据这两个指标进行着交易，那几年前我一定会失败。
资金流是我衡量公司投资者动向的方式，而ADX和布林带则是用来执行交易的时期。 在布林带方面， 我使用了EMA 50作为指标的中点， 显然可以见到该公司开盘很大，并且尾盘价在布林带低处反弹（中间趋势线的-2倍）。 尽管ADX仍低于典型的 40.0范围，但仍显示出与股价和资金流动相反的力量。 这可以被理解为ARBB的短期或日内投资者逐渐的退出了， 留下的是对公司有信心的投资者。 大家只要看一下今天的交易量，交易量非常的低， 已经不会在变得更低了。
因此， 我认为ARBB的下行风险在当前价格上非常的稳定。 ARBB的即时阻力将是0.300令吉， 支撑点为当前水平。 不过，任何有经验的投资者都可以在昨天市场收盘前10分钟建立自己的头寸。 然而，如果本周该公司的股价超过0.300 令吉，ARBB一定会很快回升至0.350至 0.400令吉的区域，这意味着18%-30%的回报。

=================================
thanos2020 Somewhere ard mid of Mar 21, I believed Liew converted aome of his ICPS to become the mothershare...I read it somewhere (correct me if I am wrong).. It is much cheaper for him to convert his ICPS than to buy from the market...
==================================
Reading between the lines, senior management occasionally convert their ICPS options into stock then sell (or is it transfer) on the open market at a ""high"" price to buy their properties, cars, etc. and all the ""faithful"" rush in to buy.
I need something like that in my life."

Plus if they can collect huge chunk of the receivable, they will have pile of cash ..giving good dividends should not be an issue.
The different between SERBADK and ARBB is.... ARBB do not have any loan. Net cash company, even if they take longer or unable to collect the trade receivable, this company will not become bad debt or be delist.
There is a lot of other good company which their share stagnant or still lingering at low PE such LAGENDA, HTPADU, KPS, FIAMMA, DPS, TRC and EUPE. while their EPS is good, investor always oversight some of them. The nearest example MMCCORP for month the share price are low (around RM 1) with PE 8-12. After announce want to privatize then a lot of investors realize that it should value around RM 2- RM 3 (it will value higher as Penang port (under MMCCROP) just got free commercial zone status which will increase their revenue).
After include the trade receivable issue, i still value ARBB better than Censor, Smetric and Sedania or even DATAPREP. Bursa not always about FA, PE or EPS. Speculations play a huge influence."

- If they are good debt meaning they are recoverable/collectible on due dates(2022) then it will turn out to be value investing except that the credit period is exceptionally long. So in the next 2-3 quarters the non current AR will continue to increase as there won't be any payment as I am assuming a credit term of at least 12 months. As such we wont be seeing any provision or impairment loss on the non current AR in 2021(my guess, until we get more clarity or the customer collapsed before due date)
-if the debts are mostly irrecoverable later on(2022) then it can fall under fraud or bad business risk. That will be a subject for another day.
The main problem is the lack of clarity on the nature of the non current AR. That is causing the jitters and uncertainty.
To me the PA is a non issue but actually helps in the company cashflow. To counter the increasing conversion the company just need to earn more to offset the dilution.
As such investing in ARBB at this point is a calculated risk as to how one perceive the non current AR."

A downturn in commodities is expected to come as the pent-up demand has its limit, the supply glut is no more than an illusion of difficulty of shipping and fear-based hoarding. Palm oil, being the beneficiary of rise in price of soybean oil, could hardly see the sustainability of the price in the next 6 months.
Foreword.
The company that is under our investment radar is ARB BERHAD (KLSE:7181), or simply known as ARBB. The company had transformed from a timber based, loss-making company to a highly profitable technology company. ARBB’s solid growth and low single digit PER had attracted our interest to study deeper into it.
Fundamentals
For the trailing 4 quarters of the company, ARBB had a total sum of RM43.4 million in net profit. This translate to an EPS of 7.14 and based on the LTP price of ARBB of RM0.290, the company is trading at a 4.06x PER. However, the EPS of ARBB could subject to dilution due to the potential conversion of ICPS."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=398","Jun 14, 2021 3:49 PM","neonstrife","Share dilution
Our calculation cited that appx 541 million ICPS are not converted yet. This indicates the potential dilution of ARBB is limited. The pro-forma dilution on EPS would be appx 4.26, which would translate to a 6.80x PER.
Technical movement
In tandem with the FMCO announcement, the share price of ARBB had fallen from a RM0.320 to RM0.415 range to RM0.290. The breach of key support of RM0.300 (e.S1) had triggered an exit for traders. However, based on the stabilization of share price on RM0.280 level (S1), it is very likely that the strong holders are accumulating during weakness.
Value on hand
An industry average PER for technologies companies under Main Board of Bursa Malaysia is appx 43.12 times. With ARBB lower-than-peer PER of 4.06x (pro-forma dilution 6.80x), there are much value to be uncovered from the investment. We recommend a strong BUY on ARBB with a TP of RM0.855 with 20.0x PER base on a more-than 50% discount on industry average."

Investor’s preference had once again back to the long-term-winner theme – technology board. Stocks like VS and UWC both had announced their quarterly report yesterday and I must say, the results are very promising and foreshadows a great upside ahead for the sector.
However, being manufacturers always have the capacity limit and shipment problem. Fortunately, this hidden champion that we are sharing today does not limit itself in the manufacturing field – but instead, is a very promising software company with extremely low valuation – ARB BERHAD (KLSE:ARBB)."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=399","Jun 16, 2021 5:15 PM","soonning65","As broad as the technology already is – it is also extremely wide for the software sub-segment itself. So, what does ARBB do?
ARBB principally involved in Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) and Internet of Things (IoT) software development, customization, and implementation. With digitization getting on track, businesses that are unable to utilize data are losing track of costs, profits and inefficiencies, and worst of all, might see diminishing market share as their competitor are improving."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=399","Jun 16, 2021 5:16 PM","soonning65","Technically, businesses need ERP system – sooner or later.
The Malaysian ERP landscape is not saturated but dominated by a few of the big names, such as SAP, Oracle and NetSuite, Microsoft, Infor, and IFS. Do not get me wrong but ERP are not cheap, based on 2019’s market research, a basic implementation of ERP could easily cost approximately USD 100,000 to USD 150,000 – and this is only the baseline of it."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=399","Jun 16, 2021 5:17 PM","soonning65","Why does it cost so much?
With big names dominating the industry, it is not a wonder why ERP is being “manipulated”. However, we understand that ARBB does the design and develop cloud ERP system for their clients while offering an extremely low entry point for them. ARBB could profit from several aspects after the implementation of the software.
Addon costs for unique function or API.
Provision of support, troubleshooting and cloud services.
Data management and advisory.
The edge of ARBB is definitely on the pricing end and down-to-earth application as the business itself is localized. However, ARBB might not be as “famous” as the big names, but judging from the revenue growth, It is pretty obvious that the company is gaining traction."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=399","Jun 16, 2021 5:17 PM","soonning65","A five-year study on the company’s past performance would note that ARBB had a revenue CAGR of 58%. We were not able to derive the CAGR for profit after tax due to financial year 2016 was in a loss. But you get the idea when a company turned around from making 16 million losses per year to 42 million in profit after tax in 5 years."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=399","Jun 16, 2021 5:17 PM","soonning65","Obviously, ARBB’s growth was outstanding, and it surpasses majority of the industry, and belong to the far-end of a bell graph on the high growing side.
As for the IoT segment for the company, the company had 3 sub-division, namely Smart Building, Smart Home and Smart Water Supply Management Solutions. Some of you might not be aware, but more and more developers are adding the “Smart Home”, a.k.a. voice-controlled electronics as a unique selling point for properties.
Well, ARBB definitely could do that, but it is not that shallow. In the Smart Building sub-division, the company provide engineering, procurement, commissioning (EPC) services to property developer and contractor. The company also helps to integrate automated systems for smart buildings, like installing wire, wireless and mechatronic works.
A Smart Home concept is even more straightforward. For simplicity’s sake, a Smart Home features the ability to have a centralized and remove monitoring and control over electronic appliances, which could be further integrated into your phone’s app. And lastly, the ARBB Smart Water Supply Management Solution provides holistic management on software, hardware of water metering system, and provides data analysis on billing, consumption analysis, maintenance cycle and so forth.
Technically, ARBB could collaborate with GKENT on water metering business.
Some notable developments of the company are:
A Joint Venture with Orange Social Media Sdn Bhd. (ERP)
A business development contract of USD 20 million with Tatan Land Co Ltd. (ERP)
A MoA with Shuifa IoT Tech Co Ltd for 600 million worth of smart house water filtration system.
A solar project with University Sains Malaysia to install, operate and manage < 1 MW solar photovoltaic system.
Business contract with IJ Ventures Sdn Bhd for contract value of 18 million.
LOA from AGES for IoT SEPCM project for 260 units of services apartment for total contract value of 60 million.
Joint Venture agreement with Perkasa Selalu Sdn Bhd for IoT SEPCM project for 78 million.
It looks good on the business perspective as well as the financial calculations. But how about the underlying assets and liabilities?"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=399","Jun 16, 2021 5:18 PM","soonning65","Technically, all debt indicators are not applicable to ARBB due to its debt free nature. Based on the current price of 29 cents per share, the company arrives at a market cap of 176 million, with net cash of 57 million. A quick enterprise value calculation would put ARBB to approximately 119 million in value.
I had run multiple simulations on the expected earnings and EV/EBITDA valuation, and none of them actually surpasses the 5 times mark. How is it possible that a company with great business, great earnings but terrible pricing by the market?"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=399","Jun 16, 2021 5:18 PM","soonning65","Certainly, the market had overlooked this hidden champion.
I have come to note that there are ill-intentioned individuals or PAC trying to defame the company and drive the share price flat, or down. These people are considered as “operator” in the market and was not penalized due to their anonymous nature. However, I think a good company certainly do not deserve the treatment from the investment community.
Based on my rough calculation on EV/EBITDA based on 30 million conservative EBITDA per annum, here is the expected outcome of ARBB’s share price “theoretical” performance.
Current valuation dated 16th June 2021 – 3.9 times.
8 times EV/EBITDA – 250 million market cap (39 cents)
10 times EV/EBITDA – 300 million market cap (49 cents)
12 times EV/EBITDA – 360 million market cap (59 cents)"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=399","Jun 16, 2021 5:19 PM","soonning65","Theoretically, every 2 times increase in EV/EBITDA – which is purely investor’s sentiment would result in 10 cents higher in ARBB’s share price. Sadly, the company is trading at 29 cents at the very moment. A very conservative idea of 39 cents would result in 34% in ROI, and based on historical share price performance, 39 cents is definitely achievable, not to mention ARBB is currently a laggard behind the technology sector.
This led me wonder, when would ARBB truly freed from the curse of undervalued? But from an investor’s point of view, the current pricing is definitely CHEAP and SAFE to enter!!

You will realize that arbb is slowly improving in Fundamental
You guys must get so many thrills watching the share price zooming up or down by 0.05 sen. How do you manage to contain your excitement?
In the meantime, the only news you get is:
Conversion of Irredeemable Convertible Preference Shares to Ordinary Shares
No. of shares issued under this corporate proposal: 305,000
Issue price per share ($$) Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) 0.2000
Par Value($$) (if applicable) Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) 0.000
Units: 608,217,400
Issued Share Capital ($$) Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) 123,949,333.000
So you watch your share value being diminished every few weeks
In the meantime, no words of comfort from the CEO when the receivables will be received.
