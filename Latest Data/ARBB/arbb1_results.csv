"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=7","Jan 18, 2019 1:01 AM","tonyS","I think if mother share RM 0.60, reasonable ICPS price will be around RM 0.41, cause conversion top up RM 0.19. The price different of Mother share and ICPS should around RM 0.19. For example, if mother share RM 0.60 and ICPS RM 0.20, then investor will probably go for ICPS, cause can top up RM 0.19, total cost RM 0.39 and sell it RM 0.60 for profit. The risk is, ICPS conversion takes one to two weeks. But if the counter fundamental is good, suppose the share price won't drop too much during few weeks. Even if it does, you still holding a mother share with lower cost. Well, losing money maybe, but not as 'hurt' as those RM 0.60. Investment always come with risk. :)
In other words, if ICPS price different more than RM 0.19 compare with mother share, sooner or later, the price gap will narrow down to around RM 0.19.
So those who want to TP from ICPS, will just sell it, no need to convert into Mother share for profit.
One thing good about ICPS compare with Warrant is, upon maturity, warrant will lapse and warrant holder lose all money. As for ICPS, it will mandatory convert into mother share by combining 20 ICPS into 1 mother share. At least investor get something compare with higher risk warrant.
Those who have faith with Q4 and 2018 financial result, perhaps will hold the share and wait for next wave. I check back the corporate exercise happen last year for Aturmju, apparently their timber business cannot profit already, very high chance they diversify to IT business then convert into technology counter. Major reason is Timber business keep losing money, IT business make huge profit, another reason is Technology counter usually get way higher PE ratio, if I not mistaken, should be around 22 times.
https://www.ceicdata.com/en/malaysia/bursa-malaysia-price-earnings-rat...
Industrial counter PE ratio only 16 times.
From their ICPS prospectus, it mentioned that unbill invoice around RM 4.4M. Another RM 9 M project in discussion. Q3 profit RM 186K. Assuming their Q4 profit few Million, very likely this Aturmaju will turn into profit counter after so many years of losses. The IT diversification only happen during Q3 2018. During two quarter, they can make this kind of result, very good already. High hope for 2019. Now the uncertain is the MoU that just announced yesterday, RM 20M yearly sales is very good figure, provided Aturmaju can successfully sign the contract. If is remain only MoU.... then too bad. So those who wanna bet on this MoU and their 2018 profit, can go ahead to buy in. I myself will probably wait till at least the RM 20M project signed or they announce profit Q4 result (preferably few Million profit, if only couple of ten thousand, may not so attractive, IMO). My risk tolerance kind of low, haha. Low profit , low risk suit me more. Also if the RM 20M project contract signed, by looking at the technology counter PE ratio, Aturmaju share price still have huge room to increase, so no hurry.
Happy trading mate."

I check previous announcement and available information, 2018 profit almost everything from quarter 4, which they started diversified into technology. Assuming they only able to maintain the performance, means 2019 profit will be RM 16.88M. Technology category company PE is easily 30 times."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=12","Mar 3, 2019 10:43 PM","Journey to Financial Independence","Personally, i dont think it will back to 0.60 per shares in a very short timeframe. This mainly due to the conversion of preference shares to mother shares will lead to selling pressure as traders can instantly make fat profit (due to a huge discount).
However, if you pull to a mid to longer timeframe (after factor in financial performance etc.) there is a possibility to move beyond RM100million market cap or even higher, which equivalent more than 1 ringgit per shares (based on latest market shares).
So, its basically your choice to buy/sell/hold. I didnt encounter such a hidden gem in the market since few years back which easily can make us bucket of gold. You can either make money from PA or mother. Do read my recent articles whether to pick PA or mother and you guys also can download stockbit and read ryunanda's post regarding on PA vs mother to get a clearer picture."

First of all, PA and aturmajur is a different listed entity there is no active market making mechanism, unless you want to be one. Secondly, selling down 118million you know how to sell it in this atur maju pa? Perhaps you can do it from air. 15million highest transacted volume thus far, consecutively sell for 10days is possible though provided there are so many illogical ppl like you to park and buy it each level 1million buyqueue can last till PA become negative."

I'll sell when my remisier sells his 500k shares. I trust him, because he's not the type to buy very volatile stocks, and he really hates punting on them.
I bought at 0.335 and I have topped up twice ever since; 0.35 and 0.395. Thus, my average price is 0.341.
If you read what I wrote at 11:04 am, I said more to come in 40-90 days. Something is definitely brewing behind the scene but it's done ever so slowly. It can happen two weeks from now, although it seems quite unlikely.
If waiting is your game, then this counter might be the one for you.

ARB Bhd’s posted a record net profit of RM5.076 million in its first quarter ended March 31, contributed substantially by the stronger top line of its information technology segment.
… Our FY19 is off to an excellent start driven by the continued high demand for our IT solutions in the areas of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system and Internet of Things (IoT) Intelligent Lifestyle concept.
… Our profit in 1QFY19 is generated from our recurring-income business model, which I believe has reflected in two consecutive quarters. With a market capitalisation of less than RM50 million, I strongly believe ARB is undervalued by the investing community.

You are wrong, When the price high due to the ARB result was out at after 2 pm the same day. Only when the system show breakout out TA come first and OTB will start looking into the FA.
FA was only the preliminary view from account general summary and the content detail still need time to review by OTB.
The closing price on the same day was 0.53 and you can chase the price till 0.605 if you want.
What if next day price corrected below 0.53 before it went up further, what would you say again.
I am one of the OTB subscribers but i still have to look into the situation even though it is a call buy.
I did not buy ARB because the final result had yet to compile by OTB. At last, OTB had asked you to forget about this stock and it wont be too late for you to do so.
OTB's direction is only the indication, when it is alert, what you have to do is to pay more attention to this stock. Paying more attention doesn't mean you must go in. At least the counter is triggered"

I had to sell 10 lots yesterday because of something stupid I did that same day, so I'm left with 22,000 shares at 0.363 per piece.
That's why I'm unmoved by many negative commentators here. I bought some when it was trading at 0.335, and topped up twice or thrice along the way, way before OTB or whoever it was that made that buy call before losing his cojones the next day or two.
Here's my advice: if you want to be a trader, go and learn from a trader. If you want to be an investor, go and learn from one. Whichever one you choose, don't just think about profits. You must allow yourself a fixed amount of cut-loss too, say -10%.
Shit gets really hard when you want to be an investor but you go and learn from a trader or vice-versa, and you don't have any exit strategy at all, especially cut-loss."

KUALA LUMPUR: Shares of ARB Bhd rose more than 1% in early trade after a technical buy by PublicInvest Research.
ARB, formerly known as Aturmaju Resources Bhd, rose 1.03%, or 0.5 sen to 49 sen with 5.8 million shares done. ARBB-PA gained 2.38%, or 0.5 sen to 20.5 sen.
PublicInvest said ARBB was staging a potential recovery from its congestion phase well supported by its short term EMA.
It said its RSI was trending upward while its weekly MACD formed a golden crossover a week earlier.
“Hence, both momentum and trend are anticipated to be improved in near term.""
“Should resistance level of 53 sen be broken, it may continue to lift price higher to subsequent resistance level of 57 sen,” PublicInvest said.
“However, failure to hold on to support level of 47 sen may indicate weakness in the share price and hence, a cut-loss signal,” it added.
It said the stop loss level was at 51.5 sen."

Those who bought at 0.395 - 0.4 will feel happy, but they dont know something is gonna happen. Operator has left this stock since the release of QR last month, this action is so obvious. Until now, there is still no operator willing to accumulate and push it up higher, just look at the breakdown of sideway recently.
Another thing is, the pe is so low, do u guys think it really cheap? Hmmm, just go and check those low pe stocks, look at how's their performance of stock prices, and look at how they manipulate their financial statement to overstate profits and understate charges. Over thousands of PA will be listed on market in this coming weeks, will those holders hold it if the price continues to drop, hence i foresee another selling wave is coming, but it would be a mild selling wave.
Last but not least, something is gonna happen on ARBB, that why sellers dumped from 0.6 all the way to 0.395 despite the turnaround QR results and recent development on the business (still remember how stock price reacted to solar energy news)? And many people trapped at higher price, hence, do u guys think operator will help you to get out of trap in near short term? They are not charity organization, think about it.
This is my personal view on this stock, i have sold all of my holding at 0.595 when everyone is so greedy and optimistic about this stock, still remember how crazy are those retailers when the price broke 0.6? The purpose of buying stocks is to make money, not to donate money and make people rich.

May 23, 2018
Multi-level marketing or MLM has become more active on the web as time moves on. The direct sales world experienced major success by allowing others to promote the product. The problem is many MLM businesses are attempting to employ these winning tactics in today’s world without the essential technical support needed to make MLM goals work online as Au Yee Boon points out.
Who is Au Yee Boon?
Au Yee Boon is relatively well-known in circles within the MLM world. He has been actively attempting to create software that would make things easier for MLM organizations when working online.
His company, Techbase Solution, is a popular Malaysian software that provides basic and complex solutions for MLM organizations that are either completely online or are using online tools to reach salespeople as well as potential customers. One thing this company accomplishes is securing a site using state-of-the-art coding, which helps protect the identities of those involved. Of course, these are just some of the solutions his company offers, but there are many more aimed to help MLM organizations get out of their own way.
Au Yee Boon says that “it is frustrating to me when I see a company that would seem to have all of the elements in place to really be successful in marketing or direct sales world,” but these companies continue to get in their own way. Boon mentions that some “are missing out because their software is letting them down.” Sometimes, the problem is that the organization’s owner loves to take on many tasks to reduce costs. This leads them to skip software support or buy something sub part. This can end up hurting an MLM organization in a few ways given enough time.
Things That Au Sees MLM Leaders Overlook
User Experience
One thing that some companies do not pay much attention to is user experience. Online users, customers, and salespeople expect a certain level of fluidity from a site. Not having an easy-to-navigate site or one that does not adapt well to different screens sends the wrong message. It tells visitors that the site is outdated and not tended to. Part of what Techbase Solution offer is a design team that is going to constantly test the site of an MLM organization to ensure optimal user experience.
Platform for Tomorrow’s Currency
There is no doubt about it, most people agree that e-coins are going to become the currency of tomorrow. This world offers many benefits to MLM organizations, especially the ones online. Cryptocurrency opens up many doors. This is one reason Au’s company offers a variety of solutions, modules, and plugins to make e-trading and cryptocurrency exchange just a little easier. MLM organizations should not ignore this change for its own good.
Managed Security
An MLM organization is going to be granting site access to several people, not only customers but direct sales people too. This means the site is going to be holding a lot of personal information, which needs to be protected. The problem is that some companies skim on this and end up putting their visitors in unnecessary danger of identity theft. Part of what Techbase Solution offer is a managed encrypted security system designed for MLM organizations.
Au Yee Boon hopes that more companies do their best to pay attention to their software as much as they pay attention to their business growth plan. Every piece of an MLM is a building block, and one cracked block could jeopardize the entire structure. Seeing things this way can make it easier to understand why something like software and online support is important."

May 02, 2017
KUALA LUMPUR (May 2): Trive Property Group Bhd will work with Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) to develop a solar farm with a gross development value of RM150 million, through a collaboration agreement between the university and VSolar Group Bhd.
In a statement today, Trive said under the project, it will support VSolar by supplying solar components such as solar panels, solar inverters, battery chargers, batteries, solar pumps, mounting frames, trackers and accessories.
On April 11, UTM and VSolar had signed a joint venture (JV) agreement to develop solar energy generation facilities and conduct research and development (R&D) activities into commercialisation of renewable energy technologies. UTM will provide suitable site of approximately 20 acres per 10 megawatts (MW) for solar energy generation facilities up to a capacity of 30MW.
Trive executive director Kua Khai Shyuan said it is confident of adding value to the overall objective of the JV between UTM and VSolar in developing the solar farm.
""This will strengthen Trive in the solar industry and will definitely boost Trive's revenue stream in our group's renewable energy sector,"" he added.
In a separate development, Trive is collaborating with China's Hubei Guang Bo New Energy Co Ltd (HGB) to conduct R&D and produce power generation systems such as off-gird/grid-connected wind power generation system, solar power generation system and wind-solar complementary power generation system.
Trive said it has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with HGB last month. Under the MoU, HGB will supply the technical know-how for the production of the various systems.
Trive, on the other hand, will provide a 2.5-acre factory site in Kulim, Kedah, to serve as a base station to conduct normal course of business.
Shares of Trive closed half a sen or 3.23% higher at 16 sen today, for a market capitalisation of RM213.86 million."

Thursday, 1 Mar 2018
KUALA LUMPUR: Vsolar Group Bhd and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) mutually terminated their joint venture to develop solar energy facilities due to the poor rates of returns.
Vsolar, which is involved in solar renewable energy, announced on Thursday both parties decided on the termination based on the financial viability of the proposed project.
“Our financial assessment of the proposed tariffs potentially to be awarded by the regulators indicated poor rates of return on our potential investment,” it said.
On April 11, 2017, the company said the JV – in which it would hold 80% and UTM 20% – would develop the facilities with a capacity of up to 30 megawatts.
The JV was also to undertake research and development on solar energy generation technology and solar plant installation and construction design.
The project was to have been built on a site of about 20 acres for every 10 MW to be identified and provided by UTM."

Getting into the stock market can be a bit scary. You are entering a new world, but you can take advantage of all it has to offer. Au Yee Boon believes the opportunities are there, but they do come with a number of risks, which stops many people from moving forward. You can use the following expert-curated tips to sniff out a good stock.
Looking at the Company’s Business Model
Profits do not always mean longevity. Sometimes, a company’s profits are low because they are investing their revenue in development or research. This could be a sign that the company is looking to be here for a long time rather than just making a quick buck.
The founder of One of the most successful IT Solution company in Asia, Techbase Solution Sdn. Bhd., Au Yee Boon, says it is frustrating when a company is “missing out because their software is letting them down.” He believes a company, even an MLM, that does not invest in itself or its software is simply not living up to its potential and will likely fail. This is definitely the kind of company you do not want to invest.
Reading Into the Company’s Management Report
Every company, even MLMs, should be releasing annual reports, and these documents can be used to your advantage. These reports rely on management to help detail how the company has been doing during the reporting year. You get to see how the company was able to perform well or why it underperformed. These reports are also used to help you see how the company is going to address issues in the future and how it plans to grow. What you want to see is a company that has a concrete plan for its future and is mature enough to address issues effectively.
Now, diving into some of this information over and over again to find a good stock to purchase may be challenging at first. Most people have a hard time understanding what they are doing while others simply lose interest at some point. It is important that you stick with it because stocks can really revolutionize your lifestyle in all the ways you’d hope they would."

June 17, 2019
A few days ago, Yuetai Co., Ltd. (600393.SH) was highly concerned by the market for its 6.4 billion project “Broken Arm Survival”. In fact, the reporters of the Changjiang Commercial Daily found that several real estate projects of Yuetai Co., Ltd. had serious violations of regulations and even annual reports of fraud.
During the period from June 11th to 15th, the reporter of the Yangtze River Business Daily visited two projects in Guangzhou, which were sold by Yuetai, and found that the Jiasheng Building of Jiasheng Project on the Younan Second Street of Yuexiu District remained In the construction of the construction, it is amazing that the project has been developed for 19 years. The second phase of the Swan Bay project on Taigucang Road in Haizhu District has been basically completed. There is no specific opening time, and the completion time of the project is three years later than expected.
It is worth mentioning that Yuetai shares mentioned in the 2018 annual report that the annual contracted area of ​​the Rongting House project of Guangzhou Company was 4381.16 square meters, the contracted turnover was 293 million yuan, and the annual sales income was 179 million yuan.
However, the reporter from the Changjiang Commercial Daily visited the Rongting House project in Donghua West Road, Yuexiu District. The sales staff said that the project had not been opened for sale because of the dispute over the development of the company. The reporter landed on the official website of the Guangzhou Municipal Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau, Sunshine Jiayuan, and did not inquire about the pre-sale certificate information of the project.
Then, in the absence of opening sales, and no pre-sales information, how did the Rongting government project record nearly 300 million yuan in turnover?
In response to the development and sales of the above projects, the reporter of Changjiang Commercial Daily contacted the secret office of Yuetai Co., Ltd. to conduct an interview and verify the evidence. The staff asked the reporter to send a letter to the e-mail box, saying that the relevant responsible person would check and respond as soon as possible, but as of press time, Did not receive the other party's reply.
Guangzhou two sales projects are slow to develop
On June 9, Yuetai Co., Ltd. announced that it has continuously transferred 5 project equity to Shimao Real Estate for 6.397 billion yuan. Among them, two projects in Guangzhou include Jiasheng Construction Project and Swan Bay Phase II Construction Project .
The announcement shows that the Guangzhou Jiasheng construction project is to promote the name of “Jiasheng Building”. The planned building layer is 51 floors above ground and 4 floors underground. As of May 22, 2019, the project has completed the basement of the above-ground tower. Layer and 36-story structure construction.
On the morning of June 11, Changjiang Business Daily reporter went to Jiasheng Building and saw that the project had begun to take shape. Most of the facades were still cement walls, and a small number of walls were painted with blue paint. The staff said that Jia Sheng Building is still under construction, and the reporter also heard the mechanical cutting sound at the scene.
According to the disclosure of Yuetai Co., the Guangzhou Jiasheng project started in November 2000. The foundation pit excavation was completed in 2001. It was originally planned to receive the pre-sale certificate at the end of 2001 and early 2002. However, due to disputes with the partners, the construction of the project has been in existence for many years. The stagnation was resumed until December 2012, when the expected completion time was June 2015. Subsequently, the project's completion time was adjusted several times.
Recently, the reporter of Changjiang Commercial Daily saw the construction nameplate of the Jiasheng Building Commercial and Residential Building Project on the project wall. The completion date of the project was June 2018. In the 2018 annual report, Yuetai Co., Ltd. stated that the completion time of Jiasheng Building was December 2020.
At the same time, the temporary reception center of Jiasheng Building is opening the door at the South Second Street of Siyou Xinma Road, about 100 meters away from the project. However, the sales staff said that there is no opening sale. At the same time, it said that according to the plan, the project will launch a large-sized apartment of 130 square meters to 214 square meters. The current price has not yet been determined, but it is expec"

Failure to raise sufficient funds to repay bank loans. As of the disclosure date, the amount of the credit loan business signed by Guangzhou Xucheng and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Xihua Road Sub-branch under the real estate loan contract was overdue, and the overdue amount was approximately 256 million yuan.
Recently, Changjiang Business Daily reporter visited the Guangzhou Rongqing Phase II real estate project and saw that the project was promoted as “Yuetai Rongting House”. Although it has been completed, according to sales personnel, it has not been sold to date. At the same time, on June 15th, the reporter landed on Sunshine Jiayuan, the website of Guangzhou City Housing and Urban-Rural Development Bureau, and did not inquire about the pre-sale certificate information of the project.
What is puzzling is that in the 2018 annual report, Yuetai shares said that the annual contracted area of ​​the Rongting government project of Guangzhou Company was 4381.16 square meters, the contracted turnover was 293 million yuan, and the annual sales income was 179 million yuan. . Nearly 300 million signing turnovers came from, and Yuetai shares were not disclosed. At the same time, the project was not seen in the detailed list of real estate sales. In response to the relevant doubts, the reporter called the letter to the Yuetai shares, as the issue of the other party did not reply.
As of December 31, 2018, Yuetai Co., Ltd. had overdue loans of 2.952 billion yuan. At the same time, as of the end of 2018, Yuetai shares short-term loans of about 3.72 billion yuan, non-current liabilities due within one year as high as 2.973 billion yuan, and by the end of 2018 its hand-held cash was only about 391 million yuan.
The packaged sale of nearly 6.4 billion assets is to ease debt tension. In fact, Yuetai has sold assets several times in recent years. In the two and a half years from 2017 to the present, its total profit through the sale of project equity has exceeded 2 billion yuan."

CORPORATE NEWS
Monday, 25 Mar 2019
Liew: My plan is to firstly turn the company around, and then grow the company in line with our three-year vision plan.""
Liew: My plan is to firstly turn the company around, and then grow the company in line with our three-year vision plan.""
PETALING JAYA: Aturmaju Resources Bhd could be poised to making inroads into the solar panel industry.
Last week, a local media reported that Aturmaju Resources Bhd was poised to acquiring a majority stake in a solar company that had been awarded a 30-year concession by a local university for a 5MW solar panel project.
When queried by Bursa Malaysia, Aturmaju confirmed that it was in negotiations with a relevant party pertaining to a possible acquisition or collaboration with regards to a solar project worth over RM100mil.
The group announced on Bursa last week that the matter is still at the very early stages and that the board had yet to appoint any professionals for the proposal.
“We will make the necessary announcements in time. “Our main focus now is to rebuild and turn around Aturmaju into a profitable company .As you can see, we have recently recorded our first profit in a decade.
“We are aiming to secure more Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) contracts and futher grow the company this year,” said Liew.
Liew would appear to be the company’s new driver, as since his appointment as executive director on Aug 30, the company has secured a few projects.
In addition to that, he has been steadily increasing his stake in the company since emerging with a 4% stake last August.
To date, he has a direct stake of 19% or 191.77 million shares and an indirect stake of 7.3% or 73.55 million shares in the ICPS.
Prior to this, Aturmaju was a Tawau-based wood processing and logging company that has been loss-making for a decade.
In the last quarter of 2018, Aturmaju got Bursa Malaysia’s approval for diversification into the IT business.
Since then, it has announced two IT contracts and has gone back to the black for its financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 -- its strongest set of results in a decade.
Aturmaju registered a net profit of RM4.2mil in FY18, compared to a net loss of RM3.6mil in the previous financial year.
This was mainly attributed to the group’s IT segment, which contributed RM6.9mil or 99% of revenue during the fourth quarter.
Total revenue for FY18 amounted to RM15.3mil, representing a 33% year-on-year increase.
On January 24, Aturmaju finalised its business contract with Yes’s Comm Enterprise Sdn Bhd on a RM20mil ERP contract.
Then, on March 5, it signed a MoU valued at RM78mil with Perkasa Selalu Sdn Bhd to provide smart home engineering system integration, procurement and commissioning of the project.
Liew had been in China for 15 years, but decided to come back to Malaysia for his children’s education purposes.
“While in China, my partners and I set up several businesses in information technology (IT), manufacturing, telecommunication and property development.
“So back in Malaysia, I am pleased to be invited to join Aturmaju to participate in driving the IT business in the company.
“My plan is to firstly turn the company around, and then grow the company in line with our three-year vision plan. I have received valuable assistance from the key team members here. With their help, I am confident our company will grow and we will create value for our shareholders,” said Liew.
Last year, Aturmaju went through a capital reduction, which saw its share capital reduce from RM61.1mil to RM6.72mil.
This exercise gave rise to a credit of approximately RM54.38mil, which was to be utilised to set off the accumulated losses of Aturmaju.
Shareholding changes are also taking place.
This is evident from the disposal of shares by members of the Yeo family, who is the largest shareholder of the company.
Bursa filings over the last few weeks clearly show the Yeo family disposing their shares both via their names and their investment vehicles.
The Yeo family vehicle Affinity Gateway Sdn Bhd also ceased to be a substantial shareholder of the company on March 18 after disposing 1.52 million shares in the company.
Meanwhile, on March 15, Yeo disposed off 118.5 million irredeemable convertible preference shares (ICPS), still leaving him with a 13.46% or 135.71 million shares.
Then, on March 20, filings to Bursa showed that Liew had acquired 18.5 million ICPS via an off market transaction."

May 23, 2018
Multi-level marketing or MLM has become more active on the web as time moves on. The direct sales world experienced major success by allowing others to promote the product. The problem is many MLM businesses are attempting to employ these winning tactics in today’s world without the essential technical support needed to make MLM goals work online as Au Yee Boon points out.
Who is Au Yee Boon?
Au Yee Boon is relatively well-known in circles within the MLM world. He has been actively attempting to create software that would make things easier for MLM organizations when working online.
His company, Techbase Solution, is a popular Malaysian software that provides basic and complex solutions for MLM organizations that are either completely online or are using online tools to reach salespeople as well as potential customers. One thing this company accomplishes is securing a site using state-of-the-art coding, which helps protect the identities of those involved. Of course, these are just some of the solutions his company offers, but there are many more aimed to help MLM organizations get out of their own way.
Au Yee Boon says that “it is frustrating to me when I see a company that would seem to have all of the elements in place to really be successful in marketing or direct sales world,” but these companies continue to get in their own way. Boon mentions that some “are missing out because their software is letting them down.” Sometimes, the problem is that the organization’s owner loves to take on many tasks to reduce costs. This leads them to skip software support or buy something sub part. This can end up hurting an MLM organization in a few ways given enough time.
Things That Au Sees MLM Leaders Overlook
User Experience
One thing that some companies do not pay much attention to is user experience. Online users, customers, and salespeople expect a certain level of fluidity from a site. Not having an easy-to-navigate site or one that does not adapt well to different screens sends the wrong message. It tells visitors that the site is outdated and not tended to. Part of what Techbase Solution offer is a design team that is going to constantly test the site of an MLM organization to ensure optimal user experience.
Platform for Tomorrow’s Currency
There is no doubt about it, most people agree that e-coins are going to become the currency of tomorrow. This world offers many benefits to MLM organizations, especially the ones online. Cryptocurrency opens up many doors. This is one reason Au’s company offers a variety of solutions, modules, and plugins to make e-trading and cryptocurrency exchange just a little easier. MLM organizations should not ignore this change for its own good.
Managed Security
An MLM organization is going to be granting site access to several people, not only customers but direct sales people too. This means the site is going to be holding a lot of personal information, which needs to be protected. The problem is that some companies skim on this and end up putting their visitors in unnecessary danger of identity theft. Part of what Techbase Solution offer is a managed encrypted security system designed for MLM organizations.
Au Yee Boon hopes that more companies do their best to pay attention to their software as much as they pay attention to their business growth plan. Every piece of an MLM is a building block, and one cracked block could jeopardize the entire structure. Seeing things this way can make it easier to understand why something like software and online support is important."

Changjiang Business Daily reporter Yang Lingling Guangzhou report
A few days ago, Yuetai Co., Ltd. (600393.SH) was highly concerned by the market for its 6.4 billion project “Broken Arm Survival”. In fact, the reporters of the Changjiang Commercial Daily found that several real estate projects of Yuetai Co., Ltd. had serious violations of regulations and even annual reports of fraud.
During the period from June 11th to 15th, the reporter of the Yangtze River Business Daily visited two projects in Guangzhou, which were sold by Yuetai, and found that the Jiasheng Building of Jiasheng Project on the Younan Second Street of Yuexiu District remained In the construction of the construction, it is amazing that the project has been developed for 19 years. The second phase of the Swan Bay project on Taigucang Road in Haizhu District has been basically completed. There is no specific opening time, and the completion time of the project is three years later than expected.
It is worth mentioning that Yuetai shares mentioned in the 2018 annual report that the annual contracted area of ​​the Rongting House project of Guangzhou Company was 4381.16 square meters, the contracted turnover was 293 million yuan, and the annual sales income was 179 million yuan.

Most of the facades were still cement walls, and a small number of walls were painted with blue paint. The staff said that Jia Sheng Building is still under construction, and the reporter also heard the mechanical cutting sound at the scene.
According to the disclosure of Yuetai Co., the Guangzhou Jiasheng project started in November 2000. The foundation pit excavation was completed in 2001. It was originally planned to receive the pre-sale certificate at the end of 2001 and early 2002. However, due to disputes with the partners, the construction of the project has been in existence for many years. The stagnation was resumed until December 2012, when the expected completion time was June 2015. Subsequently, the project's completion time was adjusted several times.

The completion date of the project was June 2018. In the 2018 annual report, Yuetai Co., Ltd. stated that the completion time of Jiasheng Building was December 2020."

ARB dakwa tawaran teknologi air dengan dua syarikat China bernilai RM800 juta
TheEdge Tue, 23 Jul, 2019 - 1 jam yang lalu
KUALA LUMPUR (23 Julai): ARB Bhd, yang sebelum ini dikenali sebagai Aturmaju Resources Bhd, bekerjasama dengan dua syarikat berpangkalan di China untuk menyediakan teknologi berkaitan bekalan air dengan nilai projek gabungan sebanyak RM800 juta.
Dalam satu kenyataan hari ini, ARB berkata ARBIOT Sdn Bhd milik penuhnya memeterai memorandum perjanjian (MoA) berasingan dengan Hangzhou Mayam IoT Tech Co Ltd dan Shuifa IoT Tech Co Ltd hari ini.
Di MoA pertama, Hangzhou Mayam akan menyediakan pembiayaan yang diperlukan untuk ARBIOT untuk menggunakan meter air pintar di Malaysia untuk mengukur, mengumpul dan menganalisis maklumat dan data penggunaan air masa nyata, termasuk kebocoran air, tekanan air, tarikh dan masa air yang digunakan oleh isi rumah, dikenali sebagai Projek Metering Water Smart.
Di bawah projek itu, bernilai RM200 juta, ARBIOT bertanggungjawab untuk pemasangan, pengujian dan pentauliahan meter air pintar, manakala Hangzhou Mayam akan memastikan kelulusan yang diperlukan untuk projek itu.
""Kami berharap dapat memanfaatkan pengetahuan teknologi Hangzhou Mayam untuk membantu syarikat / institusi air Malaysia bukan sahaja memahami pola penggunaan air tetapi juga untuk menguruskan kekurangan dan kualiti sumber air dengan lebih berkesan,"" kata Pengarah Eksekutif dan Ketua Pegawai Eksekutif ARB Datuk Larry Liew Kok Leong berkata.
Sementara itu, kerjasama dengan Shuifa melibatkan pemasangan Sistem Penapisan Air Rumah Tangga Pintar yang boleh dibekalkan kepada orang awam dan individu. ARB berkata nilai projek bernilai kira-kira RM600 juta.
Untuk projek ini, ARBIOT akan bertanggungjawab untuk menyediakan ujian, pentauliahan, sokongan selepas jualan, pembaikan dan penyelenggaraan sistem, manakala Shuifa juga akan mendapatkan kelulusan yang diperlukan untuk sistem tersebut.
""Apa yang kami harapkan untuk menyediakan penduduk adalah meningkatkan kualiti air, bergerak dari pencegahan kepada penyenggaraan peranti ramalan (menggunakan data seperti aliran air, tekanan, suhu, dan kekonduksian), serta pengalaman pengguna yang unik - di mana mereka boleh menggunakan peranti mudah alih untuk mengawal suhu air apabila diperlukan, ""kata Liew.
Beliau berkata ARB menyasarkan untuk memasang sistem penapisan air isi rumah pintar di 300,000 unit kediaman di Malaysia. ""Pemaju semakin bersedia untuk memanjakan dan menarik pembeli dalam pasaran hartanah yang lembut, dan kami percaya sistem penapisan air itu akan menjadi titik jualan yang unik untuk projek-projek itu,"" tambah Liew.
Saham ARB hari ini ditutup 0.5 sen atau 1.15% pada 44 sen dengan permodalan pasaran sebanyak RM67.6 juta.

A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), also known as a memorandum of understanding, is a formal business document used to outline an agreement made between two separate entities, groups or individuals. A MOA usually precedes a more detailed contract or agreement between the parties. This MOA may be used to cooperatively work together on an agreed upon purpose or meet an agreed objective and outline the discussed terms of a new relationship. The purpose of an MOA is to have a written understanding of the agreement between the parties. A MOA usually precedes a more detailed contract or agreement, after a process of negotiations and due diligence. This MOA provides a simple but effective format to enter into a general agreement prior to finalizing a more detailed contract or agreement with a party."

""tang tang是的，au在6月17号的时候有announced待有8万lot arbb的母股，母股待有总合比例在六月的时候是6.29%，而在这个月尾因为有大量的pa转换去母股，今天母股量已经达到161.3m share了，而au手上还是待有着那个8万lot arbb 的母股，只是在今天后他的待有比例因为母股量增加多，导致他待股比例下降至4.96%，触动到bursa规定的5%以下或以上都必须通告咯，从今天的通告来看，au还是继续待有着那8万lot，代表这几天大量pa的转换去母股不是他，那到底又是谁那么大量的pa转换去母股呢！
还有点大家可以注意，在六月通告里有说明au待有pa 的direct 19%和indirect 11%总合是待有30%，而在今天通告里让我们看到au还是待有着那8万lot母股，并沒有增加或减少，而他待有pa 30%只要在open market一卖，立刻大家就会在announcement看到他卖pa。""

ARB Bhd’s diversification from the timber business into information technology (IT)-related services has been gaining traction and is a boon to its earnings.
Formerly known as Aturmaju Resources Bhd, ARB has rebranded itself from a little-known Sabah timber firm to a technology solutions provider and returned to the black, with a record quarterly net profit of RM5.08 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 (1Q19), compared to a net loss of RM649,000 it posted a year prior.
1Q19 also saw ARB’s revenue surged to its highest since 2015 at RM12.43 million from RM79,000 a year ago.
The 1Q19 revenue was close to the RM15.23 million the group achieved for the entire financial year 2018 (FY18).
ARB was initially involved in the manufacturing of various types of woods, software development, contract logging, leasing scows and tugboats, provision of management services and investment holding.
Today, in an effort to survive in a tough environment, ARB has diversified into IT solutions, developing enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to cater for small and medium enterprises and manufacturing business operations in Malaysia.
Most recently, the firm through its wholly owned Arbiot Sdn Bhd has announced its collaboration with two Chinese companies for the provision of water supply-related technology, with a combined project value of RM800 million.
Arbiot signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Hangzhou Mayam IoT Tech Co Ltd to deploy smart metres to measure, collect and analyse water consumption information — with the project valued at RM200 million.
The corporate announcement has pushed ARB’s shares 2.3% higher to 45 sen from 44 sen on Tuesday. Trading volume doubled the average for this time of day and almost tripled the 20-day average.
Prior to this, the company bagged two new Internet of Things (IoT) system and engineering, procurement, commissioning and management (SEPCM) contracts worth RM18 million and RM60.4 million each, which analysts believe will generate higher earnings for ARB.
In addition, ARB has acquired a re-energy business for a green project for a 30-year concession period to perform the installation, operation and management of the solar photovoltaic (PV) system, which is likely to generate decent cashflow for ARB going forward.
The group has also entered into an MoU with Chean Chhoeng Thai Group Co Ltd (CCTG) to provide the IoT and IT services to CCTG’s mixed-development project in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.
The agreement marked ARB’s maiden foray into Cambodia, and the IoT and IT project value for Arbiot is about US$100 million (RM412 million).
Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd (HLIB) in a note recently stated that following the profitable FY18 and two consecutive quarters of strong earnings, ARB’s IT-related services and ERP solutions are likely to bring record earnings.
New management at ARB has managed to secure projects worth RM260 million year-to-date.
HLIB reckons the company is growing aggressively and earnings visibility may sustain for the next one to two years.
“With the expansion in the IoT segment, they have been awarded two contracts. On May 29, ARB was awarded an RM18 million contract to undertake the IoT SEPCM project for a year.
“Another IoT SEPCM contract worth RM60.4 million has also been awarded to ARB to be completed within the next 18 months. We view this as a positive catalyst for the already turnaround company in FY19,” it said.
In May, ARB acquired a 51% stake of C&M Renewable Technology Sdn Bhd and the acquisition will open up the re-energy solution segment. The company’s roles are to provide technology equipment and assets, and perform installation, operation and management of the solar PV system, according to HLIB.
Over the past one year, ARB has advanced 125% and in the last 30 days, it rose 4.7%. The current market capitalisation of ARB stands at RM68.35 million."

华夏时报 07-26
近日，《华夏时报》记者通过查询人民法院公告网发现，自2019年以来，全国有274家房企发布了破产公告。此外，破产房企大多是一些中小房企。但不得不提的是，2019年6月，A股上市的房企银亿集团因资金链断裂宣告破产重组，宁波首富就此跌入谷底。七月流火，中小房企步入资本寒冬。
多渠道融资收紧 中小房企四处筹钱
易居研究院智库中心研究总监严跃进对《华夏时报》记者说：“类似破产数据本质上也说明了当前房企的一个困境，即在融资环境收紧的情况下，房企的资金面会更加恶化，进而给相关房企带来较大的影响。”
从去年下半年开始，房企的融资环境较为宽松，放松的趋势也比较明显。但2019年5月份则成为了房企融资的分界点，融资环境明显缩紧。根据同策研究院监测的数据显示，2019年5月，40家典型上市房企共计完成融资总额367.99亿元，相比较4月份，融资总额大幅下跌了52.07%。
此外，公司债和其他债权的融资渠道也在同步收紧。数据显示，5月份仅发行了6笔公司债，相比较4月份则下降了近8成。国内融资不畅，房企将融资目光转向国外。根据同策资管发布的数据显示，6月份，外币融资总额高达224.62亿元，环比5月则大幅上涨588%。境外融资“力挽狂澜”，贡献了不少亮眼的成绩。40家典型房企在6月份完成了611.6亿元的融资，重新推进加杠杆。就2019年上半年来看，40家典型房企完成融资金额近4200亿元，部分大型房企上半年的融资额高达400亿元。
海外融资刚刚开始发力，便被立刻收紧。7月12日，国家发展改革委发布了《国家发展改革委办公厅关于对房地产企业发行外债申请备案登记有关要求的通知》。文件第1条指出，房地产行业发行外债只能用于置换未来一年内到期的中长期境外债务。政策一出，房企海外融资受限。
与此同时，房企信托开始降温，监管升级。银保监会方面表示，为加强房地产信托领域风险防控，针对近期部分房地产信托业务增速过快、增量过大的信托公司，银保监会进行了约谈警示。信托业务全面收紧，房企的各类融资渠道形势则不容乐观。
卖项目求生 IPO之路难走
融资收紧，房企进入“缺钱”和“还债”的两难之地。头部或大型房企尚有承担高负债风险的能力，而在融资收紧的背景下，中小房企因风险承受力较差，负债承压。融资无门，不少房企选择卖项目或转让股权求生。6月26日，粤泰股份（600393.SH）发布公告称，公司已经通过了关于广州嘉盛项目在建工程转让的议案以及关于广州天鹅湾二期项目在建工程转让的议案。粤泰股份将旗下两大项目转让给世茂，试图缓解流动性之急。据悉，粤泰股份共有24个账户被冻结，被冻结账户余额约为7165万元，而账面价值46.48亿元的开放项目等也被查封。
严跃进对《华夏时报》记者说：“部分房企的压力增大，自然会选择用收购并购等方式对项目进行处置。”上市房企生存尚且如此艰难，中小房企也不得不进入这场“大鱼吃小鱼”的游戏中。7月18日，河南省中原产权交易有限公司挂出了一则挂出了一则股权转让公告。资料显示，内黄鼎晨置业有限公司拟转让70%的股权和4670.63万元的债权。该公司属于国有挂牌项目，其2018年年度审计报告显示，其2018年度营业收入为0，利润总额为-42.6万元。同一天，该公司发布另一则转让信息，继续转让剩余30%的股权。
卖项目和转让股权的中小房企不在少数，其大多数由大型房企接盘。中小房企的另一条寒冬求生之路是上市。2018年，赴港上市的房企、物业管理公司有十余家，其中包括恒达集团（HK3616）、大发地产（HK6111）等。房企千亿时代到来，行业两极分化严重，中小房企的生存空间被日益压缩，上市融资成为了“活下去”的重要路径。
然而，赴港IPO之路也不如去年顺利。在宏观环境的监控下，赴港上市速度降低，融资收紧“逼迫”上市审核趋向严格，中小房企拿到上市门票的难度加大。自去年中小房企扎堆上市之后，今年中小房企赴港IPO的热度降低。自2019年1月以来，共有8家房企和2家物业管理公司赴港上市。按照港交所主板上市规则，递交招股书6个月之后，如果不能顺利上市则会显示“失效”。值得注意的是，有4家房企曾在提交上市材料之后显示“失效”，上市之路多有坎坷。
中小房企如何取暖？专家：房企应学会弯道超车
融资收紧，赴港IPO解不了近渴，中小房企资金不足。与此同时，全国各地楼市政策日趋严格，“稳”成为当前楼市的主旋律。严跃进对《华夏时报》记者说：“中小企业破产本身和房屋销售不好、拿地机会不多等都有关系。限购、限售等政策最终也会对部分中小房企形成限制和制约。”
在寒冬来临之际，中小房企该如何取暖？“中小房企破产依然是需要被认定为个案。实际上，随着后续经济刺激等力度的强化，部分竞争力强的房企包括中小房企，其实还是有机会崛起的。部分房企要不卑不亢和学会弯道超车，比如很多三四线城市的规划依然不错，会带来许多新的市场发展机会，中小房企仍可以在新一轮的竞争中实现较好的发展。”严跃进对《华夏时报》记者说。
严跃进认为，未来中小房企对待此类的行业变化，一方面要主动转型，做一些轻资产业务。另一方面，中小房企也要积极研究细分的产业链模式。
此外，严跃进认为，破产是行业下行压力和房企经营压力双重因素下的结果，预计后续部分没有太多土地储备、缺乏高周转能力的地产企业还是会面临破产风险，尤其是中小房企。严跃进提醒购房者，购房时需要警惕项目是否竣工和达到交付标准，还需要防范开发商随意把项目做抵押或抵债。"

Under maximum scenario assuming full conversion will be share cap 1b x 50c =500m market cap. But it will also generate 190m cash. So if i ex it out will be around 300m market cap. Pe 15x. But i see they got upcoming more than 1b projects that will come on board next year with earnings recognition, which i think earnings can easily doubled to 40m. Then the pe is still 7.5x
Can i calculate like that, all the sifus?"

Aug 01, 2019
Recognia has detected a ""Bottom Triangle"" chart pattern formed on ARB Bhd (7181:MYX). This bullish signal indicates that the stock price may rise from the close of 0.470 to the range of 0.740 - 0.800. The pattern formed over 76 days which is roughly the period of time in which the target price range may be achieved, according to standard principles of technical analysis.
Tells Me: The price seems to have reached a bottom, showing signs of reversal as it has broken upward after a period of uncertainty or consolidation. A Bottom Triangle shows two converging trendlines as prices reach lower highs and higher lows. Volume diminishes as the price swings back and forth between an increasingly narrow range reflecting uncertainty in the market direction. Then well before the triangle reaches its apex, the price breaks above the upper trendline with a noticeable increase in volume, confirming this bullish pattern as a reversal of the prior downtrend.
This bullish pattern can be seen on the following chart and was detected by Trading Central proprietary pattern recognition technology"

contract #1
contract value = 18m

This counter should've stayed above 0.5 from May onwards, but the operators wanted to be a bunch of smart assses, only to get bitten in their own asses.
I'm very fortunate my current loss is just a few hundred ringgits compared to the thousands I gained earlier from this counter. For the time being, I have no confidence at all with the top people in ARBB."

康达尔：华超投资更名“京基时代 ” 且放弃表决权已生效
9月20日，深圳市康达尔（集团）股份有限公司发布关于股东股权变更重大事项的进展公告。
公告披露，早在此前9月16日康达尔布公告称，公司于9月12日接到控股股东京基集团有限公司通知，京基集团与深圳市华超投资控股集团有限公司股东罗爱华、陆伟民已办理完成受让华超投资51%股权的工商变更登记事宜。
股权完成变更后，深圳市华超投资控股集团有限公司更名为深圳市京基时代实业有限公司并领取新的营业执照。同时，京基时代法定代表人变更为刘辉，京基集团、陆伟民、罗爱华持股比例分比为51%、19.6%、29.4%。
此外，根据股权转让协议，华超投资在规定期间内放弃其所持有的康达尔全部11,664.18万股，占已发行股份的29.85%。
根据此次最新公告披露，9月19日，康达尔接到控股股东京基集团通知，深圳市京基时代实业有限公司（原名为深圳市华超投资控股集团有限公司）自2019年9月19日起放弃其所持有的康达尔全部116,641,816股股份（占公司已发行股份的29.85%）除收益权以外的其他全部股东权利，即放弃表决权。

9月20日，五洲国际控股有限公司发布特别调查委员会最新进展。
观点地产新媒体查阅公告显示，五洲国际独立重组顾问已就疑属未经批准转让向特别调查委员会提供一份初步草拟报告。特别调查委员会已举行会议讨论有关初步报告，并已议决展开下列跟进措施：

There are no 100% guarantee in return. If cannot take the risk, can invest in Fixed Deposit, their return is guarantee. Just my personal point of view."

market cap = 73m
6M profits = 13m
assuming balance 2 quarters profits to be conservatively 10m, full year profits at 23m
73m/23m = 3.17x
Ok then our chris khoo (if he follows until here) will ask about the fully dillutive. ok fine.
pa outstanding = 841m
current share issued 234m + 841m x 0.31 = 333m market cap - cash 160m = 173m / 23m = 7.5x

Let me as an auditor (shit i disclose my identity) tell u, when we signed off the name, our credibility and license are liable to the report. before we do that, we have to cross checked and do our due diligence to make sure the source of the income and expenses are correct as reported by the company. of course, this process will not be made public to chris khoo.

GMV is the estimated sales value of the ERP platform. equal to revenue to be recognised ARBB?
i am wondering myself, what did i do wrong that i need to spend time explaning to kid @ chris.
GMV is gross merchandise value. if u r willing to spend a bit of time to read the interviews that dato has conducted before, u will realise under this structure, GMV is = or higher for the revenue recognition. Look at the announcement on TATAN, it says 'not less than'. when u say not less than, it means cannot less than, in other words, it means tak boleh kurang daripada, 不能少过. so it means...minimum revenue recognition is 20m USD for tatan contract. do u get it now mt friend?"

Is there a life after death?
This question is misworded because life doesn't died.
The question should be what died and what lives?
More fundamentally, what is life?
The body (made of clay) died and life went to where? It can't just disappeared..they said go up or go down (hell). In term of space, there is no up or down.
In order to understand what happens when life leaves, we have appreciate what happens when life comes...what does is mean when somebody is born?
When God created the human being, he fashioned a body and breathed into it a living Soul.."

MoU's with Shuifa and Mayam for installation of smart water filter and smart water meter!!! during signing, it was made known in final stage of negotiation, but until now no news!!!!
In Sep Selangor has oredi given the smart meter pilot test to GKENT.....
http://www.bernama.com/en/news.php?id=1749597
Other developments:
(1) Ex Executive Director resigned on 26/6, just a few days after he became substantial holder on 14/6!!!
(2) While major business i.e. ERP/IOTSEPCM are located in Peninsular and ARBB office in Sentral, why on 6/8 corporate office address again change to Tawau?
So in subtance, what ARBB left? TTDI Sentralise (common director for psiptek) and Tatan, what ARBB have?
Many of the above discussed are unrealised business cores....unrealised therefore not recorded in book, so nothing related audited report!!!! lol...audited report (reasonable assurance not absolute assurance on financial statement) can be perfectedly alright but stock price may still go to 1s?....
Some would say P/E of this BB is attractive....is P/E your only consideration in stock selection? what about future value? quality of assets/project, consistency of management decision and etc?
[jacksonwong said he is an auditor and not agreed with all above statements, unfortunately jacksonwong unable to provide verifiable MIA no to verify his auditor identity...lol]

[kennychua, therainmaker, elainetan, jacksonwong, danienlheng, christineberry - just check their comment history...then you know they are probably proxies to someone...all accounts started recently and only comment on ARBB asking people to buy more :)]
[and when you are persistence enough to share the facts williamchan82 would post implied questions of dead vs alive!! an indirect open threatening for termination?..]"

from the announcements in past, do you agree with following points:
(1) C&M acquisition announcement yet to mention when the solar to be kick off? It was not kick off in Q2....will it kick off in Q3?....my opinion is not!!!!
(2) the IOTSEPCM for shah alam with psiptek!!! is it a rescue of psiptek which is short of cash? it is = contract given to psiptek for stellar residence? if psiptek is ori contractor, past record psiptek construction margin good? even if established co i.e. kerjaya only recorded gross profit margin of 20%, is psiptek only record about 10%?...if yes, when it sub to arbb, will the margin even lower?
(3) referring to (2), Q2 ERP margin was about 55%? with erp revenue of about 11mio?..will the ERP revenue able to maintain with Tatan?
(4) Will the iotsepcm dragged down the gross profit to a very large extend?
(5) ARBB is old baby, psiptek is new baby, boss to give priority to which one when his resources are limited? the stellar residences construction gp, will it be allocated to ARBB or psiptek?

__________________________________________________________________
A: Please see 6 may 2019 announcement pg 1. the project was awarded to CMSB on 20 Nov 2018. and now ARB acquired 51% in CMSB. this effectively means, the project is ongoing, and if u have some minor common sense left with u, u will know the duration to install solar panels for this scale will take at least 6 months to 1 year, depending on the progress of the financing, EPCC etc. that's totally normal for no recognition in Q2, i dont even think Q3 we will see any recognition. Perhaps this will be FY2020 earnings recognition. But just cash flow of around RM5m/year, not significant at all.
so your argument is that there was no mention of when the solar project will kick off. this is effectively asking how come a man is a guy and not a girl. i dont know how who and how to answer ur question.
________________________________________________________________________
(2) the IOTSEPCM for shah alam with psiptek!!! is it a rescue of psiptek which is short of cash? it is = contract given to psiptek for stellar residence? if psiptek is ori contractor, past record psiptek construction margin good? even if established co i.e. kerjaya only recorded gross profit margin of 20%, is psiptek only record about 10%?...if yes, when it sub to arbb, will the margin even lower?
__________________________________________________________________________
A: rescue of prinsiptek which is short of cash? so r u saying all companies that involved in the related party transaction are short of cash? In the business world, i sub a job to u, i want to rescue u, cannot ah? is it illegal? as long as u provide me the service, u complete the job, what is the problem with it? i dont get it brother chris.
u talk about margin. even margin lower than 10%, so? did u see what is the margin of bina puri? so getting a job which is low margin also wrong? at least it is not a loss making project. i think u need to spend some of ur time, talk to the people in the construction industry. even if u chris doesnt need to eat, they need to feed their families. some even take on projects with no margin, just to get the cash rolling. and now u r complaining margin of 10% is too low, wa chris ur world is so nice eh. r u from another universe?
__________________________________________________________________________
(3) referring to (2), Q2 ERP margin was about 55%? with erp revenue of about 11mio?..will the ERP revenue able to maintain with Tatan?

A: the way i look at ur question, u r trying to forecast ARBB's earnings? hey bro this is wrong ok, that means u r trying to mislead the investors, i can file a complain with bursa malaysia.
but just to entertain ur question - if u ever check back all the interviews conducted by Dato larry liew, u will realise the 55% margin is not sustainable, as it involves one-off sell of ERP system which is high margins. he mentioned that in coming quarters, with the recurring business model like yess and tatan, the margins will be lower, but to offset that, it will be recurring income on a yearly basis.
so i dont get ur question. What do u meant that Tatan revenue will be able to maintain the 11m? Use ur eyes, see clearly. it's 84m/year. u divide into per quarter will be how much? do u need to go back to the math class?_______________________________________________________________________
(4) Will the iotsepcm dragged down the gross profit to a very large extend?
______________________________________________________________________
A: how to drag the gp into a very large extend? see the announcement, please read it and read it and while u think u have finished reading, read AGAIN!!! this is to avoid people treat u like a kid, asking stupid questions.
ARBB's role in the project involves SEPCM. and they involved in the beginning of the project, from the consultation. all these will generate profits for arbb.

2 OUT OF 3 IOTSEPCMs are not cash generating
(1) IOTSEPCM located at Kuala Selangor, signed with Perkasa Selalu S/B (about 60million), high rise condominium, location near to McDonald. No building plan approved by OSC since December 2018, therefore, being question by Bursa!!! They said needs 4 years!!!!
Perkasa Selalu's director Chin family (Chin and Liew are now directors of psiptek)
OSC - http://www.epbt.gov.my/osc/Borang_info.cfm?ID=256810&NoForm=Form3
Google - https://www.google.com/maps/@3.3285898,101.2580743,743m/data=!3m1!1e3
(2) IOTSEPCM located at Tronoh next to Universiti Petronas, signed with IJ Ventures S/B (about 20million), terrace, oversupply surrounding area, very high % of untenanted units, yet the plot with uneven terrain!!! high earthwork cost?
IJ Venture's director Chin family (Chin and Liew are now directors of psiptek)
OSC - http://www.epbt.gov.my/osc/Borang_info.cfm?ID=363681&NoForm=Form1

MoU's at Cambodia
(1) 1 general insurance ERP, 1 life insurance ERP, 1 riverside development, all these are related to Yuetai group!!!...a china listed company facing cash flow issued and shares being frozen twice recently!!! and their boss being querry by China's authority!!!
Even if contract is given....you dare to buy? when going to turn bad debt?
http://stock.jrj.com.cn/2019/09/24062928170198.shtml
https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/observe/2019-09-20/doc-iicezueu72206...
(2) Tatan group ERP!!! - disclosed GMV value but estimated revenue to be booked unknown!!! GMV = revenue? no? revenue can be much lower? early 2019 also announced and ERP with Yess Communication Enterprice (not YTL's YES) with GMV!!! GMV is the estimated sales value of the ERP platform. equal to revenue to be recognised ARBB?
MoU's with Shuifa and Mayam for installation of smart water filter and smart water meter!!! during signing, it was made known in final stage of negotiation, but until now no news!!!!
In Sep Selangor has oredi given the smart meter pilot test to GKENT.....
http://www.bernama.com/en/news.php?id=1749597
Other developments:
(1) Ex Executive Director resigned on 26/6, just a few days after he became substantial holder on 14/6!!!
(2) While major business i.e. ERP/IOTSEPCM are located in Peninsular and ARBB office in Sentral, why on 6/8 corporate office address again change to Tawau?
So in subtance, what ARBB left? TTDI Sentralise (common director for psiptek) and Tatan, what ARBB have?
Many of the above discussed are unrealised business cores....unrealised therefore not recorded in book, so nothing related audited report!!!! lol...audited report (reasonable assurance not absolute assurance on financial statement) can be perfectedly alright but stock price may still go to 1s?....
Some would say P/E of this BB is attractive....is P/E your only consideration in stock selection? what about future value? quality of assets/project, consistency of management decision and etc?
[jacksonwong said he is an auditor and not agreed with all above statements, unfortunately jacksonwong unable to provide verifiable MIA no to verify his auditor identity...lol]
[therainmaker is a fake accounts for trapping purpose..started sep only for ARBB

2 OUT OF 3 IOTSEPCMs are not cash generating
(1) IOTSEPCM located at Kuala Selangor, signed with Perkasa Selalu S/B (about 60million), high rise condominium, location near to McDonald. No building plan approved by OSC since December 2018, therefore, being question by Bursa!!! They said needs 4 years!!!!
Perkasa Selalu's director Chin family (Chin and Liew are now directors of psiptek)
OSC - http://www.epbt.gov.my/osc/Borang_info.cfm?ID=256810&NoForm=Form3
Google - https://www.google.com/maps/@3.3285898,101.2580743,743m/data=!3m1!1e3
(2) IOTSEPCM located at Tronoh next to Universiti Petronas, signed with IJ Ventures S/B (about 20million), terrace, oversupply surrounding area, very high % of untenanted units, yet the plot with uneven terrain!!! high earthwork cost?
IJ Venture's director Chin family (Chin and Liew are now directors of psiptek)
OSC - http://www.epbt.gov.my/osc/Borang_info.cfm?ID=363681&NoForm=Form1
Google - https://www.google.com/maps/@4.3980531,100.9747609,743m/data=!3m1!1e3
MoU's at Cambodia
(1) 1 general insurance ERP, 1 life insurance ERP, 1 riverside development, all these are related to Yuetai group!!!...a china listed company facing cash flow issued and shares being frozen twice recently!!! and their boss being querry by China's authority!!!
Even if contract is given....you dare to buy? when going to turn bad debt?
http://stock.jrj.com.cn/2019/09/24062928170198.shtml
https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/observe/2019-09-20/doc-iicezueu72206...
(2) Tatan group ERP!!! - disclosed GMV value but estimated revenue to be booked unknown!!! GMV = revenue? no? revenue can be much lower? early 2019 also announced and ERP with Yess Communication Enterprice (not YTL's YES) with GMV!!! GMV is the estimated sales value of the ERP platform. equal to revenue to be recognised ARBB?
MoU's with Shuifa and Mayam for installation of smart water filter and smart water meter!!! during signing, it was made known in final stage of negotiation, but until now no news!!!!
In Sep Selangor has oredi given the smart meter pilot test to GKENT.....
http://www.bernama.com/en/news.php?id=1749597
Other developments:
(1) Ex Executive Director resigned on 26/6, just a few days after he became substantial holder on 14/6!!!
(2) While major business i.e. ERP/IOTSEPCM are located in Peninsular and ARBB office in Sentral, why on 6/8 corporate office address again change to Tawau?
So in subtance, what ARBB left? TTDI Sentralise (common director for psiptek) and Tatan, what ARBB have?
Many of the above discussed are unrealised business cores....unrealised therefore not recorded in book, so nothing related audited report!!!! lol...audited report (reasonable assurance not absolute assurance on financial statement) can be perfectedly alright but stock price may still go to 1s?....
Some would say P/E of this BB is attractive....is P/E your only consideration in stock selection? what about future value? quality of assets/project, consistency of management decision and etc?
[jacksonwong said he is an auditor and not agreed with all above statements, unfortunately jacksonwong unable to provide verifiable MIA no to verify his auditor identity...lol]
[therainmaker is a fake accounts for trapping purpose..started sep only for ARBB
go http://www.epbt.gov.my/osc/Carian_Projek.cfm
then select Majlis Daerah Kuala Selangor, then peruse though from page by page search using lot no 15549, you can only find a earthwork plan approval no building plan approval, also go KPKT side http://ehome.kpkt.gov.my/index.php/pages/view/172
you cant find the approve housing project] - IJ venture tronoh site...make a drive the you see the true...yet therainmaker cant show the opposite photos]
[kennychua, therainmaker, elainetan, jacksonwong, danienlheng, christineberry - just check their comment history...then you know they are probably proxies to someone...all accounts started recently and only comment on ARBB asking people to buy more :)]
[and when you are persistence enough to share the facts williamchan82 would post implied questions of dead vs alive!! an indirect open threatening for termination?..]"

2 OUT OF 3 IOTSEPCMs are not cash generating
(1) IOTSEPCM located at Kuala Selangor, signed with Perkasa Selalu S/B (about 60million), high rise condominium, location near to McDonald. No building plan approved by OSC since December 2018, therefore, being question by Bursa!!! They said needs 4 years!!!!
Perkasa Selalu's director Chin family (Chin and Liew are now directors of psiptek)

(2) IOTSEPCM located at Tronoh next to Universiti Petronas, signed with IJ Ventures S/B (about 20million), terrace, oversupply surrounding area, very high % of untenanted units, yet the plot with uneven terrain!!! high earthwork cost?
IJ Venture's director Chin family (Chin and Liew are now directors of psiptek)
OSC - http://www.epbt.gov.my/osc/Borang_info.cfm?ID=363681&NoForm=Form1

MoU's at Cambodia
(1) 1 general insurance ERP, 1 life insurance ERP, 1 riverside development, all these are related to Yuetai group!!!...a china listed company facing cash flow issued and shares being frozen twice recently!!! and their boss being querry by China's authority!!!
Even if contract is given....you dare to buy? when going to turn bad debt?

https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/observe/2019-09-20/doc-iicezueu72206...
(2) Tatan group ERP!!! - disclosed GMV value but estimated revenue to be booked unknown!!! GMV = revenue? no? revenue can be much lower? early 2019 also announced and ERP with Yess Communication Enterprice (not YTL's YES) with GMV!!! GMV is the estimated sales value of the ERP platform. equal to revenue to be recognised ARBB?
MoU's with Shuifa and Mayam for installation of smart water filter and smart water meter!!! during signing, it was made known in final stage of negotiation, but until now no news!!!!
In Sep Selangor has oredi given the smart meter pilot test to GKENT.....
http://www.bernama.com/en/news.php?id=1749597
Other developments:
(1) Ex Executive Director resigned on 26/6, just a few days after he became substantial holder on 14/6!!!
(2) While major business i.e. ERP/IOTSEPCM are located in Peninsular and ARBB office in Sentral, why on 6/8 corporate office address again change to Tawau?
So in subtance, what ARBB left? TTDI Sentralise (common director for psiptek) and Tatan, what ARBB have?
Many of the above discussed are unrealised business cores....unrealised therefore not recorded in book, so nothing related audited report!!!! lol...audited report (reasonable assurance not absolute assurance on financial statement) can be perfectedly alright but stock price may still go to 1s?....
Some would say P/E of this BB is attractive....is P/E your only consideration in stock selection? what about future value? quality of assets/project, consistency of management decision and etc?
[jacksonwong said he is an auditor and not agreed with all above statements, unfortunately jacksonwong unable to provide verifiable MIA no to verify his auditor identity...lol]

2 OUT OF 3 IOTSEPCMs are not cash generating
(1) IOTSEPCM located at Kuala Selangor, signed with Perkasa Selalu S/B (about 60million), high rise condominium, location near to McDonald. No building plan approved by OSC since December 2018, therefore, being question by Bursa!!! They said needs 4 years!!!!
Perkasa Selalu's director Chin family (Chin and Liew are now directors of psiptek)
OSC - http://www.epbt.gov.my/osc/Borang_info.cfm?ID=256810&NoForm=Form3
Google - https://www.google.com/maps/@3.3285898,101.2580743,743m/data=!3m1!1e3
(2) IOTSEPCM located at Tronoh next to Universiti Petronas, signed with IJ Ventures S/B (about 20million), terrace, oversupply surrounding area, very high % of untenanted units, yet the plot with uneven terrain!!! high earthwork cost?
IJ Venture's director Chin family (Chin and Liew are now directors of psiptek)
OSC - http://www.epbt.gov.my/osc/Borang_info.cfm?ID=363681&NoForm=Form1
Google - https://www.google.com/maps/@4.3980531,100.9747609,743m/data=!3m1!1e3
MoU's at Cambodia
(1) 1 general insurance ERP, 1 life insurance ERP, 1 riverside development, all these are related to Yuetai group!!!...a china listed company facing cash flow issued and shares being frozen twice recently!!! and their boss being querry by China's authority!!!
Even if contract is given....you dare to buy? when going to turn bad debt?
http://stock.jrj.com.cn/2019/09/24062928170198.shtml
https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/observe/2019-09-20/doc-iicezueu72206...
(2) Tatan group ERP!!! - disclosed GMV value but estimated revenue to be booked unknown!!! GMV = revenue? no? revenue can be much lower? early 2019 also announced and ERP with Yess Communication Enterprice (not YTL's YES) with GMV!!! GMV is the estimated sales value of the ERP platform. equal to revenue to be recognised ARBB?
MoU's with Shuifa and Mayam for installation of smart water filter and smart water meter!!! during signing, it was made known in final stage of negotiation, but until now no news!!!!
In Sep Selangor has oredi given the smart meter pilot test to GKENT.....
http://www.bernama.com/en/news.php?id=1749597
Other developments:
(1) Ex Executive Director resigned on 26/6, just a few days after he became substantial holder on 14/6!!!
(2) While major business i.e. ERP/IOTSEPCM are located in Peninsular and ARBB office in Sentral, why on 6/8 corporate office address again change to Tawau?
So in subtance, what ARBB left? TTDI Sentralise (common director for psiptek) and Tatan, what ARBB have?
Many of the above discussed are unrealised business cores....unrealised therefore not recorded in book, so nothing related audited report!!!! lol...audited report (reasonable assurance not absolute assurance on financial statement) can be perfectedly alright but stock price may still go to 1s?....
Some would say P/E of this BB is attractive....is P/E your only consideration in stock selection? what about future value? quality of assets/project, consistency of management decision and etc?
[jacksonwong said he is an auditor and not agreed with all above statements, unfortunately jacksonwong unable to provide verifiable MIA no to verify his auditor identity...lol]
[therainmaker is a fake accounts for trapping purpose..started sep only for ARBB
go http://www.epbt.gov.my/osc/Carian_Projek.cfm
then select Majlis Daerah Kuala Selangor, then peruse though from page by page search using lot no 15549, you can only find a earthwork plan approval no building plan approval, also go KPKT side http://ehome.kpkt.gov.my/index.php/pages/view/172
you cant find the approve housing project] - IJ venture tronoh site...make a drive the you see the true...yet therainmaker cant show the opposite photos]
[kennychua, therainmaker, elainetan, jacksonwong, danienlheng, christineberry - just check their comment history...then you know they are probably proxies to someone...all accounts started recently and only comment on ARBB asking people to buy more :)]
[and when you are persistence enough to share the facts williamchan82 would post implied questions of dead vs alive!! an indirect open threatening for termination?..]"

2 OUT OF 3 IOTSEPCMs are not cash generating
(1) IOTSEPCM located at Kuala Selangor, signed with Perkasa Selalu S/B (about 60million), high rise condominium, location near to McDonald. No building plan approved by OSC since December 2018, therefore, being question by Bursa!!! They said needs 4 years!!!!
Perkasa Selalu's director Chin family (Chin and Liew are now directors of psiptek)
OSC - http://www.epbt.gov.my/osc/Borang_info.cfm?ID=256810&NoForm=Form3
Google - https://www.google.com/maps/@3.3285898,101.2580743,743m/data=!3m1!1e3
(2) IOTSEPCM located at Tronoh next to Universiti Petronas, signed with IJ Ventures S/B (about 20million), terrace, oversupply surrounding area, very high % of untenanted units, yet the plot with uneven terrain!!! high earthwork cost?
IJ Venture's director Chin family (Chin and Liew are now directors of psiptek)
OSC - http://www.epbt.gov.my/osc/Borang_info.cfm?ID=363681&NoForm=Form1
Google - https://www.google.com/maps/@4.3980531,100.9747609,743m/data=!3m1!1e3
MoU's at Cambodia
(1) 1 general insurance ERP, 1 life insurance ERP, 1 riverside development, all these are related to Yuetai group!!!...a china listed company facing cash flow issued and shares being frozen twice recently!!! and their boss being querry by China's authority!!!
Even if contract is given....you dare to buy? when going to turn bad debt?
http://stock.jrj.com.cn/2019/09/24062928170198.shtml
https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/observe/2019-09-20/doc-iicezueu72206...
(2) Tatan group ERP!!! - disclosed GMV value but estimated revenue to be booked unknown!!! GMV = revenue? no? revenue can be much lower? early 2019 also announced and ERP with Yess Communication Enterprice (not YTL's YES) with GMV!!! GMV is the estimated sales value of the ERP platform. equal to revenue to be recognised ARBB?
MoU's with Shuifa and Mayam for installation of smart water filter and smart water meter!!! during signing, it was made known in final stage of negotiation, but until now no news!!!!
In Sep Selangor has oredi given the smart meter pilot test to GKENT.....
http://www.bernama.com/en/news.php?id=1749597
Other developments:
(1) Ex Executive Director resigned on 26/6, just a few days after he became substantial holder on 14/6!!!
(2) While major business i.e. ERP/IOTSEPCM are located in Peninsular and ARBB office in Sentral, why on 6/8 corporate office address again change to Tawau?
So in subtance, what ARBB left? TTDI Sentralise (common director for psiptek) and Tatan, what ARBB have?
Many of the above discussed are unrealised business cores....unrealised therefore not recorded in book, so nothing related audited report!!!! lol...audited report (reasonable assurance not absolute assurance on financial statement) can be perfectedly alright but stock price may still go to 1s?....
Some would say P/E of this BB is attractive....is P/E your only consideration in stock selection? what about future value? quality of assets/project, consistency of management decision and etc?
[jacksonwong said he is an auditor and not agreed with all above statements, unfortunately jacksonwong unable to provide verifiable MIA no to verify his auditor identity...lol]
[therainmaker is a fake accounts for trapping purpose..started sep only for ARBB
go http://www.epbt.gov.my/osc/Carian_Projek.cfm
then select Majlis Daerah Kuala Selangor, then peruse though from page by page search using lot no 15549, you can only find a earthwork plan approval no building plan approval, also go KPKT side http://ehome.kpkt.gov.my/index.php/pages/view/172
you cant find the approve housing project] - IJ venture tronoh site...make a drive the you see the true...yet therainmaker cant show the opposite photos]
[kennychua, therainmaker, elainetan, jacksonwong, danienlheng, christineberry - just check their comment history...then you know they are probably proxies to someone...all accounts started recently and only comment on ARBB asking people to buy more :)]
[and when you are persistence enough to share the facts williamchan82 would post implied questions of dead vs alive!! an indirect open threatening for termination?..]"

TRADING IDEA: SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION
COMPLETED, ARBB'S READY TO EMBARK INTO
FRESH UPWARD WAVE - ACCUMULATE!
ARB Berhad operates as a software development company. The
Company offers enterprise resource planning, Internet of things,
and information technology solutions, as well as provides
disposal of timber. ARB serves customers in Malaysia.
Technical view on ARBB:
1. Price action suggested that significant consolidation for ARBB
has completed and it is now ready to embark into new upward
wave;
2.All technical indicators are showing that this stock has reached
its oversold level thus the downside from current level perceived
as limited. As such, direction bias now moves stronger to the
upside as compared to the downside;
3. Anticipate a technical rebound to the first target price at
around RM0.47 before a possible higher drive to around RM0.70
- Accumulate!"

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=85","Oct 23, 2019 4:02 PM","elainetan","therainmaker Dear Friends & Investors,
Many people are afraid to lose money. They want to sleep soundly every night.
So am I. I am just as fearful as everyone else losing money. Therefore, let me recommend you
""PRESENTING ARBB (7181) THE GOOD STOCK FOR INVESTORS""
Why is ARBB (7181) GOOD?
These are my Reasons:
1) ARBB HAS LOW DEBT
Current Liabilities/Non-Current Liabilities
Borrowings -................. - (near to RM15,000 as at 2Q)
If a company has no borrowings or low borrowings can they go bankrupt if you don't owe money to bank, friends or financial institution?
Their cash in the bank is more than enough to cover all their liabilities.
No one or Company can be low in debt, SO ARBB IS A STOCK ON WHICH YOU CAN BUY AND SLEEP SOUNDLY.
2) HIGH NTA
I do not know why so many analysts or retailers start to use NTA as a valuation-base. I used to heard of PER being popularly used, perhaps ... P/B too. But NTA? Why every tom-dick now talking about the NTA of companies when we are trading/investing? Who started the NTA game? The NTA of ARBB is HIGH NTA value ... therefore, it is under-valued.
Price/NTA = 106.1%
*The closing share price taken is at end June.
So WHY NOT BUY ARBB? GO AHEAD.
To me, I’m all in ready for the spike!
Thanks rainmaker for your analysis. Indeed this co is still new and undervalue, growing company is normally a buy call. With the government support in the future IT development in Malaysia, IT stocks should go up. Giving it sometime and support for this co."

2 OUT OF 3 IOTSEPCMs are not cash generating
(1) IOTSEPCM located at Kuala Selangor, signed with Perkasa Selalu S/B (about 60million), high rise condominium, location near to McDonald. No building plan approved by OSC since December 2018, therefore, being question by Bursa!!! They said needs 4 years!!!!
Perkasa Selalu's director Chin family (Chin and Liew are now directors of psiptek)
OSC - http://www.epbt.gov.my/osc/Borang_info.cfm?ID=256810&NoForm=Form3
Google - https://www.google.com/maps/@3.3285898,101.2580743,743m/data=!3m1!1e3
(2) IOTSEPCM located at Tronoh next to Universiti Petronas, signed with IJ Ventures S/B (about 20million), terrace, oversupply surrounding area, very high % of untenanted units, yet the plot with uneven terrain!!! high earthwork cost?
IJ Venture's director Chin family (Chin and Liew are now directors of psiptek)
OSC - http://www.epbt.gov.my/osc/Borang_info.cfm?ID=363681&NoForm=Form1
Google - https://www.google.com/maps/@4.3980531,100.9747609,743m/data=!3m1!1e3
MoU's at Cambodia
(1) 1 general insurance ERP, 1 life insurance ERP, 1 riverside development, all these are related to Yuetai group!!!...a china listed company facing cash flow issued and shares being frozen twice recently!!! and their boss being querry by China's authority!!!
Even if contract is given....you dare to buy? when going to turn bad debt?
http://stock.jrj.com.cn/2019/09/24062928170198.shtml
https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/observe/2019-09-20/doc-iicezueu72206...
(2) Tatan group ERP!!! - disclosed GMV value but estimated revenue to be booked unknown!!! GMV = revenue? no? revenue can be much lower? early 2019 also announced and ERP with Yess Communication Enterprice (not YTL's YES) with GMV!!! GMV is the estimated sales value of the ERP platform. equal to revenue to be recognised ARBB?
MoU's with Shuifa and Mayam for installation of smart water filter and smart water meter!!! during signing, it was made known in final stage of negotiation, but until now no news!!!!
In Sep Selangor has oredi given the smart meter pilot test to GKENT.....
http://www.bernama.com/en/news.php?id=1749597
Other developments:
(1) Ex Executive Director resigned on 26/6, just a few days after he became substantial holder on 14/6!!!
(2) While major business i.e. ERP/IOTSEPCM are located in Peninsular and ARBB office in Sentral, why on 6/8 corporate office address again change to Tawau?
So in subtance, what ARBB left? TTDI Sentralise (common director for psiptek) and Tatan, what ARBB have?
Many of the above discussed are unrealised business cores....unrealised therefore not recorded in book, so nothing related audited report!!!! lol...audited report (reasonable assurance not absolute assurance on financial statement) can be perfectedly alright but stock price may still go to 1s?....
Some would say P/E of this BB is attractive....is P/E your only consideration in stock selection? what about future value? quality of assets/project, consistency of management decision and etc?"

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=85","Oct 24, 2019 4:46 PM","Joseph","Dear Friends & Investors,
Many people are afraid to lose money. They want to sleep soundly every night.
So am I. I am just as fearful as everyone else losing money. Therefore, let me recommend you
""PRESENTING ARBB (7181) THE GOOD STOCK FOR INVESTORS""
Why is ARBB (7181) GOOD?
These are my Reasons:
1) ARBB HAS LOW DEBT
Current Liabilities/Non-Current Liabilities
Borrowings -................. - (near to RM15,000 as at 2Q)
If a company has no borrowings or low borrowings can they go bankrupt if you don't owe money to bank, friends or financial institution?
Their cash in the bank is more than enough to cover all their liabilities.
No one or Company can be low in debt, SO ARBB IS A STOCK ON WHICH YOU CAN BUY AND SLEEP SOUNDLY.
2) HIGH NTA
I do not know why so many analysts or retailers start to use NTA as a valuation-base. I used to heard of PER being popularly used, perhaps ... P/B too. But NTA? Why every tom-dick now talking about the NTA of companies when we are trading/investing? Who started the NTA game? The NTA of ARBB is HIGH NTA value ... therefore, it is under-valued.
Price/NTA = 106.1%
*The closing share price taken is at end June.
So WHY NOT BUY ARBB? GO AHEAD.
To me, I’m all in ready for the spike!
RJ87 rainmaker is correct.
To list a good business. It will take 5 years and alot of ding dong with SC and underwriters.
The fast way getting a company listed is to acquire dying listed business, and use it to buy the profitable business. And report QoQ 4 digit growth. Once the conversion of preference share completes; it will rocket. Can hold for next 2 quarter and if the MOU and Contract materialise and converts to revenue. Else, you are right...it's a con job.
Hi RJ87, thanks for supporting my statement.
It is true that if the business is good, why waste time going through the whole IPO
process which takes a longer route. So why not buying over a company that is not profitable and see how they can diversify their business risk. If you are a businessman. I am sure that you would not want to see your company making losses. That would make you cant sleep every night later.
There are not much of conversion of preference shares left i guess? MOU can turn into MOA/Contract or it might not. I think its up to the company to decide whether they want to work with the other company. I dont think the management is like a 3 year old kid playing sand just signing all the mou's turning into contract. Everyone makes have a choice to make their decision carefully. And it's proven that the company is growing and working on to get more MOA/contracts.Its just that now that they are in the state of MOU.
Just my 2 cents.
:)

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=86","Oct 24, 2019 5:43 PM","RJ87","Chris Khoo,
1)PE 2 IS WHAT HAS MATERIALISED and it is trading undervalue with what it already has and not what yet to come. Learn the difference. If u r the type of idiot that argue, low PE means business prospect is not attractive. I will agree IF there is a drop in EPS from previous and the price drops even faster. In ARBB's case, what drives the PE down to PE 2 is tremendous growth of EPS for last 3 quarters and market has not realize it yet.
2) The RM160mil orderbook is those ALREADY SIGNED. 25% margin = 40mil into retained profit. Current market cap is RM80mil, after adding the profits; you are looking to be market cap of 120mil.
3) I put zero value on their MOU this and that. Total worth of MOU is RM1.46 bil. Conversion 10%, RM146Mil into orderbook will be bonus to existing RM160mil orderbook. I only focused on what's signed and wat's translated into revenue and profit. At the moment, it translated into EPS 5sen. Rolling PE 18sen. Which translate to PE2. If it goes to PE 6, RM1 is not impossible.
4) Some say it's trade receivable. Can't collect money. First, 90 days to 180 days payment term is very common. Quarter to quarter, you can see trade receivable slightly increased in balance sheet and a chunk trade receivable in cash flow statement. Rule of thumb calculating how much money they collected will be (trade receivable,Q1 + increased in trade receivables, Q2) - trade receivable, Q2 = Amount of cash collected. If you are lazy to do the math, let me show you...
(trade receivable,Q1 + increased in trade receivables, Q2) - trade receivable, Q2 = Cash collected.
(RM17.74mil + RM14.48mil) - RM16.5mil = RM15.72mil. ARBB are able to collect their payment.
Like I say, this company was bought over by a tech company to save the listing time and cost. How many people here are aware of this?
Do you u know what's the benefit of buying a company with accumulated loss? Leave it to you guys to think."

ok, do you know there are listed company where the only reason they are there is to just accumulated loss? They hv no debts but they pile up a bunch of accumulated loss.
How many of you people here are aware that...these accounting ""losses"" is actually worth something? Surprisingly, it's sale-able. You would be dumbfounded to hear ""My company accumulated more losses that the other company. So, my company should worth more than that company"".
Next question, do you know that there are some Sdn. Bhd. .... Every year report these revenue dunno come from where; COGS dunno pay to who. Balance sheet in the green. When time is right, the company is sold. Whatttttt forrrrrrr...No joke bro.

Good point 1 :- coming quarter revenue sure up, estimate 25-30million, however, gross profit margin will drop as at least 15million of revenue will come from Stellar Residences sub contract. The rest will be revenue from ERP. Estimate sub contract gross profit max @ 5% ERP can get gp of 45-55%!!
Good point 2:- low debt!!!
Good point 3:- boss is a super smart man!!!
Bad point 1:- ERP contract details are not easy to substantiate (sorry I can further elaborate), moreover risk of recoverability of ERP revenue may getting higher as a big customer is Tatan, Cambodia!!! Sorry to say I have too much suspicious on their ERP business!!
Bad point 2:- no most subtantial contract announcement for months oredi!!!..the sub-con of Stellar Residences from PSIPTEK is not a quality revenue!!!..quality revenue is important!!!....big investor buy future cash flow....no move news on new future cash flow for months
Bad point 3:- as a prudent investor, P/E cannot be calculated solely based on issued mother share...a diluted P/E must be calculated as well...obviously diluted P/E is above 10 and is far too high for current revenue mix of ARBB
Bad point 4:- no focus for the business!!! everything they want to do, from ERP to water filter to water meter to subcon and etc....yet customers are either small or in cambodia or related to problematic yuetai!!!
Bad point 5:- 2018 mother share only 70million, and 2019 june-july around 130million but now 230million? simple form 5 mathematic you know how much maximum the share price can go!!!
Bad point 6:- from book the debt looks low!! but why low? because bank now willing to lent money to them? therefore open up super big PA conversion arbitrage gain? which cost higher?
many other points please explore yourselve"

Nobody is pessimistic or skeptical on ARB stocks now and so next stage will be terminal

It's your money. So, u can sit on the side. The way I see this; the price hasn't moved yet. So, the person pulling this grand scheme isn't profiting anything yet.
If you don't bet on business model; fine. I'm quite confident to bet on their greed.
And he knows what's he is doing. And he WILL PROFIT HIMSELF. All we need to do is follow.
The price hasn't pumped. Nothing to dump. That's the safety net.

Author: HLInvest | Publish date: Wed, 30 Oct 2019, 8:56 AM
In anticipation of another positive 3Q19 results in Nov, ARBB’s prices had rallied 20% to RM0.36 from YTD low of RM0.30. We like ARBB, premised on its emphasis on recurring ERP and solar projects, and its recent venture into IoT business after transforming from a multi-year loss-making timber related business. If executed well, ARBB is expected to yield an impressive growth of 140% earnings CAGR from FY18-20, riding on the YTD jobs secured ~RM250m YTD and numerous MOU and MOA business contracts estimated at ~RM1.4bn in June 2019 with local and overseas clients. Valuations are attractive at 0.8x P/B (vs 1Y avg 0.9x) and 19.2x FY20 FD P/E (vs 1Y avg 3.5x), supported by 5sen net cash/share and 0.11x PEG. The stock is expected to advance further in the short term towards RM0.46 amid the rounding bottom formation and bullish downtrend line breakout.
Business profile: From a multi-year loss-making position with its timber related business, ARB has been diversifying into IT solutions business in 3Q18, mainly involved in the business of IT and software solutions, trading of computer hardware and software, system integration, as well as enterprise resource planning (ERP) development and implementation in Malaysia or worldwide. ERP solutions are enterprise software platforms that electronically capture, store, manage and process information in real time.
Bullish signs ahead amid the rounding bottom formation and downtrend line breakout. After forming a saucer bottom pattern near the YTD RM0.30 recently, ARB finally staged a long awaited downtrend line breakout from RM0.51 (1 Aug) high yesterday. The two positive patterns could potentially kick start a new upswing soon, supported by hook-up in technical indicators. Taking out the immediate resistance at RM0.38 (SMA 200D) would spur prices higher towards RM0.40 (50% FR) next before reaching our LT objective at RM0.46 (76.4% FR). Supports are pegged at RM0.335 (SMA 50D) and RM0.325 (mid BB). Cut loss at RM0.315.
Wow, expecting good results, ARBB has been growing in terms of revenue & profit, seems like a good company with growing prospects."

Author: HLInvest | Publish date: Wed, 30 Oct 2019, 8:56 AM
In anticipation of another positive 3Q19 results in Nov, ARBB’s prices had rallied 20% to RM0.36 from YTD low of RM0.30. We like ARBB, premised on its emphasis on recurring ERP and solar projects, and its recent venture into IoT business after transforming from a multi-year loss-making timber related business. If executed well, ARBB is expected to yield an impressive growth of 140% earnings CAGR from FY18-20, riding on the YTD jobs secured ~RM250m YTD and numerous MOU and MOA business contracts estimated at ~RM1.4bn in June 2019 with local and overseas clients. Valuations are attractive at 0.8x P/B (vs 1Y avg 0.9x) and 19.2x FY20 FD P/E (vs 1Y avg 3.5x), supported by 5sen net cash/share and 0.11x PEG. The stock is expected to advance further in the short term towards RM0.46 amid the rounding bottom formation and bullish downtrend line breakout.
Business profile: From a multi-year loss-making position with its timber related business, ARB has been diversifying into IT solutions business in 3Q18, mainly involved in the business of IT and software solutions, trading of computer hardware and software, system integration, as well as enterprise resource planning (ERP) development and implementation in Malaysia or worldwide. ERP solutions are enterprise software platforms that electronically capture, store, manage and process information in real time.
Bullish signs ahead amid the rounding bottom formation and downtrend line breakout. After forming a saucer bottom pattern near the YTD RM0.30 recently, ARB finally staged a long awaited downtrend line breakout from RM0.51 (1 Aug) high yesterday. The two positive patterns could potentially kick start a new upswing soon, supported by hook-up in technical indicators. Taking out the immediate resistance at RM0.38 (SMA 200D) would spur prices higher towards RM0.40 (50% FR) next before reaching our LT objective at RM0.46 (76.4% FR). Supports are pegged at RM0.335 (SMA 50D) and RM0.325 (mid BB). Cut loss at RM0.315.
Wow, expecting good results, ARBB has been growing in terms of revenue & profit, seems like a good company with growing prospects."

1. Bull market is born in pessimism
2. Bull market grows in skepticism
3. Bull market matures in optimism
4. Bull market dies in euphoria
Nobody is pessimistic or skeptical on IT stocks now and so next stage will be terminal
For bull stock like ARBB it is still in early days
Just emerged from pessimism
Still got skeptical comments?
That is our confirmation that ARBB is chun chun going from skepticism to optimism gradually
Happiest will be this phase as we see prices moving up and going on in uptrend"

净盈利： RM 8.3m YoY 上涨 4359.1% QoQ 下跌3.7%
主要原因：
对比去年同季，ARBB 营业额上涨792.7% 主要贡献于IT业务，约99.7%。这也导致了盈利上涨
对比上季，2019 Q3营业额主要贡献于ARB Development Sdn Bhd 和 ARBBOIT Sdn Bhd
这两间子公司主要是销售 ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) 软件，IOT, 互联网和咨询服务
展望未来：
之前ARBB是经营木有关的业务，在这个季度暂时停止，但会在 Dec 2019重新启动。
对于IT部门，子公司ARB Development Sdn. Bhd. 已经有了合同，同时在2019 Q3 已经开始实行。这合约预计价值约为USD 20m。管理层相信将来会吸引更多有潜能和感兴趣的客户。
EPS ：
以2019 Q3, ARBB的盈利是 RM 8.3m EPS记录了3.54 cents。比起上个季度，ARBB赚取高达 RM 8.6m, 但EPS却记录了6.54 cents。
差不多一样的盈利，但EPS相差那么多。主要原因是太多的""Conversation of Preference Share"" 而导致到EPS 被摊薄了。

KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 4): ARB Bhd reported today a 4,263% spike in net profit at RM8.29 million in its third quarter ended Sept 30,2019 (3QFY19) from RM186,000 a year earlier, helped by a substantial revenue rise on IT-based income.
According to ARB Bhd's Bursa Malaysia filing today, IT-based income rose as the group's timber segment temporarily ceased operations during 3QFY19, ahead of an expected resumption in December 2019. ARB Bhd said total group revenue during the quarter increased to RM33.94 million, from RM3.8 million a year before.
""For the current quarter under review, the group’s revenue increased by 793% compared to preceding year's corresponding quarter. This was mainly due to the IT segment (which) has contributed RM33.852 million or 99.7% of the total revenue and consequently contributed profit for the group,"" ARB Bhd said.
In a separate statement today, ARB Bhd chief executive officer (investment & technology) Datuk Larry Liew Kok Leong said: ""The strong performance is a mix of successful execution of our business strategies and strong organic growth.”
In its Bursa filing, ARB Bhd said its major revenue contributors were wholly-owned subsidiaries ARB Development Sdn Bhd and ARBIOT Sdn Bhd.
""These two subsidiary companies are principally involved in carrying on the business of reselling customised enterprise resource planning (ERP) software system, and Internet of Things, Internet and Multimedia development, and consultancy services,"" ARB Bhd said.
According to ARB Bhd, ARB Development had entered into an approximately US$20 million (about RM83 million) IT contract with an overseas client during 3QFY19 .
For the nine month period (9MFY19), ARB Bhd said cumulative net profit stood at RM21.98 million versus a net loss of RM734,000 a year earlier. Revenue rose to RM57.65 million, from RM8.34 million.
Looking ahead, ARB Bhd said its IT segment is expected to continue contributing the major portion of the company's sales (revenue) and profit. ""The group believes that there would be more potential and interested clients to be engaged (with), in (the) future,"" it added.
At 5pm, ARB Bhd's share price closed up 0.5 sen or 1.35% at 37.5 sen, with some 53 million units traded. ARB Bhd was transacted among Bursa Malaysia's most active stocks."

This stellar result was contributed substantially by the stronger top line of its Information Technology segment, which accounts for 99.7% of its total revenue.
ARB’s 9MFY2019 revenue stood at RM57.6 million, almost 6 times increased as compared to RM8.3 million a year ago.
Describing the commendable financial results, ARB Berhad Chief Executive Officer (Investment & Technology) Dato’ Larry Liew Kok Leong (刘国良) said: “So far 2019 has been a very good year for us, but this quarter has really hit the mark with 43 times increase year-on-year. The strong performance is a mix of successful execution of our business strategies and strong organic growth.”
“ARB’s IT business is in line with two of the hottest buzzwords in real-world technology – Industry Revolution 4.0 (“IR 4.0”) and the Internet of Things (“IoT”). IoT is growing fast and future people’s daily needs going to depend on the Internet. It’s not about connecting computers and smartphones anymore, and we are glad that ARB is in it at the early stage,” Dato’ Larry said.
The prospects of this industry are cemented by the Government of Malaysia through its Budget 2020, whereby the Government is committed to providing support and grants to help businesses achieve automation and digitisation (further enabling access to innovations and disruptive technologies.
“For our another core business – Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”), we believe this is the platform/solution that will be much sought-after in the near future. We see the trend of businesses starting to realise that using ERP systems is highly effective in improving productivity and allowing employees/business owners to operate at a much more efficient level,” Dato’ Larry said.
“Our profit in 3QFY2019 is generated from our recurring-income business model, which I believe has reflected in the last four consecutive quarters. With a market capitalisation of less than RM100 million, our trailing price-to-earnings ratio (“P/E”) stands at less than 4 times, which I strongly believe ARB is undervalued by the investing community, especially for a high-growth IT company,” Dato’ Larry added.
Led by the new and experienced management team as well as resilient growth strategies, the Company is poised to re-brand itself as one of Malaysia’s leading IT solutions provider. In tandem with this new focus, ARB will remain committed to building a sustainable business and maximise shareholders’ value."

In a manufacturing context, this would mean introducing robotics and sensors to replace human labour for tasks that could be automated.The term Industry 4.0 was first publicly introduced in 2011 as “Industrie 4.0” by a group of representatives from different fields (such as business, politics, and academia) under an initiative to enhance the German competitiveness in the manufacturing industry."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=92","Nov 5, 2019 9:44 AM","THEREALDEAL","Malaysia is one of the countries forging ahead with Industry 4.0 (IR4.0). The objective is to modernise our industrial capability, and transform the economy from a low-cost manufacturing country into a high-value competing manufacturer.
Throughout the years, advanced economies have invested heavily in research and development.
According to the Global Innovation Index 2018 by the World Intellectual Property Organisation, all countries within the top 15 ranking were high-income advanced economies.
Germany’s “Industrie 4.0”, first mooted by the government in 2011 via the High-Tech Strategy 2020 Action Plan, focused on transforming its manufacturing sector into a leading advanced cyber physical system provider.
In 2012, the United States adopted the “Smart Manufacturing” strategy policy to utilise networked data and Information & Communication Technologies (ICT) for their manufacturing processes.
Three years later, China introduced its “Made in China 2025” policy to secure its position as a global powerhouse in high-tech industries such as robotics, aviation, and new energy vehicles such as electric and biogas.
Japan is now positioning itself to introduce the next phase of Smart Manufacturing to secure its future manufacturing capabilities and increase digitisation through “Industrial Value Chain Initiative”. According to the EU-Japan Centre, the Japanese Internet of Things (IoT) market is projected to grow to US$126bil by 2020; this is 2.2 times its size in 2015.
In simple terms, the next industrial revolution is taking shape around the globe. Major advanced economies around the world are expecting a significant boost to their manufacturing firms’ competitiveness via IR4.0 methodologies.
Dawn of IR4.0 in Malaysia
For the past 10 years, Malaysia’s manufacturing sector has contributed ~23% to the country’s GDP. To achieve its high income status by 2023, manufacturing remains a core sector of sustainable growth under the 11th Malaysia Plan.
At present, the quick pace of technology advancement is beginning to pave the way for an imminent disruptive wave of IR4.0 in Malaysia.
Many firms attempt to maximise productivity and profitability while being cost-effective by leveraging on disruptive technologies such as IoT, artificial intelligence, automation & robotics, biotechnology, and more.
Not surprisingly, Malaysia is already feeling the effects of disruptive technology, from e-hailing taxi apps such as Grab, to shopping within the comfort of our own home without needing to be physically present at the mall using online shopping apps such as Shopee and Lazada.
In 2016, Malaysian household spending on goods (food and non-alcoholic beverage, clothing and footwear, furnishing and household equipment) fell to 26% of total household spending when compared to 33% in 1994.
Meanwhile, spending on services (health, recreation and culture, education, restaurants and hotels) increased from 20% of household expenditure in 1994 to 22% in 2016. This is clear evidence of the shift in consumption preferences away from goods towards services.
Besides the shift in preference towards services, the proliferation of e-commerce has also altered consumer behaviour. Since e-commerce requires a manufacturing firm with flexible and agile production capacity, the traditional manufacturing model of mass production is slowly losing its significance.
To survive the age of disruption, manufacturers need to adopt a business strategy that can respond quickly to consumer needs and market changes in a cost-effective manner.
Unlike today’s economy that often focuses on generic behavioural competencies, IR4.0 will transform the labour market into a skill-centric type of market, with respect to Information Technology (IT), data analytics, process understanding, and the ability to work with modern interfaces.
Currently, certain jobs do not need these skills. This implies that the core qualifications and skills used in today’s job market are insufficient to revolutionise the manufacturing sector. In short, increased automation will put many low-skilled workers out of job.
In 2016, Foxconn reportedly replaced around 60,000 factory workers with robots, and assigned those workers to tackle higher value-added elements in the manufacturing process.
Lack of standards and technology is another issue that may delay the industrial revolution. According to the Networked Readiness Index by the World Economic Forum, Malaysia ranks 31st out of 139 countries in exploiting the opportunities offered by ICT.
One example is the banking & finance sector, which is in the midst of being transformed or disrupted by digital banks and FinTech companies. In the new era of IR4.0, one shouldn’t be surprised if fintech poses a threat to traditional banking.
In fact, digital transformation is the main reason just over half of the companies on the Fortune 500 have disappeared since 2000."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=92","Nov 5, 2019 9:45 AM","THEREALDEAL","Nevertheless, the level of disruptions, and the risks and opportunities differ across sectors. Essentially, the substance of this revolution lies on the application of available new technologies.
Despite the rapid emergence of IR4.0, there are still many local firms who are unaware that it may transform or replace their existing production methods altogether. In time, technology will transform the overall market structure and revolutionize to more efficient production methods.
This brings us to the main question: is Malaysia fully prepared for IR4.0?
The most recent Malaysia’s National Policy in IR4.0, “Industry Forward” (Industry4WRD) launched on 31 October 2018 by Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir, aims to help transform Malaysia’s manufacturing sector to be stronger and smarter.
This policy is expected to position Malaysia as a strategic partner for smart manufacturing, a primary hub for high-tech industries, as well as total solutions provider for the manufacturing sector in Asia Pacific by 2025.
Industry4WRD is expected to increase the productivity in the manufacturing sector per person by 30% from US$24,486 to US$3,132. This would elevate the absolute contribution of the manufacturing sector to the economy by 54% from US$61bil to US$94bil.
In conjunction with that, there must be a clear overarching policy and coordination by the government to provide an enabling ecosystem for the manufacturing sector to thrive by adopting new technologies, while strengthening on-going structural reforms.
To do this, the government might want to consider providing further assistance to SMEs by measuring their gaps and readiness, and guiding them to adopt IR4.0 technologies.
Despite that, the Malaysian education system should also be imperatively realigned for global recognition and relevance. The formation of Centre of Excellence in polytechnics by Malaysia Technical University Network as an effort to cultivate and improve the quality and multidisciplinary of R&D pertinent to IR4.0 is highly appreciated.
It is also important for private firms to invest in re-skilling and up-skilling their employees, and new entrants into the labour workforce. This is to sharpen the skillset of the workers in tandem to the new operating landscape – consistent with the policy’s target to increase the number of high-skilled workers in the industry from 18% to 35%.
In a nutshell, Malaysia’s future productivity growth is highly dependent on the ability of enablers and adaptors to apply advanced knowledge and technologies associated with the revolution to ensure a sustainable economic growth."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=92","Nov 5, 2019 10:14 AM","THEREALDEAL","Why should investors return in November? There are four core reason to this.
Firstly, we have the traditional window-dressing activities, which tends to see some sort of buying interest among fundamentally beaten down stocks. This happens among stocks which are widely held by institutional shareholders and are significantly lower in value than the start of the year and hence some sort of buying momentum could help fund managers to make their year-to-date performance “much better” and reflect the index’s performance.
Second, we are in the midst of the Q3 reporting season and by the end of November, all companies, especially with the December year-end, would report their bottom line numbers in terms of their performance. While Q3 earnings could dictate market’s reaction, i.e. if the reported profits are either above or below estimate, what typically happens at the end of the Q3 period is the change in broking firm’s valuation matrix.
Analysts would roll-over their fair values of the stocks under their coverage based on the next year’s earnings expectations, i.e. next year’s full year earnings forecast will now come into play instead of the 2019 performance. This typically lifts market’s perception on value as companies that are valued based on one-year forward earnings are likely to be more attractive than current year’s earnings, on the assumption that growth trajectory is still intact or improving.
Third, as we usher in the year 2020, the January effect will come into the picture as investors will start to nimble and re-adjust their portfolio for next year’s market’s theme as well as re-positioning on stocks where some fund managers could have locked-in their gains based on this year’s individual stock’s performance.
Fourth, although this is not a typical strategy but markets tend to have a positive momentum going into the Lunar New Year, which is celebrated as early as Jan 25 next year, just one month after Christmas, and not more than three weeks into the trading cycle of the Gregorian New Year.
Hence, with four positive catalysts helping sentiment, perhaps it’s an opportune time to look at the potential beneficiaries of this momentum.
As far as 2019 is concerned, the KLCI is not a benchmark that had performed well but the overall market sentiment was not too bad. We had very strong winners in 2019 among the IR4.0 companies, DRIVEN BY SENTIMENT AND PROJECT AWARDS. SO WHEN TO BUY ARBB(7181)SHARES? I SAY ITS NOW ! NOW OR NEVER !

According to ARB Bhd's Bursa Malaysia filing today, IT-based income rose as the group's timber segment temporarily ceased operations during 3QFY19, ahead of an expected resumption in December 2019. ARB Bhd said total group revenue during the quarter increased to RM33.94 million, from RM3.8 million a year before.
""For the current quarter under review, the group’s revenue increased by 793% compared to preceding year's corresponding quarter. This was mainly due to the IT segment (which) has contributed RM33.852 million or 99.7% of the total revenue and consequently contributed profit for the group,"" ARB Bhd said.
In a separate statement today, ARB Bhd chief executive officer (investment & technology) Datuk Larry Liew Kok Leong said: ""The strong performance is a mix of successful execution of our business strategies and strong organic growth.”
In its Bursa filing, ARB Bhd said its major revenue contributors were wholly-owned subsidiaries ARB Development Sdn Bhd and ARBIOT Sdn Bhd.
""These two subsidiary companies are principally involved in carrying on the business of reselling customised enterprise resource planning (ERP) software system, and Internet of Things, Internet and Multimedia development, and consultancy services,"" ARB Bhd said.
According to ARB Bhd, ARB Development had entered into an approximately US$20 million (about RM83 million) IT contract with an overseas client during 3QFY19 .
For the nine month period (9MFY19), ARB Bhd said cumulative net profit stood at RM21.98 million versus a net loss of RM734,000 a year earlier. Revenue rose to RM57.65 million, from RM8.34 million.
Looking ahead, ARB Bhd said its IT segment is expected to continue contributing the major portion of the company's sales (revenue) and profit. ""The group believes that there would be more potential and interested clients to be engaged (with), in (the) future,"" it added.
yesterday 5pm 4/11/2019, ARB Bhd's share price closed up 0.5 sen or 1.35% at 37.5 sen, with some 53 million units traded. ARB Bhd was transacted among Bursa Malaysia's most active stocks.lets do this,collect as much as we can!"

Many people are afraid to lose money. They want to sleep soundly every night.
So am I. I am just as fearful as everyone else losing money. Therefore, let me recommend you
""PRESENTING ARBB (7181) THE GOOD STOCK FOR INVESTORS""
Why is ARBB (7181) GOOD?
These are my Reasons:
1) ARBB HAS LOW DEBT
Current Liabilities/Non-Current Liabilities
Borrowings -................. - (near to RM15,000 as at 2Q)
If a company has no borrowings or low borrowings can they go bankrupt if you don't owe money to bank, friends or financial institution?
Their cash in the bank is more than enough to cover all their liabilities.
No one or Company can be low in debt, SO ARBB IS A STOCK ON WHICH YOU CAN BUY AND SLEEP SOUNDLY.
2) HIGH NTA
I do not know why so many analysts or retailers start to use NTA as a valuation-base. I used to heard of PER being popularly used, perhaps ... P/B too. But NTA? Why every tom-dick now talking about the NTA of companies when we are trading/investing? Who started the NTA game? The NTA of ARBB is HIGH NTA value ... therefore, it is under-valued.
Price/NTA = 106.1%
*The closing share price taken is at end June.
So WHY NOT BUY ARBB? GO AHEAD.
To me, I’m all in ready for the spike!
PRICE SURE GOING TO RISES VERY VERY HIGH, TIME IS MONEY AND TIME DOES NOT WAIT FOR NO ONE! GO FOR ARBB, STRIVE TO SUCCESS!"

Author: HLInvest | Publish date: Wed, 30 Oct 2019, 8:56 AM
In anticipation of another positive 3Q19 results in Nov, ARBB’s prices had rallied 20% to RM0.36 from YTD low of RM0.30. We like ARBB, premised on its emphasis on recurring ERP and solar projects, and its recent venture into IoT business after transforming from a multi-year loss-making timber related business. If executed well, ARBB is expected to yield an impressive growth of 140% earnings CAGR from FY18-20, riding on the YTD jobs secured ~RM250m YTD and numerous MOU and MOA business contracts estimated at ~RM1.4bn in June 2019 with local and overseas clients. Valuations are attractive at 0.8x P/B (vs 1Y avg 0.9x) and 19.2x FY20 FD P/E (vs 1Y avg 3.5x), supported by 5sen net cash/share and 0.11x PEG. The stock is expected to advance further in the short term towards RM0.46 amid the rounding bottom formation and bullish downtrend line breakout.
Business profile: From a multi-year loss-making position with its timber related business, ARB has been diversifying into IT solutions business in 3Q18, mainly involved in the business of IT and software solutions, trading of computer hardware and software, system integration, as well as enterprise resource planning (ERP) development and implementation in Malaysia or worldwide. ERP solutions are enterprise software platforms that electronically capture, store, manage and process information in real time.
Bullish signs ahead amid the rounding bottom formation and downtrend line breakout. After forming a saucer bottom pattern near the YTD RM0.30 recently, ARB finally staged a long awaited downtrend line breakout from RM0.51 (1 Aug) high yesterday. The two positive patterns could potentially kick start a new upswing soon, supported by hook-up in technical indicators. Taking out the immediate resistance at RM0.38 (SMA 200D) would spur prices higher towards RM0.40 (50% FR) next before reaching our LT objective at RM0.46 (76.4% FR). Supports are pegged at RM0.335 (SMA 50D) and RM0.325 (mid BB). Cut loss at RM0.315.
Wow, expecting good results, ARBB has been growing in terms of revenue & profit, seems like a good company with growing prospects."

KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 4): ARB Bhd reported today a 4,263% spike in net profit at RM8.29 million in its third quarter ended Sept 30,2019 (3QFY19) from RM186,000 a year earlier, helped by a substantial revenue rise on IT-based income.
According to ARB Bhd's Bursa Malaysia filing today, IT-based income rose as the group's timber segment temporarily ceased operations during 3QFY19, ahead of an expected resumption in December 2019. ARB Bhd said total group revenue during the quarter increased to RM33.94 million, from RM3.8 million a year before.
""For the current quarter under review, the group’s revenue increased by 793% compared to preceding year's corresponding quarter. This was mainly due to the IT segment (which) has contributed RM33.852 million or 99.7% of the total revenue and consequently contributed profit for the group,"" ARB Bhd said.
In a separate statement today, ARB Bhd chief executive officer (investment & technology) Datuk Larry Liew Kok Leong said: ""The strong performance is a mix of successful execution of our business strategies and strong organic growth.”
In its Bursa filing, ARB Bhd said its major revenue contributors were wholly-owned subsidiaries ARB Development Sdn Bhd and ARBIOT Sdn Bhd.
""These two subsidiary companies are principally involved in carrying on the business of reselling customised enterprise resource planning (ERP) software system, and Internet of Things, Internet and Multimedia development, and consultancy services,"" ARB Bhd said.
According to ARB Bhd, ARB Development had entered into an approximately US$20 million (about RM83 million) IT contract with an overseas client during 3QFY19 .
For the nine month period (9MFY19), ARB Bhd said cumulative net profit stood at RM21.98 million versus a net loss of RM734,000 a year earlier. Revenue rose to RM57.65 million, from RM8.34 million.
Looking ahead, ARB Bhd said its IT segment is expected to continue contributing the major portion of the company's sales (revenue) and profit. ""The group believes that there would be more potential and interested clients to be engaged (with), in (the) future,"" it added.
At 5pm, ARB Bhd's share price closed up 0.5 sen or 1.35% at 37.5 sen, with some 53 million units traded. ARB Bhd was transacted among Bursa Malaysia's most active stocks."

For starters, IR 4.0 in its very essence looks at the incorporation of automation and data exchange in manufacturing processes. It is, however, not limited to manufacturing processes alone, but extends to business processes that cut across sectors.
Be it agriculture, food and beverage (F&B), accounting, or even fisheries, there is a solution that could aid in improving efficiency and increasing yield.
Incorporating IR 4.0 may sound like a daunting task for many SMEs but it is important to realise there is a solution for every market vertical at every price point or scale.
“In today’s environment, most companies might already have an IT system in place that they have been using for years.
Nazeroll says it is high time SMEs update their IT solutions
“The drive towards IR 4.0 is for them to look at their existing processes and ask, how can I be competitive while improving efficiency in the way we do things,” explains Infor (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd country manager Nazeroll Kasim.
He adds it is high time for SMEs that have invested in enterprise resource planning (ERP) software to consider refreshing their systems and revamping their operations.
Infor is a global business applications software company. Nazeroll explains that its Malaysian customers from the manufacturing sector would often deploy digital solutions on an end-to-end basis as opposed to rolling them out in stages across different business divisions.
“It is uncommon for a manufacturer to roll out a finance application first and then opt for a system that manages its production workflow.
“Businesses that purchase ERP solutions often look to address their core business functions,” he says.
Nazeroll says ERP solutions have changed as they used to be sold as a basic system with customisation modules.
Customisation is expensive and features that are standard now were not offered in older versions.
“When the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was implemented in 2015, most ERP solutions were retrofitted with a GST module. Today, latest releases have the GST module as a standard,” he notes."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=94","Nov 6, 2019 9:28 AM","THEREALDEAL","Demystifying digital business
IR 4.0 is about automation and data exchange. In a manufacturing context, this would mean introducing robotics and sensors to replace human labour for tasks that could be automated.
It could also extend to other areas such as finance where an automated system would be able to generate invoices or sales reports through the help of online tools; without having to bother the accounts clerk, say at 7am, for an overdue report.
Entrepreneurs who are not ready to take the plunge may start by trying freeware offered online. However, these are often limited in terms of features.
One of the many elements of IR 4.0 is connected devices. These come in a wide range of products from motion sensors and Bluetooth-enabled trackers to surveillance cameras.
A food processing plant, for example, may be connected to thermometers placed in strategic locations in the facility.
In the event of a drastic shift in temperature, the thermometers would alert the staff and suggest pre-programmed measures to take as changes in temperature can result in food contamination or loss of quality.
Beyond food safety, changes in temperature could signal other problems such as faulty air-conditioning.
Data generated from connected devices and systems can be used to analyse business trends or to forecast changes to the business operations such as how often an asset breaks down to the number of medical leave an employee takes over the course of his employment.
These data would then help entrepreneurs to make informed decisions on how to proceed with their business.
“The first question an entrepreneur needs to ask internally is what the objectives of the organisation are and what industry it is in.
“That way, he is able to see whether to embark on the digital journey upfront or, depending on capital, whether to start with a mix of solutions,” says Nazeroll.
Do be prepared for a three- to six-month implementation time frame should you choose to go the digital route. This period generally includes the time needed to train staff before going live.
Vallen Asia CEO Andrew Bennett says staff who are accustomed to the previous or existing system would often find it difficult to migrate to a new system.
Its business-to-business (B2B) distribution services have over 40 staff spread across three facilities in Penang, Selangor and Johor.
“It was a slight struggle for finance (department) as it had to integrate the new system with our bank’s system such as accounts payable. Those types of issues are generally time sensitive,” he says.
Not all staff members are sent for training with the software solution vendors. Super users identified by the company are sent for training three months ahead of the implementation."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=94","Nov 6, 2019 9:28 AM","THEREALDEAL","Start with smallest unit
Once that was completed, they are sent back to their respective offices to train other users. Staff are incentivised via flexible working hours or shorter work days to accommodate the training schedule and modules.
Entrepreneurs who are not keen to embark on a complete overhaul of their IT solutions can consider starting with non-core business processes such as asset management.
“Always go with your smallest business unit for full implementation and then move to other units,” suggests Bennett.
He adds the successful implementation on a smaller scale can be used as a template to move on to other business units or even regional offices.
Nazeroll suggests that SMEs be prepared to invest anywhere between RM100,000 and RM150,000 for a digital business solution that caters for 20 users.
“The price depends on how many features you want to implement in your system and also the number of users,” he adds.
Depending on company requirements, they could choose to opt for subscription-based cloud applications with packages that consist of monthly or yearly charges as compared to a pricier on-premises licence purchase."

Performance:
Turnover: RM33.9m YoY rose 792.7% QoQ rose 200.9%
Net profit: RM 8.3m YoY rose 4359.1% QoQ fell 3.7%
Main Reason:
Compared with the same quarter last year, ARBB's turnover increased by 792.7%, mainly contributing to IT business, about 99.7%. This also led to a rise in profits.
Compared with the previous quarter, the 2019 Q3 turnover mainly contributed to ARB Development Sdn Bhd and ARBBOIT Sdn Bhd.
The two subsidiaries mainly sell ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software, IOT, Internet and consulting services.
Future Prospect:
Previously ARBB was a wood-related business that was suspended during the quarter but will be relaunched again in Dec 2019.
For the IT department, the subsidiary ARB Development Sdn. Bhd. already has a contract and has already started in 2019 Q3. The contract is expected to be worth approximately USD 20mil. Management believes that it will attract more potential and interested customers in the future.
EPS:
At 2019 Q3, ARBB's profit was 3.54 cents recorded on RM 8.3m EPS. Compared to the previous quarter, ARBB earned up to RM 8.6m, but EPS recorded 6.54 cents.
Almost the same profit, but the EPS is so much different. The main reason is that too many ""Conversation of Preference Share"" caused the EPS to be diluted.
Although the company's earnings are good, for long-term EPS dilution, this will adversely affect the stock price. After all, more and more shares will lead to lower and lower EPS. In theory, the stock price will gradually decline.
To understand the further detail on the ARBB Preference Share conversion:
Preference Share is considering a stock for the shareholders. Usually preferred stocks have some special offers, such as dividends.
Preference stocks are not equal to ordinary shares. Therefore, EPS does not need to be included in Preference stock.
And since earnings per share (EPS) is a measure used to measure the return on ordinary stock. Therefore, stock exchange websites and software in the calculation of EPS will not be included with the Preference stock.
ARBB has released a maximum of 1,008,150,000 preferred shares on Dec 18, and shareholders were able to convert into (1) 20 Preference shares convert into 1 ordinary share or (2) conversion price of 20 cent per Preference Share.
In the past few months, shareholders have been converted Preference shares into ordinary shares at 20 cents. It has already converted 179,666,400 units, and balance of 828,483,600 units.
As of today, ARBB's shares are 246,876,400 units, assuming the remaining 828,483,600 Preference shares are converted into ordinary stock. ARBB's shares will be as high as 1,075,360,000 units.
In the latest 4 quarters, the company's profit is 26.943m, the number of shares is 246.8m, and the EPS will be 10.91 cents. Calculated at a price of 38.5 cents, PE will be 3.53
If the company can remain its performance in 3Q19 (8.3m), it will be as high as 33mil in the whole year. Based on the maximum number of shares (1,075,360,000), the EPS will be 3.09 cents, the stock price is 38.5 cents, and the PE is 12.48."

Listen to the wisdom of Sir John Templeton
Bull market is born in pessimism, grows in skepticism, matures in optimism and dies in euphoria
It started in pessimism when ARBB was traded around 0.305sen.
IB investment Banks and Fund Managers will not bother to take a second look at ARBB at such lousy price of 0.305 sen
Stock brokers won't recommend it to their clients for fear of uncertainty
AND public are generally and universally pessimistic as a whole
This is the best time THE REAL DEAL like to do a research
1st. Have insiders sold out and prepared to run away like Transmile, Megan media, utusan or others?
Ha. If insiders buying then THE REAL DEAL sit up and do deeper Research
2. FA. Is this company still fundamentally sound?
Yes. ARBB HAS ZERO BORROWINGS AND HAS A LOT CASH IN COMPANY.
3. DIRECTORS OK?

SO OK. PASSED
4. IS ARBB COMPETENT?
YES

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=96","Nov 8, 2019 10:30 AM","nationaltreasure","Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is the integrated management of main business processes, often in real-time and mediated by software and technology.
ERP is usually referred to as a category of business management software — typically a suite of integrated applications—that an organization can use to collect, store, manage, and interpret data from these many business activities.
ERP provides an integrated and continuously updated view of core business processes using common databases maintained by a database management system. ERP systems track business resources—cash, raw materials, production capacity—and the status of business commitments: orders, purchase orders, and payroll. The applications that make up the system share data across various departments (manufacturing, purchasing, sales, accounting, etc.) that provide the data. ERP facilitates information flow between all business functions and manages connections to outside stakeholders.
Enterprise system software is a multibillion-dollar industry that produces components supporting a variety of business functions. IT investments have become the largest category of capital expenditure in United States-based businesses over the past[which?] decade. Though early ERP systems focused on large enterprises, smaller enterprises increasingly use ERP systems.
The ERP system integrates varied organizational systems and facilitates error-free transactions and production, thereby enhancing the organization's efficiency. However, developing an ERP system differs from traditional system development.ERP systems run on a variety of computer hardware and network configurations, typically using a database as an information repository.
The Gartner Group first used the abbreviation ERP in the 1990s to include the capabilities of material requirements planning (MRP), and the later manufacturing resource planning (MRP II), as well as computer-integrated manufacturing. Without replacing these terms, ERP came to represent a larger whole that reflected the evolution of application integration beyond manufacturing.
Not all ERP packages are developed from a manufacturing core; ERP vendors variously began assembling their packages with finance-and-accounting, maintenance, and human-resource components. By the mid-1990s ERP systems addressed all core enterprise functions. Governments and non–profit organizations also began to use ERP systems
ERP systems experienced rapid growth in the 1990s. Because of the year 2000 problem and the introduction of the euro that disrupted legacy systems, many companies took the opportunity to replace their old systems with ERP.
ERP systems initially focused on automating back office functions that did not directly affect customers and the public. Front office functions, such as customer relationship management (CRM), dealt directly with customers, or e-business systems such as e-commerce, e-government, e-telecom, and e-finance—or supplier relationship management (SRM) became integrated later, when the internet simplified communicating with external parties.
""ERP II"" was coined in 2000 in an article by Gartner Publications entitled ERP Is Dead—Long Live ERP II. It describes web–based software that provides real–time access to ERP systems to employees and partners (such as suppliers and customers). The ERP II role expands traditional ERP resource optimization and transaction processing. Rather than just manage buying, selling, etc.—ERP II leverages information in the resources under its management to help the enterprise collaborate with other enterprises. ERP II is more flexible than the first generation ERP. Rather than confine ERP system capabilities within the organization, it goes beyond the corporate walls to interact with other systems. Enterprise application suite is an alternate name for such systems. ERP II systems are typically used to enable collaborative initiatives such as supply chain management (SCM), customer relationship management (CRM), and business intelligence (BI) among business partner organizations through the use of various e-business technologies.
Developers now make more effort to integrate mobile devices with the ERP system. ERP vendors are extending ERP to these devices, along with other business applications. Technical stakes of modern ERP concern integration—hardware, applications, networking, supply chains. ERP now covers more functions and roles—including decision making, stakeholders' relationships, standardization, transparency, globalization,
ERP systems typically include the following characteristics:
An integrated system
Operates in (or near) real time
A common database that supports all the applications
A consistent look and feel across modules
Installation of the system with elaborate application/data integration by the Information Technology (IT) department, provided the implementation is not done in small steps
Deployment options include: on-premises, cloud hosted, or SaaS"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=96","Nov 8, 2019 10:30 AM","nationaltreasure","An ERP system covers the following common functional areas. In many ERP systems, these are called and grouped together as ERP modules:
Financial accounting: general ledger, fixed assets, payables including vouchering, matching and payment, receivables and collections, cash management, financial consolidation
Management accounting: budgeting, costing, cost management, activity based costing
Human resources: recruiting, training, rostering, payroll, benefits, retirement and pension plans, diversity management, retirement, separation
Manufacturing: engineering, bill of materials, work orders, scheduling, capacity, workflow management, quality control, manufacturing process, manufacturing projects, manufacturing flow, product life cycle management
Order processing: order to cash, order entry, credit checking, pricing, available to promise, inventory, shipping, sales analysis and reporting, sales commissioning
Supply chain management: supply chain planning, supplier scheduling, product configurator, order to cash, purchasing, inventory, claim processing, warehousing (receiving, putaway, picking and packing)
Project management: project planning, resource planning, project costing, work breakdown structure, billing, time and expense, performance units, activity management
Customer relationship management (CRM): sales and marketing, commissions, service, customer contact, call center support – CRM systems are not always considered part of ERP systems but rather business support systems (BSS)
Data services : various ""self–service"" interfaces for customers, suppliers and/or employees
GRP
Government resource planning (GRP) is the equivalent of an ERP for the public sector and an integrated office automation system for government bodies.The software structure, modularization, core algorithms and main interfaces do not differ from other ERPs, and ERP software suppliers manage to adapt their systems to government agencies.
Both system implementations, in private and public organizations, are adopted to improve productivity and overall business performance in organizations, but comparisons (private vs. public) of implementations shows that the main factors influencing ERP implementation success in the public sector are cultural.
Most ERP systems incorporate best practices. This means the software reflects the vendor's interpretation of the most effective way to perform each business process. Systems vary in how conveniently the customer can modify these practices.In addition, best practices reduced risk by 71% compared to other software implementations.
Use of best practices eases compliance with requirements such as IFRS, Sarbanes-Oxley, or Basel II. They can also help comply with de facto industry standards, such as electronic funds transfer. This is because the procedure can be readily codified within the ERP software and replicated with confidence across multiple businesses who share that business requirement.
ERP systems connect to real–time data and transaction data in a variety of ways. These systems are typically configured by systems integrators, who bring unique knowledge on process, equipment, and vendor solutions.
Direct integration—ERP systems have connectivity (communications to plant floor equipment) as part of their product offering. This requires that the vendors offer specific support for the plant floor equipment their customers operate. ERP vendors must be experts in their own products and connectivity to other vendor products, including those of their competitors.
Database integration—ERP systems connect to plant floor data sources through staging tables in a database. Plant floor systems deposit the necessary information into the database. The ERP system reads the information in the table. The benefit of staging is that ERP vendors do not need to master the complexities of equipment integration. Connectivity becomes the responsibility of the systems integrator.
Enterprise appliance transaction modules (EATM)—These devices communicate directly with plant floor equipment and with the ERP system via methods supported by the ERP system. EATM can employ a staging table, web services, or system–specific program interfaces (APIs). An EATM offers the benefit of being an off–the–shelf solution.
Custom–integration solutions—Many system integrators offer custom solutions. These systems tend to have the highest level of initial integration cost, and can have a higher long term maintenance and reliability costs. Long term costs can be minimized through careful system testing and thorough documentation. Custom–integrated solutions typically run on workstation or server-class computers."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=96","Nov 8, 2019 10:31 AM","nationaltreasure","Implementation
ERP's scope usually implies significant changes to staff work processes and practices.Generally, three types of services are available to help implement such changes—consulting, customization, and support.Implementation time depends on business size, number of modules, customization, the scope of process changes, and the readiness of the customer to take ownership for the project. Modular ERP systems can be implemented in stages. The typical project for a large enterprise takes about 14 months and requires around 150 consultants.Small projects can require months; multinational and other large implementations can take years.Customization can substantially increase implementation times.
Besides that, information processing influences various business functions e.g. some large corporations like Wal-Mart use a just in time inventory system. This reduces inventory storage and increases delivery efficiency, and requires up-to-date data. Before 2014, Walmart used a system called Inforem developed by IBM to manage replenishment.
Process preparation
Implementing ERP typically requires changes in existing business processes. Poor understanding of needed process changes prior to starting implementation is a main reason for project failure. The difficulties could be related to the system, business process, infrastructure, training, or lack of motivation.
It is therefore crucial that organizations thoroughly analyze business processes before they implement ERP software. Analysis can identify opportunities for process modernization. It also enables an assessment of the alignment of current processes with those provided by the ERP system. Research indicates that risk of business process mismatch is decreased by:
Linking current processes to the organization's strategy
Analyzing the effectiveness of each process
Understanding existing automated solutions
ERP implementation is considerably more difficult (and politically charged) in decentralized organizations, because they often have different processes, business rules, data semantics, authorization hierarchies, and decision centers.This may require migrating some business units before others, delaying implementation to work through the necessary changes for each unit, possibly reducing integration (e.g., linking via Master data management) or customizing the system to meet specific needs.
A potential disadvantage is that adopting ""standard"" processes can lead to a loss of competitive advantage. While this has happened, losses in one area are often offset by gains in other areas, increasing overall competitive advantage.
Configuration
Configuring an ERP system is largely a matter of balancing the way the organization wants the system to work with the way it was designed to work. ERP systems typically include many settings that modify system operations. For example, an organization can select the type of inventory accounting—FIFO or LIFO—to use; whether to recognize revenue by geographical unit, product line, or distribution channel; and whether to pay for shipping costs on customer returns.
Two tier enterprise resource planning
Two-tier ERP software and hardware lets companies run the equivalent of two ERP systems at once: one at the corporate level and one at the division or subsidiary level. For example, a manufacturing company could use an ERP system to manage across the organization using independent global or regional distribution, production or sales centers, and service providers to support the main company’s customers. Each independent center (or) subsidiary may have its own business models, workflows, and business processes.
Given the realities of globalization, enterprises continuously evaluate how to optimize their regional, divisional, and product or manufacturing strategies to support strategic goals and reduce time-to-market while increasing profitability and delivering value.With two-tier ERP, the regional distribution, production, or sales centers and service providers continue operating under their own business model—separate from the main company, using their own ERP systems. Since these smaller companies' processes and workflows are not tied to main company's processes and workflows, they can respond to local business requirements in multiple locations."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=96","Nov 8, 2019 10:31 AM","nationaltreasure","Factors that affect enterprises' adoption of two-tier ERP systems include:
Manufacturing globalization, the economics of sourcing in emerging economies
Potential for quicker, less costly ERP implementations at subsidiaries, based on selecting software more suited to smaller companies
Extra effort, (often involving the use of Enterprise application integration) is required where data must pass between two ERP systems Two-tier ERP strategies give enterprises agility in responding to market demands and in aligning IT systems at a corporate level while inevitably resulting in more systems as compared to one ERP system used throughout the organization.
Customization
ERP systems are theoretically based on industry best practices, and their makers intend that organizations deploy them ""as is"". ERP vendors do offer customers configuration options that let organizations incorporate their own business rules, but gaps in features often remain even after configuration is complete.
ERP customers have several options to reconcile feature gaps, each with their own pros/cons. Technical solutions include rewriting part of the delivered software, writing a homegrown module to work within the ERP system, or interfacing to an external system. These three options constitute varying degrees of system customization—with the first being the most invasive and costly to maintain.Alternatively, there are non-technical options such as changing business practices or organizational policies to better match the delivered ERP feature set. Key differences between customization and configuration include:
Customization is always optional, whereas the software must always be configured before use (e.g., setting up cost/profit center structures, organizational trees, purchase approval rules, etc.).
The software is designed to handle various configurations, and behaves predictably in any allowed configuration.
The effect of configuration changes on system behavior and performance is predictable and is the responsibility of the ERP vendor. The effect of customization is less predictable. It is the customer's responsibility, and increases testing activities.
Configuration changes survive upgrades to new software versions. Some customizations (e.g., code that uses pre–defined ""hooks"" that are called before/after displaying data screens) survive upgrades, though they require retesting. Other customizations (e.g., those involving changes to fundamental data structures) are overwritten during upgrades and must be re-implemented.
Customization advantages include that it:
Improves user acceptance
Offers the potential to obtain competitive advantage vis-à-vis companies using only standard features
Customization disadvantages include that it may:
Increase time and resources required to implement and maintain
Hinder seamless interfacing/integration between suppliers and customers due to the differences between systems
Limit the company's ability to upgrade the ERP software in the future
Create over reliance on customization, undermining the principles of ERP as a standardizing software platform
Extensions
ERP systems can be extended with third–party software, often via vendor-supplied interfaces.Extensions offer features such as:
product data management
product life cycle management
customer relations management
data mining
e-procurement
Data migration
Data migration is the process of moving, copying, and restructuring data from an existing system to the ERP system. Migration is critical to implementation success and requires significant planning. Unfortunately, since migration is one of the final activities before the production phase, it often receives insufficient attention. The following steps can structure migration planning:
Identify the data to be migrated.
Determine the migration timing.
Generate data migration templates for key data components
Freeze the toolset.
Decide on the migration-related setup of key business accounts.
Define data archiving policies and procedures.
Often, data migration is incomplete because some of the data in the existing system is either incompatible or not needed in the new system. As such, the existing system may need to be kept as an archived database to refer back to once the new ERP system is in place."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=96","Nov 8, 2019 10:31 AM","nationaltreasure","Advantages
The most fundamental advantage of ERP is that the integration of a myriad of business processes saves time and expense. Management can make decisions faster and with fewer errors. Data becomes visible across the organization. Tasks that benefit from this integration include:
Sales forecasting, which allows inventory optimization.
Chronological history of every transaction through relevant data compilation in every area of operation.
Order tracking, from acceptance through fulfillment
Revenue tracking, from invoice through cash receipt
Matching purchase orders (what was ordered), inventory receipts (what arrived), and costing (what the vendor invoiced)
ERP systems centralize business data, which:
Eliminates the need to synchronize changes between multiple systems—consolidation of finance, marketing, sales, human resource, and manufacturing applications
Brings legitimacy and transparency to each bit of statistical data
Facilitates standard product naming/coding
Provides a comprehensive enterprise view (no ""islands of information""), making real–time information available to management anywhere, anytime to make proper decisions
Protects sensitive data by consolidating multiple security systems into a single structure
Benefits
ERP creates a more agile company that adapts better to change. It also makes a company more flexible and less rigidly structured so organization components operate more cohesively, enhancing the business—internally and externally.
ERP can improve data security in a closed environment. A common control system, such as the kind offered by ERP systems, allows organizations the ability to more easily ensure key company data is not compromised. This changes, however, with a more open environment, requiring further scrutiny of ERP security features and internal company policies regarding security.
ERP provides increased opportunities for collaboration. Data takes many forms in the modern enterprise, including documents, files, forms, audio and video, and emails. Often, each data medium has its own mechanism for allowing collaboration. ERP provides a collaborative platform that lets employees spend more time collaborating on content rather than mastering the learning curve of communicating in various formats across distributed systems.
ERP offers many benefits such as standardization of common processes, one integrated system, standardized reporting, improved key performance indicators (KPI), and access to common data. One of the key benefits of ERP; the concept of integrated system, is often misinterpreted by the business. ERP is a centralized system that provides tight integration with all major enterprise functions be it HR, planning, procurement, sales, customer relations, finance or analyrics, as well to other connected application functions. In that sense ERP could be described as ""Centralized Integrated Enterprise System (CIES)""
Disadvantages
Customization can be problematic. Compared to the best-of-breed approach, ERP can be seen as meeting an organization’s lowest common denominator needs, forcing the organization to find workarounds to meet unique demands.
Re-engineering business processes to fit the ERP system may damage competitiveness or divert focus from other critical activities.
ERP can cost more than less integrated or less comprehensive solutions.
High ERP switching costs can increase the ERP vendor's negotiating power, which can increase support, maintenance, and upgrade expenses.
Overcoming resistance to sharing sensitive information between departments can divert management attention.
Integration of truly independent businesses can create unnecessary dependencies.
Extensive training requirements take resources from daily operations.
Harmonization of ERP systems can be a mammoth task (especially for big companies) and requires a lot of time, planning, and money.
Critical challenges include disbanding the project team very quickly after implementation, interface issues, lack of proper testing, time zone limitations, stress, offshoring, people's resistance to change, a short hyper-care period, and data cleansing."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=96","Nov 8, 2019 10:32 AM","nationaltreasure","Postmodern ERP
The term ""postmodern ERP"" was coined by Gartner in 2013, when it first appeared in the paper series ""Predicts 2014"". According to Gartner's definition of the postmodern ERP strategy, legacy, monolithic and highly customized ERP suites, in which all parts are heavily reliant on each other, should sooner or later be replaced by a mixture of both cloud-based and on-premises applications, which are more loosely coupled and can be easily exchanged if needed.
The basic idea is that there should still be a core ERP solution that would cover most important business functions, while other functions will be covered by specialist software solutions that merely extend the core ERP. This concept is similar to the so-called best-of-breed approach to software execution, but it shouldn't be confused with it. While in both cases, applications that make up the whole are relatively loosely connected and quite easily interchangeable, in the case of the latter there is no ERP solution whatsoever. Instead, every business function is covered by a separate software solution.
There is, however, no golden rule as to what business functions should be part of the core ERP, and what should be covered by supplementary solutions. According to Gartner, every company must define their own postmodern ERP strategy, based on company's internal and external needs, operations and processes. For example, a company may define that the core ERP solution should cover those business processes that must stay behind the firewall, and therefore, choose to leave their core ERP on-premises. At the same time, another company may decide to host the core ERP solution in the cloud and move only a few ERP modules as supplementary solutions to on-premises.
The main benefits that companies will gain from implementing postmodern ERP strategy are speed and flexibility when reacting to unexpected changes in business processes or on the organizational level. With the majority of applications having a relatively loose connection, it is fairly easy to replace or upgrade them whenever necessary. In addition to that, following the examples above, companies can select and combine cloud-based and on-premises solutions that are most suited for their ERP needs. The downside of postmodern ERP is that it will most likely lead to an increased number of software vendors that companies will have to manage, as well as pose additional integration challenges for the central IT."

She said this will be accomplished via the Malaysia Energy Supply Industry 2.0 (MESI 2.0) plan which will be launched sometime this month.
“The idea is for a more competitive and diversified mix of electricity generation, one that is also more transparent for the industry and consumers,” Yeo said during the 5-in-1 Power Energy Series exhibition at the Malaysia International Trade and Exhibition Centre.
She said the plan will enable green energy trading through a grid, and that it is not compulsory for renewable energy companies to sell electricity to the national electric utility company Tenaga Nasional Berhad.
“There is great potential, as we have just completed the third round of large-scale solar bidding (LSS)
“Technical evaluation is currently underway, and the Energy Commission has ranked the price of the projects from lowest to highest,” Yeo said.
The minister explained the bidding is for 500 megawatt generation, where each bidder has a maximum of 100 megawatts.
“The first four projects amount to 365 megawatts out of 500 megawatts. The bidding price is lower than the cost of gas generation, standing at 23.22 cents.
“In terms of the future, we will see this trend leading to downward costs for renewable energy,” she said.
Yeo compared the price of solar energy for today to several years back, saying at the time when the second round of LSS was being conducted, the reference price stood at 32 cents.
“Today we can reach as low as 17.77 cents, a 45 per cent reduction in just a few years.
“This meant a few years prior it would not have been competitive to go into solar energy on a large scale as it would have disrupted the electric tariffs,” she said.
With the reduction, Yeo said it is timely to look into solar electricity generation.
When asked if this could possibly lower electricity tariffs and consumer bills in the future, the minister said it still depends on many factors, including the global prices of coal and natural gas.
“As much as two-thirds of an electricity bill is affected by these global prices. So this over-dependency on said prices is not a good thing in the long run, especially if it were to go up beyond anyone’s control.
“So when you look at solar energy it is intermittent, working during the day but not in the evening and night. Hence why the government is looking at generation mixture, where solar is used in the morning and gas electricity later in the day,” Yeo said.
MESI 2.0's bidding and tender process will also be defined by its transparency.
“This is what the industry and consumers want, so it will be a priority of the government in the future,” she said.
In order to meet the target of 20 per cent renewable energy generation, Yeo said approximately RM33 billion of investment is required.
“Some of it will come from the government, some from private-public partnership, others will come from private financing.
“For this, the Securities Commission has already conducted a six-month study on green financing by forming a taskforce to provide a report on 21-action items for the facilitation of the RM33 billion investment into renewable energy,” she said.
Yeo added once presented to the government, the report and its action items will be scrutinised and implemented accordingly.
“In the meantime, we will continue our current incentive for the Green Technology Financing Scheme, Green Investment Tax Allowance, and Green Income Tax Exemption, among others,” she said."

In 2018, Malaysia announced that it had set a target of 20% renewable energy in its generation mix by 2025.
The Southeast Asian nation, which is mainly powered by thermal power plants, recorded a two per cent contribution by renewable energy to its generation mix at the end of 2018.
20% renewable energy use by 2025
To achieve its 2025 target it is estimated Malaysia will need RM33 billion (US$8 billion) worth of investments in its renewable energy sector. The expected investments would not only come from the government but from public-private partnerships and private financing.
To increase private participation, the government will clearly need to incentivise private financing. Apart from the continuation of government incentives, such as the Green Technology Financing Scheme, the Green Investment Tax Allowance and the Green Income Tax Exemption, the focus should be on institutional reforms.
The introduction of Net Energy Metering (NEM) programme for solar PV in late 2018 – where PV solar energy will be first consumed and the excess delivered to national utility company Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) on a one-on-one offset basis – has received a positive response.
The scheme applies to all domestic, commercial, industrial and agricultural sectors as long as they are TNB customers. The Ministry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change has allocated 500 MW as the 2019 NEM quota out of which 450 MW is for commercial and industrial buildings and the remaining 50 MW is for residential buildings.
As of May 2019, a total of 16.6 MW of NEM has been approved compared to the approved capacity of 18.24 MW in 2018. The country has over 4.12 million buildings with solar roof-top potential in the peninsula. So the ministry is targeting commercial and industrial buildings to go solar and adopt NEM scheme.
Malaysia’s commitment to renewable solar energy
Apart from the NEM scheme, Malaysia has also introduced the Large Scale Solar (LSS) competitive bidding programme to drive down the cost of energy for the development of large scale solar photovoltaic plant (LSS).
The first tender was released in 2016 with a total aggregate capacity of 200 MW in Peninsular Malaysia and 50 MW in Sabah, followed by the second round in 2017 with an increased total aggregate capacity of 360 MW in Peninsular Malaysia and 100 MW in Sabah/Labuan. The third round of LSS bidding opened up in February 2019 for an estimated RM2 billion ($490 million) worth of projects with a target aggregate capacity of 500 MW and expected commissioning in 2021.
The bidding has been completed and technical evaluation is currently underway. Out of 500 MW, four projects totalling 365 MW actually bid below the gas generation price of 23.22 sen per kWh ($0.056 per kWh).
At the time when the second LSS was conducted the reference price stood at 32 sen per kWh ($0.078 per kWh). The lower prices can be attributed to the technological advancements as well as due to the open bidding for tenders so that the prices are competitive.
Apart from solar PV, the government is also focusing on the pricing related to other renewable energy technologies so that they become competitive with gas-based projects in Malaysia.
The Sustainable Energy Development Authority (SEDA) has introduced competitive bidding for small hydropower and biopower technologies. The inaugural e-bidding for small hydropower systems has been introduced in 2019. A quota of 160 MW has been allocated under this. Each application will be capped at 30 MW per location and the projects should achieve commercial operations by the second half of 2024.
The government has been also conducting e-bidding for biogas technology. The inaugural e-bidding for biogas was carried out in the last quarter of 2018. The second e-bidding for biogas has been scheduled for 2019. The quota allocated is 30 MW with each application being capped at 10 MW per location. The biogas quota is for projects that will achieve commercial operations by H2, 2022.
The implementation of the Malaysia Energy Supply Industry 2.0 (MESI 2.0) plan could drive the country to achieve the target. According to the plan, renewable energy generators do not need to sell electricity to the national utility company TNB. The green energy trading could be done through the grid which would create higher competition.
With a series of measures taken by the government to increase public-private partnership and private financing, the country might witness more investments coming from private players in the renewable energy sector which could ultimately propel the growth of the sector and the country might achieve its 2025 target."

优先股不是普通股。由于每股收益 (EPS)是用来衡量普通股收益的衡量标准。
因此绝大部分的网站，软件在计算EPS是都不会纳入优先股。毕竟理论上，EPS的确不需要纳入优先股。
ARBB 在Dec 18发布了最多 1,008,150,000 优先股，而持有者能以 转换价20仙 转换成普通股 或 20个优先股转换成1个普通股。
在过去一年，持有者都是选择以20 cents转换优先股成普通股。目前已经转换了 179,666,400 units，还剩下828,483,600 unit。
以今天为准，ARBB的股数是246,876,400 units，假设剩下的 828,483,600 的优先股都转换成普通股。ARBB的股数将会高达1,075,360,000 units。
以最新4个季度，公司盈利一共是 26.943m, 股数 246.8m, EPS 将会是 10.91 cents。以股价 38.5 cents 计算，PE将会是3.53
如果公司能保持3Q19年的业绩 (8.3m), 全年将会高达 33m。以最多股数(1,075,360,000) 计算， EPS 将会是 3.09 cents，股价38.5 cents, PE 是 12.48

Performance:
Turnover: RM33.9m YoY rose 792.7% QoQ rose 200.9%
Net profit: RM 8.3m YoY rose 4359.1% QoQ fell 3.7%
Main Reason:
Compared with the same quarter last year, ARBB's turnover increased by 792.7%, mainly contributing to IT business, about 99.7%. This also led to a rise in profits.
Compared with the previous quarter, the 2019 Q3 turnover mainly contributed to ARB Development Sdn Bhd and ARBBOIT Sdn Bhd.
The two subsidiaries mainly sell ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software, IOT, Internet and consulting services.
Future Prospect:
Previously ARBB was a wood-related business that was suspended during the quarter but will be relaunched again in Dec 2019.
For the IT department, the subsidiary ARB Development Sdn. Bhd. already has a contract and has already started in 2019 Q3. The contract is expected to be worth approximately USD 20mil. Management believes that it will attract more potential and interested customers in the future.
EPS:
At 2019 Q3, ARBB's profit was 3.54 cents recorded on RM 8.3m EPS. Compared to the previous quarter, ARBB earned up to RM 8.6m, but EPS recorded 6.54 cents.
Almost the same profit, but the EPS is so much different. The main reason is that too many ""Conversation of Preference Share"" caused the EPS to be diluted.
Although the company's earnings are good, for long-term EPS dilution, this will adversely affect the stock price. After all, more and more shares will lead to lower and lower EPS. In theory, the stock price will gradually decline.
To understand the further detail on the ARBB Preference Share conversion:
Preference Share is considering a stock for the shareholders. Usually preferred stocks have some special offers, such as dividends.
Preference stocks are not equal to ordinary shares. Therefore, EPS does not need to be included in Preference stock.
And since earnings per share (EPS) is a measure used to measure the return on ordinary stock. Therefore, stock exchange websites and software in the calculation of EPS will not be included with the Preference stock.
ARBB has released a maximum of 1,008,150,000 preferred shares on Dec 18, and shareholders were able to convert into (1) 20 Preference shares convert into 1 ordinary share or (2) conversion price of 20 cent per Preference Share.
In the past few months, shareholders have been converted Preference shares into ordinary shares at 20 cents. It has already converted 179,666,400 units, and balance of 828,483,600 units.
As of today, ARBB's shares are 246,876,400 units, assuming the remaining 828,483,600 Preference shares are converted into ordinary stock. ARBB's shares will be as high as 1,075,360,000 units.
In the latest 4 quarters, the company's profit is 26.943m, the number of shares is 246.8m, and the EPS will be 10.91 cents. Calculated at a price of 38.5 cents, PE will be 3.53
If the company can remain its performance in 3Q19 (8.3m), it will be as high as 33mil in the whole year. Based on the maximum number of shares (1,075,360,000), the EPS will be 3.09 cents, the stock price is 38.5 cents, and the PE is 12.48."

Preference Share is considering a stock for the shareholders. Usually preferred stocks have some special offers, such as dividends.
Preference stocks are not equal to ordinary shares. Therefore, EPS does not need to be included in Preference stock.
And since earnings per share (EPS) is a measure used to measure the return on ordinary stock. Therefore, stock exchange websites and software in the calculation of EPS will not be included with the Preference stock.
ARBB has released a maximum of 1,008,150,000 preferred shares on Dec 18, and shareholders were able to convert into (1) 20 Preference shares convert into 1 ordinary share or (2) conversion price of 20 cent per Preference Share.
In the past few months, shareholders have been converted Preference shares into ordinary shares at 20 cents. It has already converted 179,666,400 units, and balance of 828,483,600 units.
As of today, ARBB's shares are 246,876,400 units, assuming the remaining 828,483,600 Preference shares are converted into ordinary stock. ARBB's shares will be as high as 1,075,360,000 units.
In the latest 4 quarters, the company's profit is 26.943m, the number of shares is 246.8m, and the EPS will be 10.91 cents. Calculated at a price of 38.5 cents, PE will be 3.53
If the company can remain its performance in 3Q19 (8.3m), it will be as high as 33mil in the whole year. Based on the maximum number of shares (1,075,360,000), the EPS will be 3.09 cents, the stock price is 38.5 cents, and the PE is 12.48."

Indonesia and Malaysia sourced 12 per cent and 15 per cent of their total electricity output from renewable sources respectively in 2018, based on the EIU estimates.
“Malaysia aims to raise this proportion to 20 per cent by 2025, and Indonesia to 23 per cent by 2025 and 31 per cent by 2050.
“However, these figures look relatively modest compared with efforts elsewhere, and the two countries' governments do not appear to have committed wholeheartedly to shifting their energy mix,” the EIU said in its latest report.
The EIU said Southeast Asia had traditionally relied on fossil-fuel-fired power generation to drive its growth.
It estimates that combustible fuels accounted for 82 per cent of total power generation in 2018 in the region's six largest economies. Yet there are signs that this may be changing.
“In the face of pressure to reduce carbon emissions—as well as a shift in the cost of producing electricity from renewable sources relative to coal—policymakers in some countries are reassessing power policies,” it added.
The EIU said progress towards more sustainable energy strategies had varied substantially among the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
Although fossil fuels still dominate the energy mix in most of the grouping's economies, Singapore and Thailand have at least relied more on natural gas, which produces less carbon dioxide (CO2) when burned.
By contrast, coal - often regarded as one of the dirtiest forms of fuel both in terms of CO2 emissions and more toxic pollutants - continues to play a major role in many of the region's economies.
The EIU estimated that in 2018, coal-fired plants accounted for 31.3 per cent of electricity generation in Vietnam, 42.5 per cent in Malaysia, 45.4 per cent in the Philippines and 52 per cent in Indonesia.
Asean has set a target in 2015 for renewables to account for 23 per cent of the region's energy mix by 2025.
“This target stands out as being relatively modest by global standards, but it will be tough to meet. Even in power generation, which forms only part of the total energy mix, renewables accounted for just 17.6 per cent of total generation in 2018 by our estimates,” the EIU said.

And the exact figure of subscription is 1,429,705,325 ICPS, oversubscribed by 41%.
If there is such thing as closing date, I hope it's alot later.
Else, the price is gonna tank ALOTTTT faster. Bcos, the owner of 1.2Billion share didn't subscribe to have his money burned. They will convert. And probably will quickly convert and sell it off at any price as long it's still above 20sens.
This conversion and selling will only stop when price dropped to 20sen. Only then, there is no reason to foot that 20sen to convert.
Btw, currently, PA is selling at 11sen. That's a whopping 1000% return. If they can sell PA; they will sell that first. But they won't tank the price too quick. Release bit by bit.
Subscribers pays 1sen to the company amounting 140mil. If the whole of the ICPS is taken up by the market; at 10sen, market will pay 1.4Bil to the subscribers. The questions is why market wants to foot that 1.4Bil buying at 1000% premium? And if the whole of 1.4Bil converted, the company raise additional RM280mil. When everything is converted, and for the price to maintain, the market cap would be RM420-450mil market cap.
RM400-450mil market cap; we should be looking at something like RM50mil revenue and RM10mil profit.
Sooo, very likely, price will drop price if ARBB miss the expectation. Bcos current revenue and profit is not worth RM420mil - Rm450mil market cap. Arguably; out of RM450mil; they have RM294mil cash which kinda attractive if Dato's didn't squirrel and squander it off.
On the flip side, if the whole of RM294mil is well invested and generates revenue for 60mil and 15mil profit; I will fair ARBB at 55-60sen. Entry of 33sen might seem great. However, the real opportunity lies at buying PA. Only risk 12sen instead of 33sen. And the REAAAALLLLLL opportunity was last year Dec subscribing PA. 1sen and sell 11sen. But that's not for everyone.
Now learn what's the opportunity. Don't simply punt.
Read....read and readdddddd. Find out what it actually means.
In the market; the opportunity lies in the devils in details."

It is an important source of renewable energy and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power. Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems, concentrated solar power and solar water heating to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light-dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air.
The large magnitude of solar energy available makes it a highly appealing source of electricity. The United Nations Development Programme in its 2000 World Energy Assessment found that the annual potential of solar energy was 1,575–49,837 exajoules (EJ). This is several times larger than the total world energy consumption, which was 559.8 EJ in 2012.
In 2011, the International Energy Agency said that ""the development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating global warming, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise.

ERP software typically integrates all facets of an operation — including product planning, development, manufacturing, sales and marketing — in a single database, application and user interface.
ERP is an Enterprise Application
ERP software is considered to be a type of enterprise application, that is software designed to be used by larger businesses and often requires dedicated teams to customize and analyze the data and to handle upgrades and deployment. In contrast, Small business ERP applications are lightweight business management software solutions, often customized for a specific business industry or vertical.
Today most organizations implement ERP systems to replace legacy software or to incorporate ERP applications because no system currently exists. In fact, a 2016 study by Panorama Consulting Solutions, LLC., indicates that organizations implement ERP for the following reasons:
To replace out-of-date ERP software (49%)
To replace homegrown systems (16%)
To replace accounting software (15%)
To replace other non-ERP systems / had no system (20%)"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=101","Nov 15, 2019 8:46 AM","THEREALDEAL","ERP Software Modules Explained
ERP software typically consists of multiple enterprise software modules that are individually purchased, based on what best meets the specific needs and technical capabilities of the organization. Each ERP module is focused on one area of business processes, such as product development or marketing.
Some of the most common ERP modules include those for product planning, material purchasing, inventory control, distribution, accounting, marketing, finance and HR. A business will typically use a combination of different modules to manage back-office activities and tasks including the following:
Distribution process management
Supply chain management
Services knowledge base
Configure prices
Improve accuracy of financial data
Facilitate better project planning
Automate the employee life-cycle
Standardize critical business procedures
Reduce redundant tasks
Assess business needs
Accounting and financial applications
Lower purchasing costs
Manage human resources and payroll
As the ERP methodology has become more popular, software applications have emerged to help business managers implement ERP in to other business activities and may incorporate modules for CRM and business intelligence, presenting it as a single unified package.
The basic goal of using an enterprise resource planning system is to provide one central repository for all information that is shared by all the various ERP facets to improve the flow of data across the organization.
Enterprise ERP Trends
The ERP field can be slow to change, but the last couple of years have unleashed new technology trends which are fundamentally shifting the entire area. The following new and continuing computing trends have an impact on the growth of enterprise ERP software:
Mobile ERP
Executives and employees want real-time access to information, regardless of where they are. It is expected that businesses will embrace mobile ERP for the reports, dashboards and to conduct key business processes.
Cloud ERP
The cloud has been advancing steadily into the enterprise for some time, but many ERP users have been reluctant to place data in the cloud. Those reservations have gradually been evaporating, however, as the advantages of the cloud become apparent.
Social ERP
There has been much hype around social media and how important —or not — it is to add to ERP systems. Certainly, vendors have been quick to seize the initiative, adding social media packages to their ERP systems with much fanfare. But some wonder if there is really much gain to be had by integrating social media with ERP.
Two-tier ERP
Enterprises once attempted to build an all-encompassing ERP system to take care of every aspect of organizational systems. But some expensive failures have gradually brought about a change in strategy – adopting two tiers of ERP."

Malaysia is a trading nation. As a trading nation it is imperative for
Malaysia to continuously seek to grow the market for the products
it produces.
While Malaysia is abundant with natural resources, it is the manufacturing
sector that has played a key role in turning Malaysia into a major player
in the global value chain apart from rapidly turning the country into an
industrialised nation.
In recent decades, the manufacturing sector has seen rapid evolution. From
mass production through the use of intensive labour force in production
lines, to the use of robotics to increase efficiency, the manufacturing
industry is constantly evolving with more and more infusion of automation.
Today, the next phase of evolution is referred to as the Fourth Industrial
Revolution or Industry 4.0.
The term itself may seem meaningless as revolution is tied to evolution,
a dynamic ongoing process of improvement. But technology, without the
knowledge of application will not contribute to improvement.
Therein lies the substance in the term Fourth Industrial Revolution.
Essentially what it entails is infusing higher value-added process of
manufacturing through the application of advanced digitisation, advanced
manufacturing technologies and efficient resource utilisation.
This would result in enhanced efficiency and reduced dependency of
human labour and ultimately driving competitiveness going forward.
Will this be disruptive to the way we are used to doing things? Again, the
substance lies in the application of available technology. We have seen
how application of information technology and the internet of things have
opened up market supply chains easing access to produce from the most
remote of areas, bringing wealth and prosperity to the rural areas.
Likewise, Industry 4.0 could address many issues concerning
manufacturing with regard to i.e. hazardous environments, health and
safety of human labour, efficiency in managing supply chains, reduction
in wastages, savings in time with efficient management of delivery
systems. The potential for growth is simply limitless, but it all boils down to
knowledge in application.
Already at the global front, the manufacturing sector is reimagining the
future of manufacturing where conventional models are making way for
greater technology adoption and the key determinants are efficiency, speed
and flexibility towards sustaining competitiveness.
In Malaysia, there is a clarion call for the manufacturing sector to shift
to higher value-added process, digitisation, advanced manufacturing
technologies and efficient resource utilisation to drive competitiveness
going forward.
A strong manufacturing sector would pave the way to enhanced
productivity, job creation, innovation capacity, high-skilled talent pool and
ultimately economic prosperity and societal well-being. This would position
Malaysia as a primary destination for smart manufacturing globally and
attract more high-tech investments.
I believe that this can all be achieved through the Industry4WRD: National
Policy on Industry 4.0, which would enable the manufacturing sector to
move into Industry 4.0 and along the way contribute to fulfilling Malaysia’s
commitment to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
I would like to express my appreciation to all parties who have provided
their valuable input and support towards formulating this Policy. I look
forward to all stakeholders combining strengths to realise the future
competitiveness of the Malaysian manufacturing sector.
Let us embrace change, collaborate, innovate and transform to create
value and impact.
Thank you.
YAB TUN DR. MAHATHIR BIN MOHAMAD
Prime Minister of Malaysia"

Arbb(7181 company) Shares are not mere pieces of paper. They represent part ownership of a business. So, when contemplating an investment, think like a prospective owner! We see what Dato Liew Sees! Its The Future of ARBB(7181)!
High risk, high gain.....
SORRY BUT NOT FOR ME, no high risk please!
Should be low risk, high gain
TO BUY WITH MARGIN OF SAFETY
EVERY people are afraid to lose money. They want to sleep soundly every night.
So am I. I am just as fearful as everyone else losing money. Therefore, let me recommend you
""PRESENTING ARBB (7181) THE PERFECT STOCK FOR INVESTORS""
Why is ARBB (7181) GOOD?
REASONS ARE:
1) ARBB(7181) HAS LOW DEBT
Current Liabilities/Non-Current Liabilities
Borrowings -................. - (near to RM15,000 as at 2Q)
If a company has no borrowings or low borrowings can they go bankrupt if you don't owe money to bank, friends or financial institution?
Their cash in the bank is more than enough to cover all their liabilities.
No one or Company can be low in debt, SO ARBB(7181) IS A STOCK ON WHICH YOU CAN BUY AND SLEEP SOUNDLY.
2) HIGH NTA
I do not know why so many analysts or retailers start to use NTA as a valuation-base. I used to heard of PER being popularly used, perhaps ... P/B too. But NTA? Why every tom-dick now talking about the NTA of companies when we are trading/investing? Who started the NTA game? The NTA of ARBB is HIGH NTA value ... therefore, it is under-valued.
Price/NTA = 106.1%
3) TWO MAJOR JOB IS UPCOMING VERY VERY SOON! ITS MEAN SECOND AND THIRD WAVE IS COMING IN!
4) ARBB(7181) IS GOING TO A RIGHT PATH, IR 4.0 INDUSTRY!
SO THE ABOVE PROSPECTS ARE VERY VERY GOOD INDEED
So WHY NOT BUY ARBB(7181)? GO AHEAD.
DONT WAIT AND BUY, BUY NOW AND WAIT!
PRICE SURE GOING TO RISES VERY VERY HIGH, TIME IS MONEY AND TIME DOES NOT WAIT FOR NO ONE! GO FOR ARBB(7181), STRIVE TO SUCCESS!
BEST REGARDS

INVESTMENT IS AT ITS BEST WHEN IT IS MOST BUSINESS LIKE"

But what is it? To put it simply, it is the new approach to combining traditional manufacturing processes and technology such as the Internet of Things (IoT) to improve automation, communication and use of real-time data.
The IoT refers to the billions of physical devices around the world that are now connected to the internet, collecting and sharing data. It touches on almost every aspect of our daily lives.
This is different than during the first industrial revolution which focused only on the use of steam-powered machinery, the second industrial revolution which focused on electrics and the third industrial revolution that leaned on the usage of information technology (IT).
It used to be that televisions functioned only as a medium to disseminate information and provide entertainment to the masses. Today, however, a smart television can detect if those watching it have fallen asleep and switches itself off automatically.
This is an example of how technology, under Revolution 4.0, can tread the line between humans and machine.
Smart homes, smart cars and smartphones are just a few examples of how automation and real-time data are used under Revolution 4.0.
The industrial revolution
The term Industry 4.0 was said to have been used in Germany as early as 2011. However, it only started to gain attention when it was announced during the 2016 World Economic Forum that the world was at the threshold of the fourth industrial revolution.
A senior lecturer at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM)’s Department of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering, Associate Prof Dr Sawal Hamid Md Ali said that the key to the industrial revolution started in the 18th century with the advent of steam-powered engines.
Steam was used to power locomotives and subsequently facilitated major advancements in manufacturing and transportation, among others, resulting in the Industrial Revolution 1.0.
Then, right before World War I, scientists discovered electricity which propelled the Industrial Revolution 2.0, leading to the invention of telephones, aircraft and other vehicles using internal combustion engine.
“With electricity, production could be done on a mass scale, leading to the creation of factories for manufacturing,“ he explained to Bernama.
Industry 3.0 emerged in the late 1960s. It is also known as the digital revolution as it is when electronic devices like cameras, televisions and radios were invented. The development of the internet technology also happened during the era.
Industry 4.0 is said to be based on the digital revolution. However, what distinguishes it from Industry 3.0 is the connectivity between digital technology and humans as well as other physical systems.
“Industry 4.0 is about cyber-physical systems and systems that can connect the digital world with biological systems like humans through the internet.
“In Industry 3.0, the technology doesn’t communicate directly with humans but with Industry 4.0, there is a two-way connection between humans and electronics. This makes humans a part of technology.
“Electronic devices use the data derived from humans to execute its functions better. This is what’s happening with smartphones, smart TVs and smart homes,“ he explained.
The speed of technology
Malaysia is among the countries forging ahead with the Industrial Revolution 4.0.
One of the core technologies of Industry 4.0 is Artificial Intelligence or AI. Through AI, a system is created to learn from its surroundings and use that data to connect humans, physical tools and the digital world.
Another core technology is the robotic process automation (RPA), which is the use of software with AI and machine learning capabilities to mimic human workers, particularly at doing high-volume, repetitive tasks.
Other Industry 4.0 technology are Cloud Computing technology for storing and processing data, IoT that connects a device to smart senses using internet connection, cyber security that protects data and minimises risks and 3D printing that facilitates the production of prototypes.
Other technology involve Virtual Reality which provides visual information in a virtual format, Augmented Reality which combines the physical world with the virtual world and Big Data Analysis which uses collected data to provide service or come up with accurate projections.
Sawal Hamid said that the development and progress of Industry 4.0 depended on the usage of internet technology and big data analysis to propel manufacturing, services and businesses.
“If internet access is not readily available nationwide and the speed is limited, it would adversely affect the development of Industry 4.0."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=103","Nov 18, 2019 9:26 AM","THEREALDEAL","“The success of (ride-sharing and e-hailing app) Grab, a home-grown service, is an example of the dependence on internet technology for advancement. Malaysians are already ready to become a player and mobiliser of this new revolution,“ he said.
Although Malaysia is still a consumer country, it could very well be on its way to becoming a manufacturing country if access to information is made easier through good and affordable internet access.
It can help the community develop a system, app or service utilising, for example, AI and in turn, avail opportunities to others by creating new business models.
One of the mobilising factors of Industry 4.0 is the high processing power coupled with digital storage that drives the manufacturing of high technology products.
“With high processing power, even a small smartphone can run a variety of functions. Today, smartphones are equipped with AI processing which uses data from the surroundings to function better. For example, when taking a photo with our smartphone, AI will automatically assess the surroundings to enable the capture of better pictures.
“The high processing power, as well as high data storage capabilities, is the catalyst for the Fourth Revolution,“ he said.
Highly-skilled and creative
However, many have voiced their concerns about robots taking over human tasks.
Low-skilled manpower like manufacturing operators is among the jobs that would probably be on the line as they are gradually replaced by robots of other computerised systems.
However, highly-skilled manpower to design, develop software and AI and run programmes would be in demand in Industry 4.0.
“Perhaps we may no longer need that many labourers but there is and will be a demand for highly-skilled manpower in the current and future job market,“ he said.
The education system needs to reflect these changes. Students need to be exposed to Industry 4.0 from the primary level.
Students need to be taught in detail how to develop a technology using codes and algorithms. App development, which can be learned from a very young age, need to also be taught in schools.
“The early exposure can help us develop skilled manpower that caters to the job market. Most of this knowledge can easily be learned for free through the internet,“ he said.
Need to change
These rapid changes in the industry require society to change and be part of those mobilising Industry 4.0.
Sawal Hamid said that if they were reluctant to do so on their own, they would find themselves forced to adapt to the changes anyhow.
The e-hailing app Grab, for example, ‘disrupted’ the services of conventional taxis and streaming service Netflix bankrupted video rental service Blockbuster.
“The present technology changes the conventional and those who refuse to keep up will be eliminated by the new technology.
“Technology moves at breakneck speed and the whole world is keeping up with its pace. If we don’t work at it, other countries in the region like Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam will easily overtake us and leave us behind,“ he said."

IR 4.0 is about automation and data exchange. In a manufacturing context, this would mean introducing robotics and sensors to replace human labour for tasks that could be automated.
It could also extend to other areas such as finance where an automated system would be able to generate invoices or sales reports through the help of online tools; without having to bother the accounts clerk, say at 7am, for an overdue report.
Entrepreneurs who are not ready to take the plunge may start by trying freeware offered online. However, these are often limited in terms of features.
One of the many elements of IR 4.0 is connected devices. These come in a wide range of products from motion sensors and Bluetooth-enabled trackers to surveillance cameras.
A food processing plant, for example, may be connected to thermometers placed in strategic locations in the facility.
In the event of a drastic shift in temperature, the thermometers would alert the staff and suggest pre-programmed measures to take as changes in temperature can result in food contamination or loss of quality.
Beyond food safety, changes in temperature could signal other problems such as faulty air-conditioning.
Data generated from connected devices and systems can be used to analyse business trends or to forecast changes to the business operations such as how often an asset breaks down to the number of medical leave an employee takes over the course of his employment.
These data would then help entrepreneurs to make informed decisions on how to proceed with their business.
“The first question an entrepreneur needs to ask internally is what the objectives of the organisation are and what industry it is in.
“That way, he is able to see whether to embark on the digital journey upfront or, depending on capital, whether to start with a mix of solutions,” says Nazeroll.
Do be prepared for a three- to six-month implementation time frame should you choose to go the digital route. This period generally includes the time needed to train staff before going live.
Vallen Asia CEO Andrew Bennett says staff who are accustomed to the previous or existing system would often find it difficult to migrate to a new system.
Its business-to-business (B2B) distribution services have over 40 staff spread across three facilities in Penang, Selangor and Johor.
“It was a slight struggle for finance (department) as it had to integrate the new system with our bank’s system such as accounts payable. Those types of issues are generally time sensitive,” he says.
Not all staff members are sent for training with the software solution vendors. Super users identified by the company are sent for training three months ahead of the implementation."

For starters, IR 4.0 in its very essence looks at the incorporation of automation and data exchange in manufacturing processes. It is, however, not limited to manufacturing processes alone, but extends to business processes that cut across sectors.
Be it agriculture, food and beverage (F&B), accounting, or even fisheries, there is a solution that could aid in improving efficiency and increasing yield.
Incorporating IR 4.0 may sound like a daunting task for many SMEs but it is important to realise there is a solution for every market vertical at every price point or scale.
“In today’s environment, most companies might already have an IT system in place that they have been using for years.
Nazeroll says it is high time SMEs update their IT solutions
“The drive towards IR 4.0 is for them to look at their existing processes and ask, how can I be competitive while improving efficiency in the way we do things,” explains Infor (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd country manager Nazeroll Kasim.
He adds it is high time for SMEs that have invested in enterprise resource planning (ERP) software to consider refreshing their systems and revamping their operations.
Infor is a global business applications software company. Nazeroll explains that its Malaysian customers from the manufacturing sector would often deploy digital solutions on an end-to-end basis as opposed to rolling them out in stages across different business divisions.
“It is uncommon for a manufacturer to roll out a finance application first and then opt for a system that manages its production workflow.
“Businesses that purchase ERP solutions often look to address their core business functions,” he says.
Nazeroll says ERP solutions have changed as they used to be sold as a basic system with customisation modules.
Customisation is expensive and features that are standard now were not offered in older versions.
“When the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was implemented in 2015, most ERP solutions were retrofitted with a GST module. Today, latest releases have the GST module as a standard,” he notes."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=105","Nov 20, 2019 9:57 AM","THEREALDEAL","Why should investors return in November? There are four core reason to this.
Firstly, we have the traditional window-dressing activities, which tends to see some sort of buying interest among fundamentally beaten down stocks. This happens among stocks which are widely held by institutional shareholders and are significantly lower in value than the start of the year and hence some sort of buying momentum could help fund managers to make their year-to-date performance “much better” and reflect the index’s performance.
Second, we are in the midst of the Q3 reporting season and by the end of November, all companies, especially with the December year-end, would report their bottom line numbers in terms of their performance. While Q3 earnings could dictate market’s reaction, i.e. if the reported profits are either above or below estimate, what typically happens at the end of the Q3 period is the change in broking firm’s valuation matrix.
Analysts would roll-over their fair values of the stocks under their coverage based on the next year’s earnings expectations, i.e. next year’s full year earnings forecast will now come into play instead of the 2019 performance. This typically lifts market’s perception on value as companies that are valued based on one-year forward earnings are likely to be more attractive than current year’s earnings, on the assumption that growth trajectory is still intact or improving.
Third, as we usher in the year 2020, the January effect will come into the picture as investors will start to nimble and re-adjust their portfolio for next year’s market’s theme as well as re-positioning on stocks where some fund managers could have locked-in their gains based on this year’s individual stock’s performance.
Fourth, although this is not a typical strategy but markets tend to have a positive momentum going into the Lunar New Year, which is celebrated as early as Jan 25 next year, just one month after Christmas, and not more than three weeks into the trading cycle of the Gregorian New Year.
Hence, with four positive catalysts helping sentiment, perhaps it’s an opportune time to look at the potential beneficiaries of this momentum.
As far as 2019 is concerned, the KLCI is not a benchmark that had performed well but the overall market sentiment was not too bad. We had very strong winners in 2019 among the IR4.0 companies, DRIVEN BY SENTIMENT AND PROJECT AWARDS. SO WHEN TO BUY ARBB(7181)SHARES? I SAY ITS NOW ! NOW OR NEVER !

Stated in the NEWSSSSS-----
PETALING JAYA: Malaysia is targeting to be an Industry 4.0 hub in South-East Asia to regain its status as an Asian Tiger.
Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said there was no choice but to be aggressive in adopting Industrial Revolution 4.0 in view of the accelerated speed in which new technologies evolved.
""With our National Policy on Industry 4.0 (Industry4WRD) launched last year, we aim at driving Malaysia towards becoming the Industry 4.0 hub in South-East Asia,"" he said.
He said this in his keynote address at the International Conference on Industry 4.0: A Global Revolution Towards Business, Technology and Productivity at Segi University Monday (Oct 14).
Dr Mahathir said digital transformation was expected to accelerate a sustainable future for Malaysia, as Industry 4.0 could lead to an increase in the GDP per capita following increased productivity and employment opportunities.
""Our Industry4WRD policy aims at increasing productivity in the manufacturing sector per person in Malaysia by 30% from RM106,647.
""This would elevate the absolute contribution of the manufacturing sector to our economy by 54% from RM254bil to RM392bil,"" he said.
Dr Mahathir said while new technologies could be disruptive, it also boast exciting prospects and challenges.
Following consolidation of Operation Technology and Information Technology (IT), data analytics, process understanding, and the ability to work with disruptive technologies, Industry 4.0 would transform the labour market into a skill-centric force.
Technologies such as the Internet of Things, Advanced Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and Additive Manufacturing are contributing factors to generate an increase in net productivity, he said.
""Hence, to make the adoption of Industry 4.0 a success, a sustainable approach has to be taken to ensure continuous growth of the economy.
""These transformations will not take effect unless we take the first step and our strategy has to be right.
""We need to take the Industry 4.0 transformation seriously. That way we can remain competitive and relevant in the international equation,"" he said.
Malaysia is poised to succeed, as it boast 40 years of experience in the manufacturing sector, apart from having created a good business ecosystem.
Malaysia could capitalise on its existing supply chain, access to the global market, and pool of talented multi-racial and multi- cultural community, said Dr Mahathir.
""For Malaysian businesses to remain competitive, they need to change their business strategy.
""We are sometimes too operational oriented to deliver results.
""Often, we are too conservative to venture into business diversifications and product development.
""This kind of business mentality and culture has to change,"" he said.
Dr Mahathir called on Malaysian businesses to seriously look into investing much more in Research and Development (R&D) to upgrade products and services, apart from improving business processes and embracing integrated technologies.
""We need to change our strategy from being technology traders and users to becoming technology creators,"" he said.
Dr Mahathir also called on universities to focus on developing their R&D capabilities in solving real industry problems.
He said that Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) should also be technology driven.
The Malaysian education system is currently being aligned to the economic needs of the nation, he noted.
""The focus on the teaching of industrial skills ought to be skewed towards innovative knowledge,"" he said.
There must be a push towards innovative thinking and multi-disciplinary knowledge, as Malaysia aimed to increase its high-skilled workforce from 18% to 35% by the year 2020.

The waltz style of dance is a mix of both different flavors with progressive ballroom. It is a very smooth dance and the rhythm of the waltz is one that makes it easier than most other dances to learn together.
The dance style is characterized greatly by the action of rising and falling. The partners doing the waltz together will slide across the dance floor, step, and slide again in a certain tempo. The length of the step is key with the waltz, as is keeping up with the beat of the music. One of the more romantic, slow-paced, and exaggerated dances out there, the waltz is highly accepted around the world as a great form of dance to learn. This type of dance is suitable on the O&G theme.
Right now I'm taking Tango lesson. The tango is very different from the waltz. The tango is a much faster dance style than the waltz, allowing the two partners to pick up the pace greatly with more high-tempo music. The tango is all about the feet and the head action. It is well-known for its quick foot movements, as well as snaps of the head to exaggerate turns and keep up with the music.
The best way to think of the tango is like a much faster version of the waltz. This type of dance is suitable for the next Digital Transformation Economy wave with IR4.0 industry as a game changer. This will involves combination of my best pick on arb 7181 company!

Muhamed Ali Hajah Mydin, who heads the Penang Skills Development Centre (PSDC), said many companies have yet to tap into the RM2 billion allocated by the government towards achieving IR 4.0.
“There is no structured information, for example, if a company needs a soft loan to upgrade to IR 4.0. How do they go about? There is no outlet for them to query about it.
“Now we are going for the next budget, we have to expedite this to move our country forward in the tech race,” Ali told the forum “Driving skills development for a future-ready workforce in Malaysia” at PSDC today.
Ali said approximately 15% and 20% of Malaysian companies had made the move to IR 4.0 because they were forced to do so.
“They are now dealing with Tier 1 Multimedia Super Corridor companies. They are forced to adapt as they have no choice. As for the rest, they remain confused and unguided,” he said.
Dr Mahathir Mohamad launched the National Policy on Industry 4.0 or Industry4WRD last year, to help companies migrate to IR 4.0 in a systematic and comprehensive manner.
Meanwhile, forum participant Foong Lai Lyn said the current confusion was likely due to the number of agencies taking the lead on IR 4.0.
She called for a single agency handling all matters related to IR 4.0 to ensure a smooth migration.
“Currently, it is a maze and having such an agency handholding companies would do a lot of good in our progress,” she added.
Industry 4.0 Malaysia Association president Raja Teagarajan said the government had set a key performance index to help at least 500 companies in their migration to IR 4.0, but only hit 90 companies to date.
“We have about 500,000 companies which are mostly small and medium enterprises (SMEs). We must find ways to expand the net,” he said.
Singapore businessman James Boey said the problem was not unique to Malaysia.
He said most SMEs and companies were at the beginner’s stage of the IR 4.0 and have yet to move to the next phase.
“Many companies have started, but continue to be stuck in the pilot track. And sometimes, the cost factor is also holding back people from embarking on an IR 4.0 migration,” he said."

We’re in the midst of a significant transformation regarding the way we produce products thanks to the digitization of manufacturing. This transition is so compelling that it is being called Industry 4.0 to represent the fourth revolution that has occurred in manufacturing. From the first industrial revolution (mechanization through water and steam power) to the mass production and assembly lines using electricity in the second, the fourth industrial revolution will take what was started in the third with the adoption of computers and automation and enhance it with smart and autonomous systems fueled by data and machine learning.Even though some dismiss Industry 4.0 as merely a marketing buzzword, shifts are happening in manufacturing that deserves our attention.
Industry 4.0 optimizes the computerization of Industry 3.0
When computers were introduced in Industry 3.0, it was disruptive thanks to the addition of an entirely new technology. Now, and into the future as Industry 4.0 unfolds, computers are connected and communicate with one another to ultimately make decisions without human involvement. A combination of cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things and the Internet of Systems make Industry 4.0 possible and the smart factory a reality. As a result of the support of smart machines that keep getting smarter as they get access to more data, our factories will become more efficient and productive and less wasteful. Ultimately, it's the network of these machines that are digitally connected with one another and create and share information that results in the true power of Industry 4.0."

While many organizations might still be in denial about how Industry 4.0 could impact their business or struggling to find the talent or knowledge to know how to best adopt it for their unique use cases, several others are implementing changes today and preparing for a future where smart machines improve their business. Here are just a few of the possible applications:Identify opportunities: Since connected machines collect a tremendous volume of data that can inform maintenance, performance and other issues, as well as analyze that data to identify patterns and insights that would be impossible for a human to do in a reasonable timeframe, Industry 4.0 offers the opportunity for manufacturers to optimize their operations quickly and efficiently by knowing what needs attention. By using the data from sensors in its equipment, an African gold mine identified a problem with the oxygen levels during leaching. Once fixed, they were able to increase their yield by 3.7%, which saved them $20 million annually.
Optimize logistics and supply chains: A connected supply chain can adjust and accommodate when new information is presented. If a weather delay ties up a shipment, a connected system can proactively adjust to that reality and modify manufacturing priorities.
Autonomous equipment and vehicles: There are shipping yards that are leveraging autonomous cranes and trucks to streamline operations as they accept shipping containers from the ships.
Robots: Once only possible for large enterprises with equally large budgets, robotics are now more affordable and available to organizations of every size. From picking products at a warehouse to getting them ready to ship, autonomous robots can quickly and safely support manufacturers. Robots move goods around Amazon warehouses and also reduce costs and allow better use of floor space for the online retailer."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=106","Nov 22, 2019 11:19 AM","huski66","Additive manufacturing (3D printing): This technology has improved tremendously in the last decade and has progressed from primarily being used for prototyping to actual production. Advances in the use of metal additive manufacturing have opened up a lot of possibilities for production.
Internet of Things and the cloud: A key component of Industry 4.0 is the Internet of Things that is characterized by connected devices. Not only does this help internal operations, but through the use of the cloud environment where data is stored, equipment and operations can be optimized by leveraging the insights of others using the same equipment or to allow smaller enterprises access to technology they wouldn’t be able to on their own.
While Industry 4.0 is still evolving and we might not have the complete picture until we look back 30 years from now, companies who are adopting the technologies realize Industry 4.0's potential. These same companies are also grappling with how to upskill their current workforce to take on new work responsibilities made possible by Internet 4.0 and to recruit new employees with the right skills."

clarion call FOR ACTION
The Fourth Industrial Revolution was the centrepiece of conversations
at the World Economic Forum (WEF) on ASEAN in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia in June 2016, in Phnom Penh, Cambodia in May 2017 and
in Hanoi, Vietnam in September 2018. Numerous forums have heaped on
the trend and discussions have been concentrating on how the Fourth
Industrial Revolution would impact the businesses and the entire society
at large.
While some would look at this as a potentially massive opportunity, there
are concerns among the majority of firms and industry sectors as to how
the Fourth Industrial Revolution would transform both the products and
services that will be offered, and the processes or business models that
are used to generate them. The Government, business firms and academia
are now looking at how best to react towards this trend.
With this in mind, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry has taken
the proactive measure to develop this National Policy on Industry 4.0, with
the objective of transforming the Malaysian manufacturing industry and its
related services to be smart, systematic and resilient.
The goal for the future of manufacturing industry is not only to “make
better things” by creating innovative products and services, but also to
“make things better,” by improving design, engineering, service planning
and execution, management and production processes.
The overarching philosophy behind this Policy is A-C-T - Attract, Create
and Transform.
• Attract stakeholders to Industry 4.0 technologies & processes;
• Create the right ecosystem for Industry 4.0 technologies to be adopted
and to nurture innovations; and
• Transform capabilities of the manufacturing industry to be
Industry 4.0-ready.
Although this Policy is designed for the manufacturing industry and its
related services, the strategies are also applicable and could be replicated
in other industries as well, albeit with different sets of priorities and action
plans.
I am heartened to note that within the Government, the support and
cooperation given have been overwhelming where the Technical
Working Groups (TWGs) headed by the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of
Communications & Multimedia, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Human
Resources, Ministry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and
Climate Change and SME Corp. have worked tirelessly to provide inputs
throughout the development of this Policy. Extensive consultations were
also undertaken with the industry and other stakeholders.
Various initiatives supporting the implementation of this Policy have already
been announced. Hence, by the time this publication is in your hand, some
of the action plans would have already been rolled out.
The key to moving forward is to collaborate.
Therefore, I am taking this opportunity to call on all stakeholders to
view this Policy objectively and work together with the Government to
deliver the strategies and action plans towards strengthening Malaysia’s
competitiveness in the long run.
YB DATUK IGNATIUS DARELL LEIKING
Minister of International Trade and Industry, Malaysia"

Industry 4.0 is a term often used to refer to the developmental process in the management of manufacturing and chain production. The term also refers to the fourth industrial revolution.
The term Industry 4.0 was first publicly introduced in 2011 as “Industrie 4.0” by a group of representatives from different fields (such as business, politics, and academia) under an initiative to enhance the German competitiveness in the manufacturing industry. The German federal government adopted the idea in its High-Tech Strategy for 2020. Subsequently, a Working Group was formed to further advise on the implementation of Industry 4.0.
In 2003, they developed and published their first set of recommendations. Their vision entailed that Industry 4.0 remains a term well-known in German-speaking areas. Consequently, this guide will aim at attempting to define the term, exploring the design principles, the advantages and the challenges facing such an approach, and try to quantify the potential lying underneath.
THE HISTORY BEHIND INDUSTRY 4.0
To be able to understand how Industry 4.0 became today’s buzzword, a look at its predecessors might give us a perspective on how this revolution in particular is different. The following diagram shows a timeline of the evolution of manufacturing and the industrial sector in general The First Industrial Revolution
The industrial revolution in Britain came in to introduce machines into production by the end of the 18th century (1760-1840). This included going from manual production to the use of steam-powered engines and water as a source of power.
This helped agriculture greatly and the term “factory” became a little popular. One of the industries that benefited a lot from such changes is the textile industry, and was the first to adopt such methods. It also constituted a huge part of the British economy at the time.
The Second Industrial Revolution
The second one dates between 1870 and 1914 (although some of its characteristics date back to the 1850) and introduced pre-existing systems such as telegraphs and railroads into industries. Perhaps the defining characteristic of that period was the introduction of mass production as a primary means to production in general.
The electrification of factories contributed hugely to production rates. The mass production of steel helped introduce railways into the system, which consequently contributed to mass production. Innovations in chemistry, such as the invention of the synthetic dye, also mark such period as chemistry was in a rather primitive state then.
However, such revolutionary approaches to industry were put to an end with the start of World War I. Mass production, of course, was not put to an end, but only developments within the same context were made and none of which can be called industrial revolutions.
The Third Industrial Revolution
Perhaps the third one is much more familiar to us than the rest as most people living today are familiar with industries leaning on digital technologies in production. However, the third industrial revolution is dated between 1950 and 1970.
It is often referred to as the Digital Revolution, and came about the change from analog and mechanical systems to digital ones.
Others call it the Information Age too. The third revolution was, and still is, a direct result of the huge development in computers and information and communication technology."

The fourth industrial revolution takes the automation of manufacturing processes to a new level by introducing customized and flexible mass production technologies.
This means that machines will operate independently, or cooperate with humans in creating a customer-oriented production field that constantly works on maintaining itself. The machine rather becomes an independent entity that is able to collect data, analyze it, and advise upon it.
This becomes possible by introducing self-optimization, self-cognition, and self-customization into the industry. The manufacturers will be able to communicate with computers rather than operate them.
How will machines communicate?
The rapid changes in the information and communication technologies (ICT) have broken the boundaries between virtual reality and the real world. The idea behind Industry 4.0 is to create a social network where machines can communicate with each other, called the Internet of Things (IoT) and with people, called the Internet of People (IoP).
This way, machines can communicate with each other and with the manufacturers to create what we now call a cyber-physical production system (CPPS). All of this helps industries integrate the real world into a virtual one and enable machines to collect live data, analyze them, and even make decisions based upon them.
INDUSTRY 4.0 COMPONENTS
Although “Industry 4.0” is the common term referring to the fourth industrial revolution, academics still struggle to properly define the approach. This makes it even harder to distinguish the main components of such an approach. In their Literature Review, Hermann, Pentek, and Otto take it upon themselves to find out the main components of the industry.
Given the fact that the term originated in a German-speaking area, they set out to find out the most frequently cited terms and definitions relating to the industry.
In their research, of course, the German equivalent of each term (or perhaps the English equivalent) was used. The results were as follows (Source: “Design Principles for Industrie 4.0 Principle” by Hermann, Pentek, and Otto):

Cyber-Physical Systems, Internet of Things, Smart Factory, and Internet of Services are the most common four terms cited in academic research publications related to the industry. Consequently, and given its initial stage, these are the four main components of the industry.
Cyber-Physical Systems
As mentioned above, a cyber-physical system aims at the integration of computation and physical processes. This means that computers and networks are able to monitor the physical process of manufacturing at a certain process. The development of such a system consists of three phases:
Identification: Unique identification is essential in manufacturing. This is the very basic language by which a machine can communicate. RFID (Radio-frequency identification) is a great example of that. RFID uses an electromagnetic field to identify a certain tag that is often attached to an object. Although such technology has been around since 1999, it still serves as a great example of how Industry 4.0 operated initially.
The Integration of Sensors and Actuator: This is essential for a machine to operate. The integration of sensors and actuators simply means that a certain machine’s movement can be controlled and that it can sense changes in the environment. However, even with the integration of sensors and actuators, their use was limited and does not allow them to communicate with each other.
The Development of Sensors and Actuators: Such development allowed machines to store and analyze data. A CPS now is equipped with multiple sensors and actuators that can be networked for the exchange of information.
The Internet of Things (IoT)
A cyber-physical system still sounds familiar to us today. Machines can exchange data and, in a lot of applications, can sense the changes in the environment around them. Fire alarms are a good example of that. The Internet of Things, however, is thought to be what truly has initiated Industry 4.0.
The Internet of Things is what enables objects and machines such as mobile phones and sensors to “communicate” with each other as well as human beings to work out solutions. The integration of such technology allows objects to work and solve problems independently. Of course, this is not entirely true as human beings are also allowed to intervene.
However, in case of conflicting goals, the case is usually raised to higher positions. According to Hermann, Pentek, and Otto, “"

It is easy to see that in today’s world each and every electronic device is more likely to be connected to either another device, or to the internet. With the huge development and diversity in electronic and smart devices, obtaining more and more of them creates complexities and undermines the utility of each added device.
Smart phones, tablets, laptops, TVs or even watches are becoming more and more interconnected, but the more you buy, the added value of the last device becomes unrecognizable. The Internet of Services aims at creating a wrapper that simplifies all connected devices to make the most out of them by simplifying the process. It is the customer’s gateway to the manufacturer.
Smart Factory
Smart factories are a key feature of Industry 4.0. A smart factory adopts a so called Calm-system. A calm system is a system that is able to deal with both the physical world as well as the virtual. Such systems are called “background systems” and in a way operate behind the scene. A calm system is aware of the surrounding environment and the objects around it.
It also can be fed with soft information regarding the object being manufactured such as drawings and models. According to Hermann, Pentek, and Otto
INDUSTRY 4.0 DESIGN PRINCIPLES
The design principles allow manufacturers to investigate a potential transformation to Industry 4.0 technologies. Based on the components above, the following are the design principles:
Interoperability: Objects, machines and people need to be able to communicate through the Internet of Things and the Internet of People. This is the most essential principle that truly makes a factory a smart one.
Virtualization: CPSs must be able to simulate and create a virtual copy of the real world. CPSs must also be able to monitor objects existing in the surrounding environment. Simply put, there must be a virtual copy of everything.
Decentralization: The ability of CPSs to work independently. This gives room for customized products and problem solving. This also creates a more flexible environment for production. In cases of failure or having conflicting goals, the issue is delegated to a higher level. However, even with such technologies implemented, the need for quality assurance remains a necessity on the entire process
Real-Time Capability: A smart factory needs to be able to collect real time data, store or analyze it, and make decisions according to new findings. This is not only limited to market research but also to internal processes such as the failure of a machine in production line. Smart objects must be able to identify the defect and re-delegate tasks to other operating machines. This also contributes greatly to the flexibility and the optimization of production.
Service-Orientation: Production must be customer-oriented. People and smart objects/devices must be able to connect efficiently through the Internet of Services to create products based on the customer’s specifications. This is where the Internet of Services becomes essential.
Modularity: In a dynamic market, a Smart Factory’s ability to adapt to a new market is essential. In a typical case, it would probably take a week for an average company to study the market and change its production accordingly. On the other hand, smart factories must be able to adapt fast and smoothly to seasonal changes and market trends.
THE BENEFITS AND THE CHALLENGES
Industry 4.0 will truly revolutionize the way manufacturing processes work. However, it’s important to weigh the advantages and the challenges that companies may face.
Advantages of Industry 4.0
Optimization: Optimizing production is a key advantage to Industry 4.0. A Smart Factory containing hundreds or even thousands of Smart Devices that are able to self-optimize production will lead to an almost zero down time in production. This is extremely important for industries that use high end expensive manufacturing equipment such as the semi-conductors industry. Being able to utilize production constantly and consistently will profit the company. According to a study published by PwC,"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=106","Nov 25, 2019 9:35 AM","huski66","Customization: Creating a flexible market that is customer-oriented will help meet the population’s needs fast and smoothly. It will also destroy the gap between the manufacturer and the customer. Communication will take place between both directly. Manufacturers won’t have to communicate internally (in companies and factories) and externally (to customers). This fastens the production and delivery processes.
Pushing Research: The adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies will push research in various fields such as IT security and will have its effect on the education in particular. A new industry will require a new set of skills. Consequently, education and training will take a new shape that provides such an industry will the required skilled labor.
Challenges facing Industry 4.0
Security: Perhaps the most challenging aspect of implementing Industry 4.0 techniques is the IT security risk. This online integration will give room to security breaches and data leaks. Cyber theft must also be put into consideration. In this case, the problem is not individual, but can, and probably will, cost producers money and might even hurt their reputation. Therefore, research in security is crucial.
Capital: Such transformation will require a huge investment in a new technology that doesn’t sound cheap. The decision to make such transformation will have to be on CEO level. Even then, the risks must be calculated and taken seriously. In addition, such transformation will require a huge capital, which alienates smaller businesses and might cost them their market share in the future.
Employment: While it still remains early to speculate on employment conditions with the adoption of Industry 4.0 globally, it is safe to say that workers will need to acquire different or an all-new set of skills. This may help employment rates go up but it will also alienate a big sector workers. The sector of workers whose work is perhaps repetitive will face a challenge in keeping up with the industry. Different forms of education must be introduced, but it still doesn’t solve the problem for the elder portion of workers. This is an issue that might take longer to solve and will be further analyzed later in this report.
Privacy: This not only the customer’s concern, but also the producers. In such an interconnected industry, producers need to collect and analyze data. To the customer, this might look like a threat to his privacy. This is not only exclusive to consumers. Small or large companies who haven’t shared their data in the past will have to work their way to a more transparent environment. Bridging the gap between the consumer and the producer will be a huge challenge for both parties."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=106","Nov 25, 2019 9:35 AM","huski66","THE FUTURE WORKFORCE
Industry 4.0 has a lot to promise when it comes to revenues, investment, and technological advancements, but employment still remains one of the most mysterious aspects of the new industrial revolution. It’s even harder to quantify or estimate the potential employment rates.
What kind of new jobs will it introduce? What does a Smart Factory worker needs to have to be able to compete in an ever changing environment such as this? Will such changes lay off many workers? All of these are valid questions to the average worker.
Industry 4.0 might be the peak of technological advancement in manufacturing, but it still sounds as if machines are taking over the industry. Consequently, it is important to further analyze this approach in order to be able to draw conclusions on the demographics of labor in the future. This will help workers of today prepare for a not so far future.
Given the nature of the industry, it will introduce new jobs in big data analysis, robot experts, and a huge portion of mechanical engineers. In an attempt to determine the type of jobs that Industry 4.0 will introduce or need more labor in, BCG has published a report based on interviews with 20 of the industry’s experts to showcase how 10 of the most essential use cases for the foundation of the industry will be affected.
The following are some of the important changes that will affect the demographics of employment:
Big-Data-Driven Quality Control: In engineering terms, quality control aims at reducing the inevitable variation between products. Quality Control depends to a large extent on statistical methods to show whether a specific feature of a product (such as size or weight) is changing in a way that can be considered a pattern. Of course such a process depends largely on collecting real-time or historical data regarding the product. However, since Industry 4.0 will rely on big data for that, the need for quality control workers will decrease. On the other side, the demand for big data scientists will increase.
Robot-Assisted Production: The entire basis of the new industry relies of the smart devices being able to interact with the surrounding environment. This means that workers who assist in production (such as packaging) will be laid off and be replaced with smart devices equipped with cameras, sensors, and actuators that are able to identify the product and then deliver the necessary changes for it. Consequently, the demand for such workers will drop and will be replaced with “robot coordinators”.
Self-Driving Logistics Vehicles: One of the most important focuses of optimization is transportation. Engineers use linear programming methods (such as the Transportation Model) to utilize the use of transportation. However, with self-driven vehicles, and with the assistance of big data, so many drivers will be laid off. In addition, having self-driven vehicles allows for restriction-free working hours and higher utility.
Production Line Simulation: While the need for optimization for transportation declines, the need for industrial engineers (who typically work on optimization and simulation) to simulate productions lines will increase. Having the technology to simulate production lines before establishment will open up jobs for mechanical engineers specializing in the industrial field.
Predictive Maintenance: Having smart devices will allow manufacturers to predict failures. Smart machines will be able to also independently maintain themselves. Consequently, the number of traditional maintenance technicians will drop, and they’ll be replaced with more technically informed ones.
Machines as a Service: The new industry will also allow manufactures to sell a machine as a service. This means that instead of selling the entire machine to the client, the machine will be set-up and maintained by the manufacturer while the client takes advantage of the services it provides. This will open up jobs in maintenance and will require an expansion in sales.
FINAL THOUGHTS
Industry 4.0 is definitely a revolutionary approach to manufacturing techniques. The concept will push global manufacturers to a new level of optimization and productivity. Not only that, but customers will also enjoy a new level of personally customized products that may have never been available before. As mentioned above, the economic rewards are immense.
However, there are still many challenges that need to be tackled systematically to ensure a smooth transition. This needs to be the focus of large corporations and governments alike. Pushing research and experimentation in such fields are essential.
While speculations regarding privacy, security, and employment need more study, the overall picture is promising. Such approach to manufacturing industries is truly revolutionary."

The internet of things, or IoT, is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.A thing in the internet of things can be a person with a heart monitor implant, a farm animal with a biochip transponder, an automobile that has built-in sensors to alert the driver when tire pressure is low or any other natural or man-made object that can be assigned an IP address and is able to transfer data over a network.
Increasingly, organizations in a variety of industries are using IoT to operate more efficiently, better understand customers to deliver enhanced customer service, improve decision-making and increase the value of the business.
History of IoT
Kevin Ashton, co-founder of the Auto-ID Center at MIT, first mentioned the internet of things in a presentation he made to Procter & Gamble (P&G) in 1999. Wanting to bring radio frequency ID (RFID) to the attention of P&G's senior management, Ashton called his presentation ""Internet of Things"" to incorporate the cool new trend of 1999: the internet. MIT professor Neil Gershenfeld's book, When Things Start to Think, also appearing in 1999, didn't use the exact term but provided a clear vision of where IoT was headed.
IoT has evolved from the convergence of wireless technologies, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microservices and the internet. The convergence has helped tear down the silos between operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT), enabling unstructured machine-generated data to be analyzed for insights to drive improvements.
Although Ashton's was the first mention of the internet of things, the idea of connected devices has been around since the 1970s, under the monikers embedded internet and pervasive computing.The first internet appliance, for example, was a Coke machine at Carnegie Mellon University in the early 1980s. Using the web, programmers could check the status of the machine and determine whether there would be a cold drink awaiting them, should they decide to make the trip to the machine.
IoT evolved from machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, i.e., machines connecting to each other via a network without human interaction. M2M refers to connecting a device to the cloud, managing it and collecting data.
Taking M2M to the next level, IoT is a sensor network of billions of smart devices that connect people, systems and other applications to collect and share data. As its foundation, M2M offers the connectivity that enables IoT.
The internet of things is also a natural extension of SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition), a category of software application program for process control, the gathering of data in real time from remote locations to control equipment and conditions. SCADA systems include hardware and software components. The hardware gathers and feeds data into a computer that has SCADA software installed, where it is then processed and presented it in a timely manner. The evolution of SCADA is such that late-generation SCADA systems developed into first-generation IoT systems.
The concept of the IoT ecosystem, however, didn't really come into its own until the middle of 2010 when, in part, the government of China said it would make IoT a strategic priority in its five-year plan."

An IoT ecosystem consists of web-enabled smart devices that use embedded processors, sensors and communication hardware to collect, send and act on data they acquire from their environments. IoT devices share the sensor data they collect by connecting to an IoT gateway or other edge device where data is either sent to the cloud to be analyzed or analyzed locally. Sometimes, these devices communicate with other related devices and act on the information they get from one another. The devices do most of the work without human intervention, although people can interact with the devices -- for instance, to set them up, give them instructions or access the data.
The connectivity, networking and communication protocols used with these web-enabled devices largely depend on the specific IoT applications deployed.
Why IoT is important
The internet of things helps people live and work smarter as well as gain complete control over their lives. In addition to offering smart devices to automate homes, IoT is essential to business. IoT provides businesses with a real-time look into how their companies’ systems really work, delivering insights into everything from the performance of machines to supply chain and logistics operations.
IoT enables companies to automate processes and reduce labor costs. It also cuts down on waste and improves service delivery, making it less expensive to manufacture and deliver goods as well as offering transparency into customer transactions.
IoT touches every industry, including healthcare, finance, retail and manufacturing. Smart cities help citizens reduce waste and energy consumption and connected sensors are even used in farming to help monitor crop and cattle yields and predict growth patterns.
As such, IoT is one of the most important technologies of everyday life and it will continue to pick up steam as more businesses realize the potential of connected devices to keep them competitive."

The internet of things offers a number of benefits to organizations, enabling them to:
Monitor their overall business processes;
Improve the customer experience;
Save time and money;
Enhance employee productivity;
Integrate and adapt business models;
Make better business decisions; and
Generate more revenue.
IoT encourages companies to rethink the ways they approach their businesses, industries and markets and gives them the tools to improve their business strategies.
Pros and cons of IoT
Some of the advantages of IoT include:
Ability to access information from anywhere at any time on any device;
Improved communication between connected electronic devices;
Transferring data packets over a connected network saves time and money;
Automating tasks helps improve the quality of a business’ services and reduces the need for human intervention.
Some disadvantages of IoT include:
As the number of connected devices increases and more information is shared between devices, the potential that a hacker could steal confidential information also increases;
Enterprises may eventually have to deal with massive numbers -- maybe even millions -- of IoT devices and collecting and managing the data from all those devices will be challenging.
If there’s a bug in the system, it’s likely that every connected device will become corrupted;
Since there’s no international standard of compatibility for IoT, it’s difficult for devices from different manufacturers to communicate with each other.
IoT standards and frameworks
There are several emerging IoT standards, including:
6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low -Power Wireless Personal Area Networks), an open standard defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The 6LoWPAN standard enables any low-power radio to communicate to the internet, including 804.15.4, Bluetooth Low Energy and Z-Wave (for home automation).
ZigBee0, a low-power, low data-rate wireless network used mainly in industrial settings. ZigBee is based on based the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. The ZigBee Alliance created Dotdot, the universal language for IoT that enables smart objects to work securely on any network and understand each other.
LiteOS, a Unix-like operating system for wireless sensor networks. LiteOS supports smartphones, wearables, intelligent manufacturing applications, smart homes and Internet of Vehicles (IoV). The operating system also serves as a smart device development platform.
OneM2M, a machine-to-machine service layer that can be embedded in software and hardware to connect devices. The global standardization body, OneM2M, was created to develop reusable standards to enable IoT applications across different verticals to communicate.
DDS (Data Distribution Service) was developed by the Object Management Group (OMG) and is an IoT standard for real-time, scalable and high-performance machine-to-machine communication.
AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol), an open source published standard for asynchronous messaging by wire. AMQP enables encrypted and interoperable messaging between organizations and applications. The protocol is used in client/server messaging and in IoT device management.
CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol), a protocol designed by the IETF that specifies how low-power compute-constrained devices can operate in the internet of things.
LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network), a protocol for wide area networks, it’s designed to support huge networks, such as smart cities, with millions of low-power devices.
IoT frameworks include:
AWS IoT, a cloud platform for IoT released by Amazon. This framework is designed to enable smart devices to easily connect and securely interact with the AWS cloud and other connected devices.
ARM Mbed IoT, a platform to develop apps for the IoT based on ARM microcontrollers. The goal of the ARM Mbed IoT platform is to provide a scalable, connected and secure environment for IoT devices by integrating Mbed tools and services.
Microsoft’s Azure IoT Suite, a platform that consists of a set of services that enables users to interact with and receive data from their IoT devices as well as perform various operations over data, such as multidimensional analysis, transformation and aggregation, and visualize those operations in a way that’s suitable for business.
Google’s Brillo/Weave, a platform for the rapid implementation of IoT applications. The platform consists of two main backbones: Brillo, an android-based operating system for the development of embedded low power devices; and Weave, IoT-oriented communication protocol that serves as the communication language between the device and the cloud.
Calvin, an open source IoT platform released by Ericsson designed for building and managing distributed applications that enable devices talk to each other. Calvin includes a development framework for application developers as well as a runtime environment for handling the running application."

There are numerous real-world applications of the internet of things, ranging from consumer IoT and enterprise IoT to manufacturing and industrial IoT (IIoT). IoT applications span numerous verticals, including automotive, telecom and energy.
In the consumer segment, for example, smart homes that are equipped with smart thermostats, smart appliances and connected heating, lighting and electronic devices can be controlled remotely via computers and smartphones.
Wearable devices with sensors and software can collect and analyze user data, sending messages to other technologies about the users with the aim of making users' lives easier and more comfortable. Wearable devices are also used for public safety -- for example, improving first responders' response times during emergencies by providing optimized routes to a location or by tracking construction workers' or firefighters' vital signs at life-threatening sites.
In healthcare, IoT offers many benefits, including the ability to monitor patients more closely to use the data that's generated and analyze it. Hospitals often use IoT systems to complete tasks such as inventory management, for both pharmaceuticals and medical instruments.
Smart buildings can, for instance, reduce energy costs using sensors that detect how many occupants are in a room. The temperature can adjust automatically -- for example, turning the air conditioner on if sensors detect a conference room is full or turning the heat down if everyone in the office has gone home.
In agriculture, IoT-based smart farming systems can help monitor, for instance, light, temperature, humidity and soil moisture of crop fields using connected sensors. IoT is also instrumental in automating irrigation systems.
In a smart city, IoT sensors and deployments, such as smart streetlights and smart meters, can help alleviate traffic, conserve energy, monitor and address environmental concerns and improve sanitation.
IoT security and privacy issues
The internet of things connects billions of devices to the internet and involves the use of billions of data points, all of which need to be secured. Due to its expanded attack surface, IoT security and IoT privacy are cited as major concerns.
In 2016, one of the most notorious recent IoT attacks was Mirai, a botnet that infiltrated domain name server provider Dyn and took down many websites for an extended period of time in one of the biggest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks ever seen. Attackers gained access to the network by exploiting poorly secured IoT devices.
Because IoT devices are closely connected, all a hacker has to do is exploit one vulnerability to manipulate all the data, rendering it unusable. Manufacturers that don't update their devices regularly -- or at all -- leave them vulnerable to cybercriminals.
Additionally, connected devices often ask users to input their personal information, including names, ages, addresses, phone numbers and even social media accounts -- information that's invaluable to hackers.
However, hackers aren't the only threat to the internet of things; privacy is another major concern for IoT users. For instance, companies that make and distribute consumer IoT devices could use those devices to obtain and sell users' personal data.
Beyond leaking personal data, IoT poses a risk to critical infrastructure, including electricity, transportation and financial services.
The future of IoT
There is no shortage of IoT market estimations. For example, a few include:
Bain & Company expects annual IoT revenue of hardware and software to exceed $450 billion by 2020.
McKinsey & Company estimates IoT will have an $11.1 trillion impact by 2025.
IHS Markit believes the number of connected IoT devices will increase 12% annually to reach 125 billion in 2030.
Gartner assesses that 20.8 billion connected things will be in use by 2020, with total spend on IoT devices and services to reach $3.7 trillion in 2018."

The economy of Malaysia is the third largest in Southeast Asia,after Indonesia and Thailand, and is the 35th largest economy in the world. Labour productivity in Malaysia is significantly higher than in neighbouring Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines or Vietnam due to a high density of knowledge-based industries and adoption of cutting edge technology for manufacturing and digital economy. According to the Global Competitiveness Report 2018, the Malaysian economy is the 25th most competitive country in the world in the period of 2018–19.
Malaysian citizens lead a much more affluent lifestyle compared to their peers in upper-middle income countries like Mexico, Turkey, and Brazil. This is due to a low national income tax, low cost of local food, transport fuel, household essentials, a fully subsidized single payer public-healthcare and comprehensive social welfare benefit with direct cash transfer. With an income per capita of 28,681 PPP Dollars (2017 World Bank) or 10,620 nominal US Dollars, Malaysia is the third wealthiest nation in Southeast Asia after the smaller city-states of Singapore and Brunei. Malaysia has a newly industrialised market economy, which is relatively open and state-oriented. The Malaysian economy is highly robust and diversified with the export value of high-tech products in 2015 standing at US$57.258 billion, the second highest after Singapore in ASEAN. Malaysia exports the second largest volume and value of palm oil products globally after Indonesia.
Despite government policies to increase income per capita in order to hasten the progress towards high income country by 2020, Malaysia's growth in wages has been very slow, lagging behind the OECD standard. Academic research by the IMF and World Bank have repeatedly called for structural reform and endogenous innovation to move the country up the value chain of manufacturing into allowing Malaysia to escape the current middle income trap. Due to a heavy reliance on oil exports for central government revenue, the currency fluctuations have been very volatile, noticeably during the supply glut and oil price collapse in 2015. However the government stepped up measures to increase revenue by introducing the Sales and Service Tax (SST) at 6% rate to reduce deficits and meet federal debt obligations."

GOOD NEWS FOR IR 4.0 INDUSTRIES AGAIN!
Malaysia to be part of IR 4.0, says PM
BUSAN: Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said the government intends to develop Malaysia to be part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0) and use modern technology to its advantage.
Speaking at the Asean-South Korea Commemorative Summit here today, Dr Mahathir said among the most promising industries in Malaysia is Information Technology and new technologies.
“We may be behind many others but we intend to catch up.
“We need to educate from young where they are more familiar with the new values, new strategy of doing things and new kinds of businesses,” he told a full house session moderated by Yoon Sung Woon of Bain and Company.
The local partner of the global management firm also asked Dr Mahathir on policy changes brought about by the new government as well as the country’s transformation plans.
The premier said Malaysia has always been welcoming towards foreign countries and investors, and this is still relevant despite the change in the government.
However, he said, the government now is strict about combating corruption and does not accept any discrepancies in financial management.
“We still welcome foreign investors,” he said, adding that the fastest way to develop is by inviting foreign investment and acquiring technology.
The CEO Dialogue session, organised by the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry, is held in conjunction with the two-day summit which begins today with a leaders’ welcoming dinner.
Later, the prime minister visited the Malaysian Pavilion at the Invest Asean Exhibition held in conjunction with the summit.
Malaysian exhibitors participating at this event are MIDA, MATRADE, Invest Selangor, Halal Development Corporation, Usaha Strategik Sdn Bhd (USSB), We Build Easy Sdn Bhd and Tourism Malaysia Seoul.
It is expected to receive 10,000 visitors.
Dr Mahathir was briefed by USSB, which produces biomass pellet from oil palm empty fruit bunch.
Its executive director Za’im Hadi Meskam said the prime minister was interested in how the local company developed the product.
USSB initially collaborated with a German company to acquire technology to produce energy pellets from biowaste but later switched to a technology partner from China.
“About 60% of the technology was developed locally and our product is now used by an industrial boiler in Johor “ he said. - Bernama"

By GlobalData Energy
SHARE
In 2018, Malaysia announced that it had set a target of 20% renewable energy in its generation mix by 2025.
The Southeast Asian nation, which is mainly powered by thermal power plants, recorded a two per cent contribution by renewable energy to its generation mix at the end of 2018.
20% renewable energy use by 2025
To achieve its 2025 target it is estimated Malaysia will need RM33 billion (US$8 billion) worth of investments in its renewable energy sector. The expected investments would not only come from the government but from public-private partnerships and private financing.
To increase private participation, the government will clearly need to incentivise private financing. Apart from the continuation of government incentives, such as the Green Technology Financing Scheme, the Green Investment Tax Allowance and the Green Income Tax Exemption, the focus should be on institutional reforms.
The introduction of Net Energy Metering (NEM) programme for solar PV in late 2018 – where PV solar energy will be first consumed and the excess delivered to national utility company Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) on a one-on-one offset basis – has received a positive response.
The scheme applies to all domestic, commercial, industrial and agricultural sectors as long as they are TNB customers. The Ministry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change has allocated 500 MW as the 2019 NEM quota out of which 450 MW is for commercial and industrial buildings and the remaining 50 MW is for residential buildings.
As of May 2019, a total of 16.6 MW of NEM has been approved compared to the approved capacity of 18.24 MW in 2018. The country has over 4.12 million buildings with solar roof-top potential in the peninsula. So the ministry is targeting commercial and industrial buildings to go solar and adopt NEM scheme.
Malaysia’s commitment to renewable solar energy
Apart from the NEM scheme, Malaysia has also introduced the Large Scale Solar (LSS) competitive bidding programme to drive down the cost of energy for the development of large scale solar photovoltaic plant (LSS).
The first tender was released in 2016 with a total aggregate capacity of 200 MW in Peninsular Malaysia and 50 MW in Sabah, followed by the second round in 2017 with an increased total aggregate capacity of 360 MW in Peninsular Malaysia and 100 MW in Sabah/Labuan. The third round of LSS bidding opened up in February 2019 for an estimated RM2 billion ($490 million) worth of projects with a target aggregate capacity of 500 MW and expected commissioning in 2021.
The bidding has been completed and technical evaluation is currently underway. Out of 500 MW, four projects totalling 365 MW actually bid below the gas generation price of 23.22 sen per kWh ($0.056 per kWh).
At the time when the second LSS was conducted the reference price stood at 32 sen per kWh ($0.078 per kWh). The lower prices can be attributed to the technological advancements as well as due to the open bidding for tenders so that the prices are competitive.
Apart from solar PV, the government is also focusing on the pricing related to other renewable energy technologies so that they become competitive with gas-based projects in Malaysia.
The Sustainable Energy Development Authority (SEDA) has introduced competitive bidding for small hydropower and biopower technologies. The inaugural e-bidding for small hydropower systems has been introduced in 2019. A quota of 160 MW has been allocated under this. Each application will be capped at 30 MW per location and the projects should achieve commercial operations by the second half of 2024.
The government has been also conducting e-bidding for biogas technology. The inaugural e-bidding for biogas was carried out in the last quarter of 2018. The second e-bidding for biogas has been scheduled for 2019. The quota allocated is 30 MW with each application being capped at 10 MW per location. The biogas quota is for projects that will achieve commercial operations by H2, 2022.
The implementation of the Malaysia Energy Supply Industry 2.0 (MESI 2.0) plan could drive the country to achieve the target. According to the plan, renewable energy generators do not need to sell electricity to the national utility company TNB. The green energy trading could be done through the grid which would create higher competition.
With a series of measures taken by the government to increase public-private partnership and private financing, the country might witness more investments coming from private players in the renewable energy sector which could ultimately propel the growth of the sector and the country might achieve its 2025 target.
the best thing is arb big project is coming very soon, second and third wave, big big wave is nearby! have a great day ahead guys!"

getting the manufacturing INDUSTRY READY
The rapidly-evolving global manufacturing landscape calls for
manufacturing firms to re-evaluate their current approaches and
strategies to remain relevant and competitive.
This Policy, in essence, outlines 13 broad strategies for Malaysia to embark
on a journey that will transform the manufacturing industry landscape
over the next decade. MITI believes that this journey towards Industry 4.0
adoption is anchored on three shift factors: People, Process and Technology.
People: putting people and the entire organisation as a priority. This Policy
focuses on strategies towards creating differentiated talent acquisition,
developing the required human capital and retaining our existing talents by
providing them with the right support.
Process: improving the manufacturing and the whole business processes
by encouraging smart and strategic public-private partnerships. We
remain committed to ensuring the manufacturing sector continues to
contribute significantly to the nation’s economic prosperity. To propel this
further, we are working towards improving the business environment to
reform unfavourable or overly-bureaucratic policies, attracting high value
investments for greater economic development and strengthening the
overall infrastructure for the manufacturing sector, while seeking greater
partnerships with the industry.
Technology: advancement and convergence of technologies are
increasingly underpinning global manufacturing competitiveness. We
acknowledge that many leading manufacturing firms have started to
adopt and implement smart manufacturing solutions where advanced
hardware are now combined with advanced software, sensors as well as
data analytics. This move has resulted in smarter products, processes, and
more closely connected customers and suppliers along the firms’ value
chains. The Government’s role in the whole transformation process is
as an enabler, as such, this Policy is aimed at ensuring the adoption of
Industry 4.0 technologies is done as seamless as possible, and that those
technologies are equally accessible to SMEs.
We would also like to see greater leverage on the strength of ecosystem
partnerships beyond traditional manufacturing boundaries. These
strategies which are aimed at embracing a broader ecosystem approach
as well as developing and taking advantage of integrated manufacturing
and technology clusters and partners, are key determinants in moving
forward. We need to develop a balanced approach across the whole
ecosystem as increasingly sophisticated tools and strategies will be
required to optimise the manufacturing industry from talent, technological,
operational, financial, tax and regulatory perspectives.
This Policy is not a panacea to all issues surrounding the industry. What
we are hopeful for is for it to provide the basis and support for firms to
do things differently in order to stay competitive. For that to happen, the
Government hopes that the Policy would serve as the impetus for our
industry to make the leap into Industry 4.0.

Machines that autonomously detect when they need spare parts. Production systems that run their own quality control during operation, reducing inspection outlays. Robots that autonomously recognize and move components. Scenarios like these are gradually becoming a reality in industrial production.
They’re founded on future technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and edge computing. These offer immense opportunities for the discrete and process industries because they open up new business models and productivity potential. This makes them indispensable to ensure industrial companies’ competitiveness in the world of tomorrow.
Data as the foundation for new technologies
The technologies of the future will be founded on the availability of data. And those data are becoming available in abundance, thanks to the digital transformation of industry. Digital solutions like Siemens’ Digital Enterprise portfolio are already reflecting every step in industrial production – from a product’s design, to its production, to its use – in virtual form, with what’s known as a digital twin.
What’s more, these steps are getting better and better interlinked to one another digitally, to yield extensive data pools. Future technologies now make it possible to analyse and exploit these data pools in entirely new ways.
The example of AI clearly shows what that means. In itself, AI isn’t especially new. Siemens, for example, installed neural networks in steel mills as far back as the 1990s. But the technology has made enormous progress since then.
Computing power has increased many times over. Algorithms have become much better. Hardware in factory halls performs better. And data transfer has accelerated immensely. That means the rising volume of available data can be collected and analysed many times faster and more comprehensively than before, and data analysis has become much more sophisticated.
To that end, we need platforms like MindSphere, Siemens’ open, cloud-based operating system for the Internet of Things (IoT).
Getting industry ready for future technologies
On a platform like this, users can do more than gather and view data – they can also analyse them using AI algorithms, and make their production processes more efficient on that basis.
For example, AI algorithms at Siemens’ Amberg plant use data from milling machines to tell when the machines’ spindles are reaching the end of their service lives and need to be replaced. That keeps unscheduled downtime to a minimum, saving costs of around €10,000 per machine each year.
And AI need not run exclusively on IoT platforms in the cloud. Thanks to higher-powered computers and higher-performance hardware, it can increasingly also operate in the factory hall itself – meaning right on the machine.
This technology is known as edge computing. Its advantage: intelligent applications can run on-site, with short transfer paths and almost real-time data processing. Besides that, data relevant to operations remain protected within the local environment – a connection to the cloud is needed only to update the AI applications.
Edge computing is already at work at Siemens’ Amberg plant, in quality control for circuit boards, for example. AI algorithms can tell from production data which circuit boards might be defective, so that only these identified components need to be inspected with X-rays. That has cut inspection costs by about 30%."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=107","Nov 27, 2019 12:05 PM","kenny chua","AI is also opening up entirely new possibilities for autonomous handling systems. To take just one example: it used to be necessary to engage in the time-consuming task of training robots with known objects, defining each movement and programming it in meticulous detail.
But AI enables handling systems to recognize even unknown objects, and to calculate the best gripping points for them. That capability finds its application in fully automated assembly lines for complex products like cars – lines that have to be as flexible as possible. To do that, robots must also be able to locate and move different components.
These future technologies are already a reality. But they still have far greater potential for making production more reliable, more efficient, and most importantly, more flexible. That’s the only way to meet the demand for increasingly customized products in small quantities, all the way down to lot size one – and what’s more, to do it quickly, with high quality, and at an attractive price.
Future success takes many actors working together
One thing is important in this context – future technologies always call for new paths in research and development. They can only be implemented successfully when companies of all sizes and in all industries work together, on an equal footing.
The key here is to combine digital and industrial expertise. Specific sectors have built up a deep knowledge of their industrial applications over decades, and that understanding is indispensable in applying digital solutions and artificial intelligence, edge computing and autonomous handling systems in industrial environments. What’s more, this complex topic calls for the skills of a very diverse range of actors from business, science and government.
Government must provide impetus for research, infrastructure, IT security, and education
It’s important to have the right regulatory impetus from government, in a coordinated form, across national borders. Four aspects are especially crucial here:
1. What’s needed is an ecosystem where innovations can grow – through support for application-related research and investments. That’s the only way future technologies can quickly be turned into usable products.
2. An area-wide IT infrastructure and fast internet access are basic requirements. Industry 4.0 needs, not just more bandwidth, but also very fast transfer times, combined with maximum availability. That’s indispensable for the future of industry. How should a small or medium-sized company, for example, get access to the digital future if its region does not have adequate access to the internet? This is where government needs to act.
3. IT security is essential to the success of Industry 4.0. Digitalization and cybersecurity have to go hand in hand. That’s why, early this year, Siemens and a number of partners developed what’s known as a Charter of Trust for cybersecurity. The aim is to establish general minimum standards for cybersecurity that are state of the art. At present, the Charter of Trust is supported by 16 companies and organizations."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=107","Nov 27, 2019 12:05 PM","kenny chua","4. All levels of education have to be reoriented to the new digital developments. Expanded skills in IT, software, programming, communications technology, IT security and data analysis will be indispensable for future industrial applications. That’s not something that can be procured overnight. We need to bring today’s and tomorrow’s employees along with us on this path to the future. This is the only way we’ll be able to take advantage of the vast opportunities that these future technologies have to offer.
Future technologies must fulfill a social purpose
Amid all this, technologies must never be considered purely in isolation. Of course they have to contribute to companies’ economic success. But they must also fulfill a social purpose, by contributing towards improving people’s lives.
Ultimately, people must always be the focus of attention. New technologies like artificial intelligence and edge computing can make people’s work less error-prone and create more room for creative tasks. But, contrary to an often-voiced opinion, they won’t replace people. Rather, these are simply technologies that will enable us to stay successful, especially in the B2B sector, and thus strengthen our business locations."

Buffett believes the most important quality for an investor is temperament, not intellect. A successful investor doesn't focus on being with or against the crowd.
The stock market will experience swings. But in good times and bad, Buffett stays focused on his goals, and so should we. This esteemed investor rarely changes his long-term investing strategy no matter what the market does.
""If the business does well, the stock eventually follows.""
""The Intelligent Investor"" by Benjamin Graham convinced Buffett that investing in a stock equates to owning a piece of the business. So when he searches for a stock to invest in, Buffett seeks out businesses that exhibit favorable long-term prospects. Does the company have a consistent operating history? Does it have a dominant business franchise? Is the business generating high and sustainable profit margins? If the company's share price is trading below expectations for its future growth, then it's a stock Buffett may want to own.
yes the future is in ir 4.0 industry! second and third wave is coming soon!"

Many people are afraid to lose money. They want to sleep soundly every night.
So am I. I am just as fearful as everyone else losing money. Therefore, let me recommend you
""PRESENTING ARBB (7181) THE GOOD STOCK FOR INVESTORS""
Why is ARBB (7181) GOOD?
These are my Reasons:
1) ARBB HAS ZERO GEARING
Current Liabilities/Non-Current Liabilities
Borrowings - ZERO
If a company has no borrowings or low borrowings can they go bankrupt if you don't owe money to bank, friends or financial institution?
Their cash in the bank is more than enough to cover all their liabilities.
No one or Company can be low in debt, SO ARBB IS A STOCK ON WHICH YOU CAN BUY AND SLEEP SOUNDLY.
2) HIGH NTA
I do not know why so many analysts or retailers start to use NTA as a valuation-base. I used to hear of PER being popularly used, perhaps ... P/B too. But NTA? Why every tom-dick now talking about the NTA of companies when we are trading/investing? Who started the NTA game? The NTA of ARBB is HIGH NTA value ... therefore, it is under-valued.
Price/NTA = 106.1%
3)ARBB IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK IR4.0 INDUSTRY
ARB is in the IR4. 0 industry where every developed or developing countries are heading to, its just a matter of time arb going SHOOT UP SKY HIGH! There are so much potential in IR4.0 industry company, The reasons why industry 4.0 is important are the benefits, BECAUSE It helps manufacturers with current challenges by becoming more flexible and making reacting to changes in the market easier. It can increase the speed of innovation and is very consumer centred, leading to faster design processes. Arb is ON the right track, so what are you waiting for? Until ARBB hit RM2.50, then only you regret??
PRICE FROM SEPTEMBER 0.305SEN RISE UP TO 0.40SEN
So WHY NOT BUY ARBB? GO AHEAD.
To me, I’m ALL in ready for the spike! Keep it as my retirement fund.

THE
INEVITABLE
TRANSFORMATION
The world is currently amidst a technological transformation that will fundamentally
change the way we live and work. It is difficult to predict precisely how this
transformation will impact different industries and countries. However, we know that
this transformation is unlike anything we have seen before due to the sheer pace and
breadth of these changes.
Many see these changes as an ushering of new era of growth, change and opportunity.
The ramification it brings for manufacturing firms is forcing nations and governments
to re-evaluate how the manufacturing industry operates and contributes to economic
growth. Nations are now increasing their focus on developing advanced manufacturing
capabilities by investing in high-tech infrastructure and quality education. These are
done by facilitating the transformation of the manufacturing industry to the next
technology frontier and raising their economic wellbeing.
The First Industrial Revolution started with the advent of steam and water power,
enabling mechanisation of production processes, while the Second Industrial
Revolution was driven by electric power and mass manufacturing techniques.
Information technology and automation brought in the Third Industrial Revolution. The
Fourth Industrial Revolution is exploding on the back of a range of technologies that
are blurring the distinction among physical, digital and biological spaces.
Industry 4.0 transforms how products are designed, fabricated, used and operated as
well as how they are maintained and serviced. It will also transform the operations,
processes, supply chain management and energy footprint of factories

DRIVEN BY
multiple factors
The manufacturing industry is increasingly shifting towards producing more
technologically-complex products.
It is no longer enough for the manufacturing industry to make better things - creating
innovative products and services that will meet customer needs - but also to make
things better - facilitating the design engineering, service planning and execution
as well as improving the management and production processes. Furthermore,
despite steady improvements in the manufacturing output and employment in the
sector, renewed investments will be needed to build the necessary infrastructure and
increase resources to support the continuous growth.
This emphasis on “making better things while making things better” is driven by the
following factors:
• Shifts in the global economic order - the rise of China, economic realignment
due to changes in the developed world, and the rise of fast-growth emerging
economies;
• Rate of technology advancement and its convergence - technological changes
driven by applications of these technologies in the manufacturing industry, such
as big data, the Internet of Things and cloud computing;
• Knowledge and skills for the future - retaining talent and producing future
workforce by taking advantage of the opportunities of this transformation;
• Global supply chain dynamics – increasing complexity in the supply chain
networks caused by distributed sourcing, engineering and production as
manufacturing firms now manage partners in a borderless world not bound by
geographical locations;
• Competitiveness of nations and firms - greater global competition as firms must
defend their domestic markets while simultaneously tapping into new market
segments for long-term growth;
• Increased regulations - environmental concerns and standards-based factors
like ISO compliance that apply across an increasingly interconnected world; and
• Changing customer behaviour – influenced by values,
personalisation and customisation, and the emergence of
new products and services attributes that are forcing firms
to reassess their manufacturing systems."

ADVANCEMENT
and Convergence of Technologies
At the heart of Industry 4.0 is a set of rapidly evolving
and converging technologies. These are pushing the
boundaries of what can be manufactured through
additive manufacturing and advanced materials. These
technologies are enabling richer insights through big
data analytics. They are blurring the lines between
physical and digital realms through rich simulations
and augmented reality. They are enhancing human
capacity through artificial intelligence and autonomous
robots. We are also seeing a shift in the way
information technology is being used through cloud
computing, system integration and the Internet of
Things (IoT). Last but not least, cybersecurity plays an
important role in ensuring information systems and
manufacturing lines are protected from cybercrime
threats.
Many of these technologies have been around or under
development for several years. However, the interaction
and resulting convergence of these technologies is
creating an unprecedented pace and breadth of
impact. Completely new industries may be created at
these intersections. Thus, these are loosely termed as
Industry 4.0 technologies. Given below is an overview
of these technologies and their impact on manufacturing.
By no means is this list exhaustive or definitive.

COMPETITIVE RESPONSE
by Nations & Lessons LearnT
Recognising the importance of the transformation of the manufacturing industry to their industrial future state, many countries
have launched Industry 4.0 related policies and programmes to support the research, development and deployment of Industry
4.0 technologies and processes at their local manufacturers.
We can draw the following lessons from the experiences of other countries
in charting the transformation to Industry 4.0 :
from America, England, German, France, Japan, Korea, China, Singapore
1.Set high aspirations: Setting right aspirations is critical to drive outcomes.
Policymakers should have clear, actionable, targeted and impactful objectives
for Industry 4.0 strategy. This helps bring the right attention and act as an
inspiration for the country
2.Ensure the right level of focus: With such ambitious nationwide programmes,
it is easy to get too narrowly focused on a few sub-sectors on one hand or being too
broad on the other. Balanced coverage of sectors and technologies is critical. At the policy
level, the focus should be on building an enabling environment to encourage innovation
and adoption in priority sectors.
3.Pay attention to enablers: Enablers such as infrastructure, funding, skills and
technology create a fertile ground to encourage innovation and kickstart a virtuous,
self-sustaining ecosystem. Policymakers need to tailor emphasis to the current
realities of their country
4.Include SMEs: Industry 4.0 technologies present both opportunities and risks for SMEs.
Thus, an inclusive programme is required to ensure that SMEs can make the
transformation to more advanced manufacturing processes or risk being left behind. More
importantly, Industry 4.0 provides an opportunity for the small companies of today to
become giants of tomorrow.
5.Provide access to funding: Availability of capital and incentives from the beginning
ensures that Industry 4.0 programmes have a solid start in the country. Funding and
incentives should be directed towards both R&D and adoption of these technologies in the
manufacturing process.
6.Implement from the top: Industry 4.0 is expected to have far reaching impact
across industries, societies and the broader economy. Thus, it is not a domain of any one
Government department or agency. Governance for such initiatives should be initiated at
the top most level in the country, with emphasis on strong cross-ministerial and agency
collaboration.
Several of the global and leading manufacturing countries have already embarked on their Industry 4.0 transformation and are in advanced stages of implementation, e.g.
Germany, the US, the UK, China and Republic of Korea. It is critical for Malaysia to learn from these experiences and move fast in its own Industry 4.0 adoption to not fall
behind in its global manufacturing position.

IMPORTANCE OF THE
Manufacturing Sector in Malaysia
The Malaysian manufacturing industry is an important economic sector contributing
about 22% to the GDP in the last five years. To date, its growth has had the effect
of stimulating jobs, attracting investments and creating business opportunities in
the downstream activities and related services sectors. The manufacturing sector
is expected to remain resilient and is on track to achieve the targeted annual GDP
growth rate of 5.1% under the 11th Malaysia Plan (RMK-11).
It is important to note that the sector is made up of a large number of SMEs, which
account for 98.5% of the manufacturing firms. Although most of these SMEs do
not have a strong global presence, many have the potential to be global exporters.
Together with other ongoing initiatives like the eCommerce Strategic Roadmap and
the Digital Free-Trade Zone (DFTZ), the Government is trying to provide the right
platform for SMEs to reinvent themselves and adopt the latest technologies to be
globally competitive.
On a global level, Malaysia has been enjoying a fairly strong and competitive
position in both manufacturing and the use of technology. The Global Manufacturing
Competitiveness Index 2016 (by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) ranked Malaysia at 17th
place among 40 countries. The report also projected Malaysia to climb four notches to
13th by 2020. On the technology and innovation side, the Global Innovation Index 2017
(by Cornell University, INSEAD and WIPO) ranked Malaysia at 37th globally among 127
countries and 8th in Asia. Further, the recent Readiness for the Future of Production
Report 2018 (by WEF and A.T. Kearney) highlights that Malaysia is well-positioned to
benefit from the future of Industry 4.0

Despite its strong current position, the state of the manufacturing industry has
been a case for concern in the last few years. Malaysia has moved away from
being an investment destination for low cost labour manufacturing activities and is
challenged by lower cost competitors from emerging economies and rapidly changing
technologies.
In line with the global trends outlined before, three major factors are impacting
the future of manufacturing in Malaysia, offering opportunities for growth, but also
challenging its competitive position:
• Global value chains and geographies of production are continuing to shift,
especially as China and other Northeast Asian countries are relocating production
to ASEAN. This is opening up new opportunities for Malaysia. However, Malaysia
will need to transform itself fast as other countries in the region are catching up.
• Quality of labour and higher productivity, and not low labour cost, will be
the new source of competitive advantage. Although Malaysia’s labour
productivity has grown at 3-4% over the last few years, its relative
global position and use of high-skilled labour have not moved forward.
Malaysia’s labour productivity was ranked only at 44th position in 2016, a
position that has remained unchanged since 2009. The relative share of
high-skilled labour declined from 19% in 2010 to 18% in 2017.
• New technologies are disrupting and fostering a technology-based model
of production. Barriers of adoption have come down with key Industry 4.0
technologies maturing and costs declining. Application of technologies to
improve efficiency and product quality is becoming the new normal, requiring
Malaysian manufacturing firms to innovate and invest in new technologies to
remain competitive.
CASE FOR ACTION
26 Industry4wrd : National Policy on Industry 4.0
As such, it is imperative for Malaysia to transform itself at an accelerated pace
and embrace Industry 4.0 as a critical cornerstone to propel and sustain its future
manufacturing competitiveness. Specific attention needs to be given to four
overarching goals:
• Drive continuous growth in manufacturing GDP;
• Increase national productivity;
• Create higher skill employment opportunities; and
• Raise innovation capabilities and competitiveness.
PROPELLING SMEs Forward
In Malaysia’s transformation, particular attention needs to be given to SMEs
as they account for the bulk of manufacturing companies (98.5%) and a
major part of employment (42%).
While most of the large manufacturing firms are already anticipating the
benefits and risks of adopting Industry 4.0 practices, Malaysian SMEs appear
to be cautious in taking the leap. Despite the enormous economic potential of
Industry 4.0, SMEs in the industry remain relatively unaware about it. There is a
risk that Malaysian SMEs might be left behind.
Industry 4.0 has the potential to transform manufacturing SMEs in multiple
ways: improving productivity, efficiency and cost; enhancing organisational,
management and production capabilities; enabling better quality and monitoring;
and developing innovators and producers of Industry 4.0 technologies.
The level of transformation required is, however, very substantial for SMEs. It will
not just be about adopting Industry 4.0 technologies, but also about changing
business processes and operating models. For example, SMEs will need to
collaborate and participate in broader production networks with other SMEs, large
firms or multinational corporations. Digitalisation of the manufacturing system will
be important to build direct links to end customers and produce innovative and
customised products.
Scale effects are also being redefined as SMEs are making headways in many
markets and outperforming larger corporations due to their agility and adaptability.

In Malaysia’s transformation, particular attention needs to be given to SMEs
as they account for the bulk of manufacturing companies (98.5%) and a
major part of employment (42%).
While most of the large manufacturing firms are already anticipating the
benefits and risks of adopting Industry 4.0 practices, Malaysian SMEs appear
to be cautious in taking the leap. Despite the enormous economic potential of
Industry 4.0, SMEs in the industry remain relatively unaware about it. There is a
risk that Malaysian SMEs might be left behind.
Industry 4.0 has the potential to transform manufacturing SMEs in multiple
ways: improving productivity, efficiency and cost; enhancing organisational,
management and production capabilities; enabling better quality and monitoring;
and developing innovators and producers of Industry 4.0 technologies.
The level of transformation required is, however, very substantial for SMEs. It will
not just be about adopting Industry 4.0 technologies, but also about changing
business processes and operating models. For example, SMEs will need to
collaborate and participate in broader production networks with other SMEs, large
firms or multinational corporations. Digitalisation of the manufacturing system will
be important to build direct links to end customers and produce innovative and
customised products.
Scale effects are also being redefined as SMEs are making headways in many
markets and outperforming larger corporations due to their agility and adaptability.
As such, manufacturing SMEs will need to learn how to deal with these disruptions, be
more resilient and embrace the change as an opportunity.
SMEs stand to gain the most from this Policy. The aim is to optimise the framework
conditions and support structures accordingly, so that manufacturing SMEs will be
able to meet the challenges of Industry 4.0 and take full advantage of the benefits and
opportunities it presents. HAVE A NICE DAY, CHEERS TO ALL ARBB FIGHTERS!"

Stated in the NEWSSSSS-----
PETALING JAYA: Malaysia is targeting to be an Industry 4.0 hub in South-East Asia to regain its status as an Asian Tiger.
Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said there was no choice but to be aggressive in adopting Industrial Revolution 4.0 in view of the accelerated speed in which new technologies evolved.
""With our National Policy on Industry 4.0 (Industry4WRD) launched last year, we aim at driving Malaysia towards becoming the Industry 4.0 hub in South-East Asia,"" he said.
He said this in his keynote address at the International Conference on Industry 4.0: A Global Revolution Towards Business, Technology and Productivity at Segi University Monday (Oct 14).
Dr Mahathir said digital transformation was expected to accelerate a sustainable future for Malaysia, as Industry 4.0 could lead to an increase in the GDP per capita following increased productivity and employment opportunities.
""Our Industry4WRD policy aims at increasing productivity in the manufacturing sector per person in Malaysia by 30% from RM106,647.
""This would elevate the absolute contribution of the manufacturing sector to our economy by 54% from RM254bil to RM392bil,"" he said.
Dr Mahathir said while new technologies could be disruptive, it also boast exciting prospects and challenges.
Following consolidation of Operation Technology and Information Technology (IT), data analytics, process understanding, and the ability to work with disruptive technologies, Industry 4.0 would transform the labour market into a skill-centric force.
Technologies such as the Internet of Things, Advanced Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and Additive Manufacturing are contributing factors to generate an increase in net productivity, he said.
""Hence, to make the adoption of Industry 4.0 a success, a sustainable approach has to be taken to ensure continuous growth of the economy.
""These transformations will not take effect unless we take the first step and our strategy has to be right.
""We need to take the Industry 4.0 transformation seriously. That way we can remain competitive and relevant in the international equation,"" he said.
Malaysia is poised to succeed, as it boast 40 years of experience in the manufacturing sector, apart from having created a good business ecosystem.
Malaysia could capitalise on its existing supply chain, access to the global market, and pool of talented multi-racial and multi- cultural community, said Dr Mahathir.
""For Malaysian businesses to remain competitive, they need to change their business strategy.
""We are sometimes too operational oriented to deliver results.
""Often, we are too conservative to venture into business diversifications and product development.
""This kind of business mentality and culture has to change,"" he said.
Dr Mahathir called on Malaysian businesses to seriously look into investing much more in Research and Development (R&D) to upgrade products and services, apart from improving business processes and embracing integrated technologies.
""We need to change our strategy from being technology traders and users to becoming technology creators,"" he said.
Dr Mahathir also called on universities to focus on developing their R&D capabilities in solving real industry problems.
He said that Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) should also be technology driven.
The Malaysian education system is currently being aligned to the economic needs of the nation, he noted.
""The focus on the teaching of industrial skills ought to be skewed towards innovative knowledge,"" he said.
There must be a push towards innovative thinking and multi-disciplinary knowledge, as Malaysia aimed to increase its high-skilled workforce from 18% to 35% by the year 2020.
SO TELL ME WHY DONT BUY AN UNDERVALUE FUTURE MAD GROWING STOCK? Even tun Mahathir says we are leading towards to the change.
more to come, second and third wave is closing in! be sure to ride with the wave!
CHEERS & HAVE A GREAT DAY EVERYONE!"

__________________________________________________________________________
After all the PA converted into mothershare; there will be total of 1.7 Billion share.
At price of RM1.50 per share, the market cap is 2.55 bil. That's between Penta Master (2 Billion and Vitrox (3.55Bil). Current market valuation is 95.5 mil, that's increased of 26 times. 2600%. That sounds quite a far fetched dream.
However, that dream is not impossible. Penta rose 22 times from 20sen to RM4.5 as of now. But it takes 3 years. At not within the year. And all the MOU translates into LOA making revenue per quarter is RM100mil per quarter with 20% ROE. Annualised EPS of 8sen; EPS 2sen per quarter and PE 20 only can give u RM1.50. Order book of 1.2Bil for next 3 years.
At the rate of dilution and , maintaining EPS 0.5 also a problem. I will consider if QR announce more LOA; NOT FROM BUDDY BUDDY COMPANY. (The only LOA they have now is from associated company Psiptek - that's more like cooking the book than doing legit business) Else it will be another Anzo scam. All trade receivables from buddy company jack the EPS up but never translate into cash generated from operation."

A key question is how ready Malaysia is for Industry 4.0. The recent report on the Readiness for the Future of Production Report 2018, jointly published by
the World Economic Forum (WEF) and A.T. Kearney, provides a global assessment of 100 countries and positions Malaysia in the “Leader” quadrant.
These are countries with a “strong current production base” and who are “positioned well for the future”. It is also interesting to note that Malaysia and China are the only two non-high income countries in the “Leader” quadrant.
This is both an enviable and a challenging position for Malaysia. On the one hand, it underscores Malaysia’s strong current manufacturing position and
its readiness for Industry 4.0. On the other hand, it also highlights the economic value at stake if
Malaysia is not able to transform itself in an accelerated
manner. The gap to global leaders like Japan, Republic of Korea, Germany, Switzerland and China is still significant and other countries in the region have
aggressive plans and are moving fast in their implementation"

WEF’s analysis identifies technology, human capital, global trade and networks, and institutional frameworks as key drivers of production for Industry 4.0.
Malaysia’s ranking in each of these drivers emphasises priorities in technology, human capital and institutional frameworks (21st to 30th position out of 100
countries), consistent with some of the challenges highlighted previously
Technology adoption and diffusion are particularly important for SMEs and underscore
the importance of creating production networks and collaborations with MNCs and large
companies.
Human capital focus is key to creating an accelerated shift in productivity, especially as
Malaysia has been relying on low labour cost in the past, with a declining share of
skilled labour.
Strengthening institutional frameworks underpins the role of Government in creating the
right ecosystem and facilitating collaborative platforms.
On global trade and investment, Malaysia is already well-integrated into regional value
chains and exhibits a very good trade infrastructure, which is reflected in its strong
global ranking (7th).

POLICY Objectives
Already, a number of initiatives and organisations have been established at
national, state and regional levels by both the Government and industry to develop
action plans to strengthen the manufacturing industry. This support for, and focus
on, manufacturing firms are important. However, these initiatives have largely
been developed independently and often have overlapping objectives and industry
audiences.
There is a need for a more streamlined and cohesive national agenda under which these
initiatives and organisations can be integrated to accelerate Malaysia’s transformation
into a smart and modern manufacturing system. This will also include the need for
a greater alignment across Government, research and academia regarding priority
industries, specific goals, enabling actions, and their funding. Countries like Germany
and Japan provide examples of best practices where Government, research and
academia are tightly integrated with the manufacturing industry through collaborative
public-private partnerships (PPPs) that develop innovative solutions for specific
industry needs.
With this in mind, Malaysia has put in place the National Policy on Industry 4.0 –
Industry4WRD – that provides a concerted and comprehensive transformation agenda
for the manufacturing sector and its related services

What exactly is big data?
To really understand big data, it’s helpful to have some historical background. Here is Gartner’s definition, circa 2001 (which is still the go-to definition): Big data is data that contains greater variety arriving in increasing volumes and with ever-higher velocity. This is known as the three Vs.
Put simply, big data is larger, more complex data sets, especially from new data sources. These data sets are so voluminous that traditional data processing software just can’t manage them. But these massive volumes of data can be used to address business problems you wouldn’t have been able to tackle before.
The Three Vs of Big Data
Volume The amount of data matters. With big data, you’ll have to process high volumes of low-density, unstructured data. This can be data of unknown value, such as Twitter data feeds, clickstreams on a webpage or a mobile app, or sensor-enabled equipment. For some organizations, this might be tens of terabytes of data. For others, it may be hundreds of petabytes.
Velocity Velocity is the fast rate at which data is received and (perhaps) acted on. Normally, the highest velocity of data streams directly into memory versus being written to disk. Some internet-enabled smart products operate in real time or near real time and will require real-time evaluation and action.
Variety Variety refers to the many types of data that are available. Traditional data types were structured and fit neatly in a relational database. With the rise of big data, data comes in new unstructured data types. Unstructured and semistructured data types, such as text, audio, and video, require additional preprocessing to derive meaning and support metadata."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=110","Dec 19, 2019 9:57 AM","alipay88","The History of Big Data
Although the concept of big data itself is relatively new, the origins of large data sets go back to the 1960s and '70s when the world of data was just getting started with the first data centers and the development of the relational database.
Around 2005, people began to realize just how much data users generated through Facebook, YouTube, and other online services. Hadoop (an open-source framework created specifically to store and analyze big data sets) was developed that same year. NoSQL also began to gain popularity during this time.
The development of open-source frameworks, such as Hadoop (and more recently, Spark) was essential for the growth of big data because they make big data easier to work with and cheaper to store. In the years since then, the volume of big data has skyrocketed. Users are still generating huge amounts of data—but it’s not just humans who are doing it.
With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), more objects and devices are connected to the internet, gathering data on customer usage patterns and product performance. The emergence of machine learning has produced still more data.
While big data has come far, its usefulness is only just beginning. Cloud computing has expanded big data possibilities even further. The cloud offers truly elastic scalability, where developers can simply spin up ad hoc clusters to test a subset of data.
Benefits of Big Data and Data Analytics:
Big data makes it possible for you to gain more complete answers because you have more information.
More complete answers mean more confidence in the data—which means a completely different approach to tackling problems.
Big Data Use Cases
Big data can help you address a range of business activities, from customer experience to analytics. Here are just a few. (More use cases can be found at Oracle Big Data Solutions.)
Product Development Companies like Netflix and Procter & Gamble use big data to anticipate customer demand. They build predictive models for new products and services by classifying key attributes of past and current products or services and modeling the relationship between those attributes and the commercial success of the offerings. In addition, P&G uses data and analytics from focus groups, social media, test markets, and early store rollouts to plan, produce, and launch new products.
Predictive Maintenance Factors that can predict mechanical failures may be deeply buried in structured data, such as the year, make, and model of equipment, as well as in unstructured data that covers millions of log entries, sensor data, error messages, and engine temperature. By analyzing these indications of potential issues before the problems happen, organizations can deploy maintenance more cost effectively and maximize parts and equipment uptime.
Customer Experience The race for customers is on. A clearer view of customer experience is more possible now than ever before. Big data enables you to gather data from social media, web visits, call logs, and other sources to improve the interaction experience and maximize the value delivered. Start delivering personalized offers, reduce customer churn, and handle issues proactively.
Fraud and Compliance When it comes to security, it’s not just a few rogue hackers—you’re up against entire expert teams. Security landscapes and compliance requirements are constantly evolving. Big data helps you identify patterns in data that indicate fraud and aggregate large volumes of information to make regulatory reporting much faster.
Machine Learning Machine learning is a hot topic right now. And data—specifically big data—is one of the reasons why. We are now able to teach machines instead of program them. The availability of big data to train machine learning models makes that possible.
Operational Efficiency Operational efficiency may not always make the news, but it’s an area in which big data is having the most impact. With big data, you can analyze and assess production, customer feedback and returns, and other factors to reduce outages and anticipate future demands. Big data can also be used to improve decision-making in line with current market demand.
Drive Innovation Big data can help you innovate by studying interdependencies among humans, institutions, entities, and process and then determining new ways to use those insights. Use data insights to improve decisions about financial and planning considerations. Examine trends and what customers want to deliver new products and services. Implement dynamic pricing. There are endless possibilities.
Big Data Challenges
While big data holds a lot of promise, it is not without its challenges.
First, big data is…big. Although new technologies have been developed for data storage, data volumes are doubling in size about every two years. Organizations still struggle to keep pace with their data and find ways to effectively store it."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=110","Dec 19, 2019 12:37 PM","alipay88","But it’s not enough to just store the data. Data must be used to be valuable and that depends on curation. Clean data, or data that’s relevant to the client and organized in a way that enables meaningful analysis, requires a lot of work. Data scientists spend 50 to 80 percent of their time curating and preparing data before it can actually be used.
Finally, big data technology is changing at a rapid pace. A few years ago, Apache Hadoop was the popular technology used to handle big data. Then Apache Spark was introduced in 2014. Today, a combination of the two frameworks appears to be the best approach. Keeping up with big data technology is an ongoing challenge."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=110","Dec 19, 2019 12:37 PM","alipay88","How Big Data Works
Big data gives you new insights that open up new opportunities and business models. Getting started involves three key actions:
1. Integrate
Big data brings together data from many disparate sources and applications. Traditional data integration mechanisms, such as ETL (extract, transform, and load) generally aren’t up to the task. It requires new strategies and technologies to analyze big data sets at terabyte, or even petabyte, scale.
During integration, you need to bring in the data, process it, and make sure it’s formatted and available in a form that your business analysts can get started with.
2. Manage
Big data requires storage. Your storage solution can be in the cloud, on premises, or both. You can store your data in any form you want and bring your desired processing requirements and necessary process engines to those data sets on an on-demand basis. Many people choose their storage solution according to where their data is currently residing. The cloud is gradually gaining popularity because it supports your current compute requirements and enables you to spin up resources as needed.
3. Analyze
Your investment in big data pays off when you analyze and act on your data. Get new clarity with a visual analysis of your varied data sets. Explore the data further to make new discoveries. Share your findings with others. Build data models with machine learning and artificial intelligence. Put your data to work.
Big Data Best Practices
To help you on your big data journey, we’ve put together some key best practices for you to keep in mind. Here are our guidelines for building a successful big data foundation.
Align Big Data with Specific Business Goals More extensive data sets enable you to make new discoveries. To that end, it is important to base new investments in skills, organization, or infrastructure with a strong business-driven context to guarantee ongoing project investments and funding. To determine if you are on the right track, ask how big data supports and enables your top business and IT priorities. Examples include understanding how to filter web logs to understand ecommerce behavior, deriving sentiment from social media and customer support interactions, and understanding statistical correlation methods and their relevance for customer, product, manufacturing, and engineering data.
Ease Skills Shortage with Standards and Governance One of the biggest obstacles to benefiting from your investment in big data is a skills shortage. You can mitigate this risk by ensuring that big data technologies, considerations, and decisions are added to your IT governance program. Standardizing your approach will allow you to manage costs and leverage resources. Organizations implementing big data solutions and strategies should assess their skill requirements early and often and should proactively identify any potential skill gaps. These can be addressed by training/cross-training existing resources, hiring new resources, and leveraging consulting firms.
Optimize Knowledge Transfer with a Center of Excellence Use a center of excellence approach to share knowledge, control oversight, and manage project communications. Whether big data is a new or expanding investment, the soft and hard costs can be shared across the enterprise. Leveraging this approach can help increase big data capabilities and overall information architecture maturity in a more structured and systematic way.
Top Payoff Is Aligning Unstructured with Structured Data
It is certainly valuable to analyze big data on its own. But you can bring even greater business insights by connecting and integrating low density big data with the structured data you are already using today.
Whether you are capturing customer, product, equipment, or environmental big data, the goal is to add more relevant data points to your core master and analytical summaries, leading to better conclusions. For example, there is a difference in distinguishing all customer sentiment from that of only your best customers. Which is why many see big data as an integral extension of their existing business intelligence capabilities, data warehousing platform, and information architecture.
Keep in mind that the big data analytical processes and models can be both human- and machine-based. Big data analytical capabilities include statistics, spatial analysis, semantics, interactive discovery, and visualization. Using analytical models, you can correlate different types and sources of data to make associations and meaningful discoveries.
Plan Your Discovery Lab for Performance
Discovering meaning in your data is not always straightforward. Sometimes we don’t even know what we’re looking for. That’s expected. Management and IT needs to support this “lack of direction” or “lack of clear requirement.”"

To accommodate the interactive exploration of data and the experimentation of statistical algorithms, you need high-performance work areas. Be sure that sandbox environments have the support they need—and are properly governed.
Align with the Cloud Operating Model Big data processes and users require access to a broad array of resources for both iterative experimentation and running production jobs. A big data solution includes all data realms including transactions, master data, reference data, and summarized data. Analytical sandboxes should be created on demand. Resource management is critical to ensure control of the entire data flow including pre- and post-processing, integration, in-database summarization, and analytical modeling. A well-planned private and public cloud provisioning and security strategy plays an integral role in supporting these changing requirements."

Buffett believes the most important quality for an investor is temperament, not intellect. A successful investor doesn't focus on being with or against the crowd.
The stock market will experience swings. But in good times and bad, Buffett stays focused on his goals, and so should we. This esteemed investor rarely changes his long-term investing strategy no matter what the market does.
""If the business does well, the stock eventually follows.""
""The Intelligent Investor"" by Benjamin Graham convinced Buffett that investing in a stock equates to owning a piece of the business. So when he searches for a stock to invest in, Buffett seeks out businesses that exhibit favorable long-term prospects. Does the company have a consistent operating history? Does it have a dominant business franchise? Is the business generating high and sustainable profit margins? If the company's share price is trading below expectations for its future growth, then it's a stock Buffett may want to own.

Industry 4.0 is the digital transformation of industrial markets; specifically the manufacturing industry. Industry 4.0 has evolved from an initiative to make the German manufacturing industry more competitive (‘Industrie 4.0’) to a globally adopted term referring to industrial transformation in discrete and process manufacturing, related with the vision and evolution of the smart factory.
Industry 4.0 is the evolution to cyber-physical systems, representing the fourth industrial revolution on the road to an end-to-end value chain with Industrial IoT and decentralized intelligence in manufacturing
Industry 4.0 is often used interchangeably with the notion of the fourth industrial revolution. This fourth industrial revolution is enabled by technologies that bring physical production and operations into a combined cyber-physical production environment.
In essence the technologies making Industry 4.0 possible leverage existing data and new data from assets that can now be connected with the Internet of Things (IoT; sometimes Industry 4.0 is also called Industrial IoT) in order to gain efficiencies on multiple levels, transform existing manufacturing processes, create end-to-end information streams across the value chain and realize new services and business models.
To understand Industry 4.0 it is essential to see the full value chain which includes suppliers and the origins of the materials and components needed for various forms of smart manufacturing, the end-to-end digital supply chain and the final destination of all manufacturing, regardless of the number of intermediary steps and players: the end customer.
Enabling more direct models of personalized production, servicing, as well as customer/consumer interaction (including gaining real-time data from actual product usage) and cutting the inefficiencies, irrelevance and costs of intermediaries in a digital supply chain model, where possible, are some goals of Industry 4.0 in this customer-centric sense of increasingly demanding customers who value speed, (cost) efficiencies and value-added innovative services."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=110","Dec 20, 2019 3:53 PM","THEREALDEAL","Data and optimization across the value chain: benefits and IT, OT and cyber-physical systems in ‘smart anything’
As you will discover in this guide Industry 4.0 is conceived as the next stage of organization and control in the full life cycle of the product value chain.
Industry 4.0 is a vision and journey. Organizations implement Industry 4.0 initiatives and prepare to turn the clearly document Industrie 4.0 vision, components, principles, technologies and architecture into reality, within their context
The cyber-physical systems are the basis and enable new capabilities in areas such as product design, prototyping and development, remote control, services and diagnosis, condition monitoring, pro-active and predictive maintenance, track and trace, structural health and systems health monitoring, planning, innovation capability, agility, real-time applications and more.
These latter capabilities also lead to the types of use cases and deployments as well as the benefits of industry 4.0 which we cover later and include personalization capabilities, real-time alerts and interventions, innovative service models, dynamic product improvement, increased productivity, higher up-time and, ultimately, new business models.
The new capabilities of Industry 4.0 lead to the ‘smart anything’ phenomena which often get most attention: from smart grid, smart energy and smart logistics to smart facilities, including smart buildings and smart plants, and smart services to the mentioned smart manufacturing, smart factories, smart cities and so on. The cyber-physical system, its components (e.g. intelligent control systems and embedded software systems) and its place in the evolution of manufacturing and industry (starting from mechanical systems) is explained in depth in this guide.
Industry 4.0 builds upon data models and data mapping across the mentioned end-to-end product life cyle and value stream. All the technologies in Industry 4.0 need to be seen in that perspective whereby integration is key.
A first integration (or convergence) is that of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT). Without IT and OT convergence there is no industrial transformation, let alone modern building management and several other areas where the silos between different traditional systems dissapear due to, among others, IoT on one hand and where IT and OT meet on the other, which is the case in close to all industries. The essence of IT and OT convergence revolves around data (and the systems where they have been sitting for many years), processes and people/teams. Again, the IoT is key here as also the Internet of Things starts with the capture (and subsequent analyses/leverage of data). It is safe to say that Industry 4.0 is only possible because of IoT.
Since the convergence of IT, OT and their backbones (such as networks and infrastructure, whereby we can also add CT or communication technologies) essentially boils down to an advanced and enhanced application of Internet, IT technologies and IT infrastructure impacted by IoT data (cloud infrastructure, server infrastructure, storage and edge infrastructure etc.) many see Industry 4.0 as a continuation of the third industrial revolution. On the other hand, the impact of ongoing automation in all organizations, including factories, has a clear impact on work and society. Yet, here as well it is argued that this is merely a result of the next steps in the third industrial revolution where automation already was intensive on many levels. Regardless of those discussions it’s clear that the fourth industrial revolution aspect of Industry 4.0 has won the debates."

Integrations in Industry 4.0: vertical and horizontal integration as all systems change
Further in this guide we will explore the two key integrations in the Industry 4.0 model. The first is vertical integration whereby all the systems in the traditional automation pyramid are affected: from field level and control level to production level, operations level and enterprise planning level.
Vertical integration will make the traditional automation pyramid view disappear. The same goes for several systems and applications across these various levels. Other systems such as ERP will dramatically change while still others will be replaced by rapidly emerging applications in the scope of Industrial IoT platforms, specifically manufacturing platforms and vertical platforms for various tasks and use cases in the many aspects of industry that get ever more features and become combined in an interoperable ‘systems of systems’ approach and by digital transformation platforms and business applications where IoT platforms and functionalities get integrated into.
The second is horizontal integration which is not about the hierarchical view of several systems as in vertical integration but about the mentioned end-to-end value chain: from supplier and the processes, information flows and IT systems in the product development and production stage to logistics, distribution and ultimately the customer. This too impacts the various systems employed in industrial markets and in the end is all about data and how, why and where it is used at the right time and right place for the right reasons to paraphrase the good old mantra of information management and business intelligence experts, with on top of course the good old DIKW model; from data to knowledge with the additional layer of action: decisions. And in Industry 4.0 that means human, semi-autonomous and autonomous (although it’s best to see it as a continuum)
An additional element that is key to mention in this quick introductory overview is indeed that of semi-autonomous and autonomous decisions, cornerstones in both Industry and Logistics 4.0, the essence of the self-organizing plant and autonomous production vision and, ultimately, the dream of as much automation as possible with IoT, artificial intelligence, the new integrated systems, advanced analytics and so forth all playing a role. It directly touches upon what we cover next: Industry 4.0, technologies and workers whereby the view is one of augmented capabilities, different skills, savings on human labor and so on, whereby the promise is one where workers with ‘obsolete jobs’ will find other work (emphasis ‘the promise’ as until now significant job losses have been the result of automation).
Industry 4.0: technologies, security, people/workers and society
Before diving into all the mentioned evolutions, integrations, cyber-physical evolutions, IoT elements, big data aspects and before looking at the origins of Industry 4.0, definitions, evolutions, global implications, similar initiatives, Industry 4.0 design principles, building blocks and the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 a final word on technologies and people to wrap up this quick introduction.
It is important to note that Industry 4.0 is not just about those technologies. It also looks at the impact on and role of society and workers (e.g. collaboration between man and machine as with collaborative robots or cobots, new required skillsets of workers in industries amidst all these changes and, inevitably, the loss of jobs due to ongoing automation as mentioned – and how to tackle this major challenge).
An increasing number of vertical industries is adopting the technologies, concept and principles of Industry 4.0.
Moreover, Industry 4.0 also has a strong focus on security. This does not just mean security of data and communication networks, data protection (including personal data protection, especially since the arrival of the General Data Protection Regulation, the ePrivacy Regulation and coming rules in several areas, including green facilities, energy and ecology, and again personal data in the wake of scandals that have emerged in consumer markets), cybersecurity in the broadest sense and industrial control systems security (ICS security) but also the protection and security of workers, industrial assets, critical infrastructure and ‘physical security’. As industrial assets and critical infrastructure (from critical power buildings to energy grids and more) get connectedand attacks are on the rise in the traditionally rather isolated industrial environments the stakes and dangers of vulnerabilities and attacks are huge in industry 4.0 which requires an end-to-end ‘security by design’ approach.
This overall security challenge and certainly the ICS security and end-to-end cybersecurity challenge ranks high among the Industry 4.0 challenges and riskF"

Industry 4.0 is the digital transformation of manufacturing, leveraging third platform technologies and innovation accelerators in the convergence of IT (Information Technology) and OT (Operational Technology) to realize connected factories and industry, smart decentralized and self-optimizing systems and the digital supply chain in the information-driven cyber-physical environment of the 4th industrial revolution (sometimes called 4IR).
Industry 4.0 also stands for the fourth industrial revolution as such. It is a new stage in the organization and control regarding the end-to-end value chain across the life cycle of products whereby increasing demand of customers for personalization is a driving force and flexibility, as-a-service models and the use of information technology go hand in hand with a move towards more autonomous decision making, a changing role for the workforce, new industrial organizational and collaborative paradigms and connected cyber-physical systems with security by design and turning data from various IT and OT systems into intelligence, decisions and new business models as leading principles.
The initial goals in Industry 4.0 typically are automation, (manufacturing) process improvement and productivity/production optimization; the more mature goals are innovation and the transition to new business models and revenue sources with information and services as cornerstones.
The original definition of Industry 4.0 (or better: Industrie 4.0)
The definition of Industrie 4.0 as proposed in 2011 was pretty lengthy. In a paper, entitled “Industrie 4.0 – Smart Manufacturing for the Future”, GTAI (Germany Trade and Invest) looked at the questions what is smart industry (a synonym of Industry 4.0) and what Industrie 4.0 means.
Industrie 4.0 - Smart Manufacturing for the Future by Germany Trade and Invest - an Industry 4.0 must-read - PDF opens
Industrie 4.0 – Smart Manufacturing for the Future by Germany Trade and Invest – an Industry 4.0 must-read (PDF opens)
An extract: Smart industry or “INDUSTRIE 4.0” refers to the technological evolution from embedded systems to cyber-physical systems…INDUSTRIE 4.0 represents the coming fourth industrial revolution on the way to an Internet of Things, Data and Services. Decentralized intelligence helps create intelligent object networking and independent process management, with the interaction of the real and virtual worlds representing a crucial new aspect of the manufacturing and production process”.
And it’s not done! More in the paper (PDF opens) and in our Industry 4.0 definitions list below.
What is Industry 4.0 (according to several sources)?
Obviously not all definitions of Industry 4.0 are the same. Industry 4.0 in practice means many things for many people and what some consider a definition of Industry 4.0, others won’t.
Industry 4.0 has been defined as “a name for the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies, including cyber-physical systems, the Internet of things, cloud computing and cognitive computing and creating the smart factory”. This Industry 4.0 definition is close to the original definition but not entirely correct or at the very least not correct anymore as Industry 4.0 goes beyond the factory, is also about more than automation and data exchange (e.g. the key role of workers, the key role of energy efficiency etc)."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=111","Dec 23, 2019 4:57 PM","kenny chua","Industry 4.0 and the fourth industrial revolution (4IR)
As a reminder the classic view of these four industrial revolutions, as Industry 4.0 became increasingly popular, was:
The first industrial revolution, which REALLY was a revolution, and, among others thanks to invention of steam machines, the usage of water and steam power and all sorts of other machines, would lead to the industrial transformation of society with trains, mechanization of manufacturing and loads of smog.
The second industrial revolution is typically seen as the period where electricity and new manufacturing ‘inventions’ which it enabled, such as the assembly line, led to the area of mass production and to some extent to automation.
The third industrial revolution had everything to do with the rise of computers, computer networks (WAN, LAN, MAN,…), the rise of robotics in manufacturing, connectivity and obviously the birth of the Internet, that big game changer in the ways information is handled and shared, and the evolutions to e-anything versions of previously brick and mortar environments only, with far more automation.
In the fourth industrial revolution we move from ‘just’ the Internet and the client-server model to ubiquitous mobility, the bridging of digital and physical environments (in manufacturing referred to as Cyber Physical Systems), the convergence of IT and OT, and all the previously mentioned technologies (Internet of Things, Big Data, cloud, etc.) with additional accelerators such as advanced robotics and AI/cognitive which enable Industry 4.0 with automation and optimization in entirely new ways that lead to ample opportunities to innovate and truly fully automate and bring the industry to the next level.
Some also like to add the injection of technology and connectivity in the human/digital mind and body convergence to Industry 4.0.
The injection of AI, hyper-connectedness and data analysis into how things, machines, communicate, act and lead to actionable insights with an omnipresence of the Internet of Everything in virtually each piece/machine of the Industry 4.0 dream is one thing, the convergence of man and machine (or technological extension) is still a bit further away and it’s so complex and will lead to so many more debates (also ethical) that it’s already called the fourth platform by IDC."

German industry can only be strong if its markets don’t end at the German border. This is one of the reasons why a functioning European Union is so important. Yet at the same time, a strong industrial sector also helps a stable Europe. How? Through investment, growth and jobs. To ensure this remains so in future, the BDI is committed to a pro-growth European policy.
A strong Europe needs a strong industrial sector to promote competitiveness, create jobs, and ensure a high quality of life. However, this strong Europe is beset by severe difficulties. The EU currently has to face a variety of challenges and at the same time defend itself against the growing group of Eurosceptics. Cohesion between the EU Member States is crumbling. The euro area crisis is not alone in having taken a heavy toll on the EU. And the possibility of British withdrawal jeopardizes the community itself. Moreover, the refugee crisis has shown how hard it is for Europe to preserve the principle of mutual solidarity. Yet without the EU, without open borders between the partners and without joint efforts, industry will also suffer – in all the Member States.
The European Union enables and simplifies the networking of knowledge and technology. For example, German industry collaborates across borders with companies and partners from other EU countries in order to manufacture competitively and to join forces in research and innovation. The internationality of industrial production also creates jobs and migration prospects which would no longer exist if Europe’s internal borders were no longer open. This would prolong production times, making services and products more expensive, and significantly harming the competitiveness of the industrial sector as a result. But it’s not just international cooperation and exports which are put at risk by the current situation. In some sectors, the entire production capacity of German industry hinges on free access to resources. Since not all these resources are available in Germany in sufficient quantity, free trade is essential for German industry to function.
As we can see, German industry needs a strong Europe, as this is the only way to create the structural environment necessary to ensure that innovation and competitiveness remain stable enough to compete with the other players on the world market. However, the EU is equally dependent on a strong industrial sector. Combating unemployment and climate change, and maintaining production in the EU are challenges which Europe cannot meet without a strong industrial sector.
To stabilize the situation in the EU and to set the course for the future, timely measures must be taken:
1. Maintaining open borders to preserve and strengthen the European Single Market
The free movement of workers and the Schengen Agreement were important steps towards a common Europe with a strong economy. It has become much easier for skilled workers from EU countries to offer their knowledge and skills in other Member States – from which the German economy has benefited in recent years. Furthermore, open borders allow trade to proceed rapidly. Speediness, an essential component of competitiveness in the era of globalization, is impossible to maintain if lengthy border controls impede the transfer of goods. This also applies to the cooperation connecting many European industrial companies and which will be a crucial growth engine in the coming years.
2. Optimizing and aligning infrastructure throughout the EU
The future will belong to those who can provide knowledge and innovation – and do so increasingly rapidly. To enable industry to exploit its potential in this sector, extremely active collaborations and joint projects have already been set up between companies from different EU countries, and businesses make use of the specializations of different European locations. However, the effectiveness of European production and knowledge networks is often limited by the lack of infrastructure investments and the differences in infrastructure from one country to the next. This concerns for instance transport routes and systems, the digital infrastructure, and energy generation and consumption.
3. Promoting focused immigration from third countries
The competitiveness and innovative capacity of industrial companies will in future depend on their employees’ expertise more than ever before. Given the demographic development in most EU countries, however, it is already evident that the skilled workers urgently needed will also have to be recruited from non-EU countries. A structural framework which allows these workers to immigrate into the EU as smoothly as possible must therefore be promptly and comprehensively promoted and developed."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=111","Dec 23, 2019 4:58 PM","kenny chua","4. Forging ahead with negotiations on international free trade agreements
German industry sets standards in the export of goods and services. Even so, international trade with many countries is still hampered by barriers such as high tariffs and lengthy import procedures. Removing these barriers is the object of a strong European foreign trade policy. It is therefore vitally important that the EU continues to make every effort to sign far-reaching free trade agreements with the world’s major nations.
5. Strengthening economic and monetary union
Internal trade within the European Union can only function if the EU continues to ensure stable economic and monetary union. Trading in a single currency is an enormous advantage for industry in the European Single Market. Only with a strong economic and fiscal policy focussing on structural reforms, balanced national budgets and investment can the European economy continue to compete on the world market."

If they haven’t heard of it, they’re likely to be skeptical of what they see as yet another piece of marketing hype, an empty catchphrase. And yet a closer look at what’s behind Industry 4.0 reveals some powerful emerging currents with strong potential to change the way factories work. It may be too much to say that it is another industrial revolution. But call it whatever you like; the fact is, Industry 4.0 is gathering force, and executives should carefully monitor the coming changes and develop strategies to take advantage of the new opportunities.
Coming to terms
Start with some definitions. We define Industry 4.0 as the next phase in the digitization of the manufacturing sector, driven by four disruptions: the astonishing rise in data volumes, computational power, and connectivity, especially new low-power wide-area networks; the emergence of analytics and business-intelligence capabilities; new forms of human-machine interaction such as touch interfaces and augmented-reality systems; and improvements in transferring digital instructions to the physical world, such as advanced robotics and 3-D printing. (The four trends are not the reason for the “4.0,” however. Rather, this is the fourth major upheaval in modern manufacturing, following the lean revolution of the 1970s, the outsourcing phenomenon of the 1990s, and the automation that took off in the 2000s.)
Most of these digital technologies have been brewing for some time. Some are not yet ready for application at scale. But many are now at a point where their greater reliability and lower cost are starting to make sense for industrial applications. However, companies are not consistently aware of the emerging technologies. We surveyed 300 manufacturing leaders in January 2015; only 48 percent of manufacturers consider themselves ready for Industry 4.0. Seventy-eight percent of suppliers say they are prepared.
Consider an example of each disruptive trend:
Big data. An African gold mine found ways to capture more data from its sensors. New data showed some unsuspected fluctuations in oxygen levels during leaching, a key process. Fixing this increased yield by 3.7 percent, worth up to $20 million annually.
Advanced analytics. Stronger analysis can dramatically improve product development. One automaker uses data from its online configurator together with purchasing data to identify options that customers are willing to pay a premium for. With this knowledge, it reduced the options on one model to just 13,000—three orders of magnitude fewer than its competitor, which offered 27,000,000. Development time and production costs fell dramatically; most companies can improve gross margin by 30 percent within 24 months.
Human-machine interfaces. Logistics company Knapp AG developed a picking technology using augmented reality. Pickers wear a headset that presents vital information on a see-through display, helping them locate items more quickly and precisely. And with both hands free, they can build stronger and more efficient pallets, with fragile items safeguarded. An integrated camera captures serial and lot ID numbers for real-time stock tracking. Error rates are down by 40 percent, among many other benefits.
Digital-to-physical transfer. Local Motors builds cars almost entirely through 3-D printing, with a design crowdsourced from an online community. It can build a new model from scratch in a year, far less than the industry average of six. Vauxhall and GM, among others, still bend a lot of metal, but also use 3-D printing and rapid prototyping to minimize their time to market.
These changes and many others like them are sure to be far reaching, affecting every corner of the factory and the supply chain. The pace of change, however, will likely be slower than what we’ve seen in the consumer sector, where equipment is changed frequently. The coming of steam power and the rise of robotics resulted in the outright replacement of 80 to 90 percent of industrial equipment. In coming years, we don’t expect anything like that kind of capital investment. Still, the executives surveyed estimate that 40 to 50 percent of today’s machines will need upgrading or replacement."

To capture the potential, manufacturers can consider three moves. Primarily, companies can gather more information and make better use of it. An oil-exploration company collected more than 30,000 pieces of data from each of its drilling rigs—yet 99 percent of that data was lost due to problems of data transmission, storage, and architecture. The tiny trickle of data it did capture was incredibly useful for managers. But so much more can be done. The executives we surveyed said that correcting these data inefficiencies should improve productivity by about 25 percent.
With production data now available for the asking, executives rightly wonder about how to begin. Which data would be most beneficial? Which data leakages are causing the most pain? Which technologies would deliver the biggest return on investment for a company, given its unique circumstances? To sort through the choices, manufacturing leaders can use a “digital compass” (exhibit). The compass consists of eight basic value drivers and 26 practical Industry 4.0 levers. Cross-functional discussions that will help companies find the levers that are best suited to solve their particular problems.
One kind of lost value that is sure to interest manufacturers is process effectiveness. Industry 4.0 offers new tools for smarter energy consumption, greater information storage in products and pallets (so-called intelligent lots), and real-time yield optimization. Swiss giant ABB used the latter in an Australian cement kiln. A computer-based system mimics the actions of an “ideal” operator, using real-time metrics to adjust kiln feed, fuel flow, and fan-damper position. The company found that the new tools boosted throughput by up to 5 percent.
The bigger picture
Strategists should also take Industry 4.0 into account as they contemplate the company’s future directions—the second way to capture the potential. The traditional manufacturing business model is changing, and new models are emerging; incumbents must be quick to recognize and react to these new competitive challenges. More specifically, executives must consider the following options—and watch for others that may be deploying them. Eighty-four percent of the manufacturing suppliers we surveyed expect new competitors to enter the market soon.
“Platforms,” in which products, services, and information can be exchanged via predefined streams. Think open-source software applied to the manufacturing context. For example, a company might provide technology to connect multiple parties and coordinate their interactions. SLM Solutions, a 3-D-printer manufacturer, and Atos, an IT services company, are currently running a pilot project to develop such a marketplace. Customers can submit their orders to a virtual broker platform run by Atos. Orders are then allocated to SLM’s decentralized network of production sites, and subsequently produced and shipped to the customer. Some companies are also trying to build an “ecosystem” of their own, as Nvidia has in its graphics-processor business. It provides software developers with resources, and offers start-ups help to build companies around Nvidia technologies.
Pay-by-use and subscription-based services, turning machinery from capex to opex for manufacturers. Rolls-Royce pioneered this approach in its jet-engine business; other manufacturers have followed suit.
Businesses that license intellectual property. Today, many manufacturing companies have deep expertise in their products and processes, but lack the expertise to generate value from their data. SAP offers consulting services that build on its software. Qualcomm makes more than half of its profits from intellectual-property royalties. Manufacturers might offer consulting services or other businesses that monetize the value of their expertise.
Businesses that monetize data. The SCiO, a Kickstarter project, is a low-cost, pocket-sized spectrometer that uses near-infrared technology to assess the composition of materials. It is expected to cost $250, whereas traditional machines cost upward of $10,000. Every time a SCiO is used, it contributes to a large database of scanned materials, helping to make the machine more accurate. To be sure, it is a consumer product, and not yet ready for industrial use. But industrial models are on the way. Kaggle, a distributed network of about 270,000 data scientists, has already helped more than 20 Fortune 500 companies solve their toughest data problems."

Manufacturers should begin today to join the hunt for the best digital talent, and think about how to structure their digital organization. Data management and cybersecurity will be critical problems to solve. Many companies will find that a “two speed” data architecture can help them deploy new technologies at the speed required, while also preserving mission-critical applications."

Have the courage to adopt IR4.0
MALL businesses are urged to have more courage to adopt the fourth industrial revolution (IR4.0) technologies to increase their productivity and remain competitive.
Entrepreneur Development Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Redzuan Yusof says Malaysian small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are still reluctant to adopt IR4.0 and this could hamper their opportunities to participate in the international arena.
“Their reluctance will lead them to lose out not only to successful economies but also developing economies.
“We need to wake them up or else, the core competencies that have been developed by our country, especially in IR4.0 such as in mechatronics, might migrate to other countries,” he says.
Mohd Redzuan was speaking to reporters after officiating the SME CEO Forum 2019 last week.
He says foreign direct investments (FDI) have made Malaysia a leading high-tech manufacturing hub in South-East Asia, with advancements brought into Malaysia by multinationals using foreign technologies.
Merely having access to the know-how, the human resources and the technology in this space will not suffice as local entrepreneurs must now become innovators in developing own solutions to stay ahead of the game, he says.
“We must take the reins and become leaders in our own right. We have the know-how, the human resources and technology in this field. We cannot sit idly and wait for foreign advances to reach our shores. Take the lead in the development of IR4.0 and become the envy of the world.
“As entrepreneurs, we must be courageous and creative and have just the right amount of candour to enable us to learn and unlearn in order to remain relevant, find our niche and compete with the rest of the world,” he says.
He notes that at this juncture, the country is losing its competitiveness to Vietnam, hence, the need to create more awareness among the SMEs to adopt IR4.0 technologies to remain competitive.
Mohd Redzuan says his ministry would also encourage SMEs to showcase their skills and core competencies as well as enhance the pool of resources for IR4.0 technologies to stimulate FDI and bring about quality investments.
This could also help in creating better employment opportunities for local workers as well as reducing the five million legal and illegal foreign workers in Malaysia, he adds. —THANKS FOR READING CHEERS!"

KUALA LUMPUR: The negative perception that Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) is a second choice for weak students compared to conventional academic field should be eliminated by parents, said Deputy Human Resources Minister, Datuk Mahfuz Omar (pix).
He said parents should place more confidence and support on their children taking TVET as this field is capable of producing the local manpower needed by the industry and nation to face Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR4.0).
“The government sees it (TVET) as a necessity. Those who hold diplomas in skills are eligible to continue their education at degree level through Universiti Teknikal Malaysia (MTUN) network project.
“The move is seen as giving confidence to the people in TVET,” he told a question and answer session at Dewan Rakyat here today.
Mahfuz was replying to a supplementary question by Datuk Seri Ismail Abd Muttalib (BN-Maran) on the statistics of TVET student intake which is still low compared to developed countries such as Germany, Holland and Australia and wanted to know what are the measures taken towards empowering the field.
To empower TVET, Mahfuz said via a 2025 plan under the National Skills Development Council which involved six ministries, his ministry is also focusing on TVET Tahfiz programme as the first step to extend skills training to young Tahfiz students.
“We want to ensure Tahfiz students also have a future to enter the employment sector,” he said.
Mahfuz said he had held a meeting with Kedah State Islamic Religious Council recently which was attended by 70 Tahfiz centre representatives to discuss the government’s plan for Tahfiz TVET"

The Fourth Industrial Revolution, also known as IR4.0 which is being embraced globally, is expected to change our lifestyles, jobs and the way we communicate. According to The World Economic Forum, about 65% of children in primary schools now may end up working in jobs that do not yet exist.
Jobs that have a high percentage of being phased out or automated include cashiers, receptionists, cooks, dispatchers, telemarketers and the list goes on. On the other hand, jobs that are least likely to be automated include occupational therapists, physicians and surgeons, first line supervisors of police and detectives, just to mention a few.
The emergence of online shopping alone has affected Malaysian household spending on goods from 33% in 1994 to a mere 26% in 2016. Conversely, household spending on services such as restaurants, transportation, hotel and health, increased to 22% in 2016 from 20% in 1994.
Evidently there is a change in preference, resulting in irrelevance of traditional production methods. In spite of this, there is still a large number of local firms which are unaware of the rapid automation of production processes.
Industry4WRD was launched by Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohammad on 31 October 2018 in an effort to help Malaysian manufacturers upgrade to be in line with IR4.0. It was expected to increase the productivity of manufacturers per person by 30%.
However as of August 2019, only 15 to 20 percent of local firms have made the migration. Despite the fact that there is a reserve of RM2billion in the 2018 budget, companies are clueless on how it could be accessed. Alarmingly, International Data Corporation, an industry research firm has revealed that Malaysia’s workforce is unprepared for IR4.0.
Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohammad was reportedly saying untapped talent exists in the country and an urgent response was needed for Malaysia to create, adopt, and integrate distinctive technological solutions to transform the workforce and industries.
Among solutions proposed, include one by Messe Worldwide Sdn Bhd sales director Foong Lai Lyn, that an agency be set up to manage the confusion faced by local firms and act as a point of support.
Meanwhile, Manokaran Mottain, chief economist at Alliance Bank Malaysia Bhd, points out that the government could benefit from providing additional support to small medium enterprises (SMEs) to upgrade and adopt IR4.0 technologies."

Government to provide RM20.7 billion in cash, incentives over 5 years for digitalisation
The government will provide RM20.7 billion worth of cash and non-cash incentives over five years from next year to assist Malaysian companies’ transition to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0). Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng announced this at the Pan Asian E-Commerce Alliance steering committee meeting in Cyberjaya today. Citing the Department of Statistics, Lim said the digital economy constituted 18.5 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018. He said the government’s efforts would push the share higher, with the International Data Corporation expecting it to reach 21 per cent by 2022. “The government is aiding the digitalising and future-proofing of the economy by investing heavily in digital infrastructure, reforming the broadband market, and encouraging small and large businesses to make the leap towards IR4.0,” he said. He added that the government would invest RM21.6 billion through Public-Private Partnerships from 2019 to 2023 under the National Fiberisation and Connectivity Plan, which will widen the coverage of high-quality, high-speed broadband Internet nationally while providing Malaysians with affordable services. “This will lay the groundwork for a comprehensive implementation of 5G in Malaysia, and gives the country a first-mover advantage in the era of Industry 4.0,” he added.
On the Malaysian economy, Lim said economic growth remains resilient despite the US-China trade dispute backlash and the projected world merchandise trade volume growth of only 1.2 per cent in 2019, instead of the 2.6 per cent increase forecast in April. He pointed out that Malaysia’s economic growth will be supported by development expenditure, for which the money not spent this year will be rolled over to next year. Lim said the Malaysian economy has performed more resiliently than others, registering a gross domestic product (GDP) of 4.9 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter of this year, which was faster than the 4.5 per cent growth in the previous quarter. For the whole of 2019, he said the government expects the GDP to expand at 4.7 per cent."

Industry Revolution 4·0 and Internet of
Things (lOT) have become subject of
much interest in recent years. Both are expected to gain momentum locally and internationally when they become part of the
core initiative of various government.
With the advent of the 4th global industrial revolution (IR), the government has
recognised the importance of integrating
the IR4.0 initiative into the national agenda
as a means to keep pace with the latest advancements. This article outlines some of the
issues that the author feels requires further
explanation. For example,· what exactly is IR
4.0? And, is itreally necessary to adopt JR4.0
when some traditional businesses are not
even intoIR3.0? Also, what are the likelyimplications of IR 4.0 on the country's economy? Finally, some recommendations are
forwarded to ensure that the Malaysian
economy is able to capitalise on the benefits
ofIR4.0.
So, what is JR 4.0? Ever since the first Industrial Revolution (IR) occurred, during
which steam power propelled industrial advancement, development came to be viewed
in terms of separate stages of industrial development that was primarily motivated by
the discovery of a new power source. Thus,
just as the first Industrial Revolution (IR 1.0)
was initiated by the creation of the steam engine, the secon.d and third I,Rs w~re set in
motion by the mvention of electnc powt;!r
and information technology (IT), respectively. JR 4.0, in the same way, is economic
and infrastructural advancement brought
about by the automation of human activities
through software. .
JR 4.0 involves the use of software (apps)
as a medium for automating business activity. It stimulates manufacturing productivity
by enhancing the connectivity between hu-·
mans and machines. In other words, apps
are a means of synchronizing the physical
and digital world ~o stimulate and innovate
industrial efficiency. It digitises, automates
and interconnects all the processes, not only
within a company, but along the entire value
chain. These inter-firm and customer datalinkages leads to the creation of holistic production network that generates and learns
.from 'big data' on manufacturing.
IR4.0 allows for the deployment oHOT in
a way that adds meaningful value through
synergistic and innovative gains in manufacturing proce!ises. Thus, it allows manufa.cturers to use data derived from physical cissets
within the production process, (machines
etc) to provide insights based on data. These
data-driven insights into efficiency and innovation are the key for the Malaysian industrial sector to remain globally
competitive.
JR 4.0 will make machine more intelligent where it gives manufacturers insights
tqey never had before. Automation process
is used in factory for the production in the
manufacturing sector. The used of automa- ,
tion in factory are called smart factory.
Is it necessary to adopt JR 4.o? Some traditional businesses are not even into IR 3.0.
Like it or not, IR4-('> is a change th~t is sweeping the global landscape. This is the current
trend of development and advancement,
and not adapting to these changes can only
. mean one thing, that we get left behind.
This does not mean that every single
business entity must embrace IR 4.0. Even
though, we are in IR 4.0, there might be
small companies exist who do not embrace
to current change. That might not be a problem since it involves a small supply of products or services for local demand.
Is JR 4.0 relevant to sectors otller than
manufacturing? It is my understanding that
JR 4.0 can benefit other sectors such as the
agriculture and services (education, tourism,
logistic). Examples of activities that reflect IR
4.0 include the development of smart universities, hospitals, factory, airports, sea
ports, the digitalization of accounting service, digitalization oflegal service and digitalization of human resource management
services. More specific examples include
fully automated production process.in factory, the process of loading or unloa~ing
containers at ports, robot waiters in restaurants, remotely managing the power of
buildings from smart phones or other devices.
Does it in olv~ significant costs? Any
structural change will involve some costs.
The initial set up of IR 4.0 will incur some
costs because of the deployment of an infrastructural framework that· facilitates JR 4.0,
as well as trans formative costs to adapt the
industry to utilise IOT.""However, in tl)e long
run it is reasonable to expect the efficiency
and innovation gains to significantly outweigh tlle deployment and transformation
costs."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=111","Dec 27, 2019 9:07 AM","THEREALDEAL","Will JR 4.0 benefit businesses of all sizes?
In general, I would say yes. JR4.0 will directly
affect medium and large corporations by
lowering their production costs because of
complete or partial changes in production
and operation activities. Such lower production costs are likely to trickle down to micro
and small enterprises translating into lower
production costs and·prices.
What are the macroeconomic-implications of JR 4.0 on Malaysia? Efficiency gains
confer cost benefits, which translates into
more competitive pricing of Malaysian
products (and exports). More competitively
priced exports have the potential to b09st
export volume, and stimulate the Malaysian
economy. In other words, JR 4.0 improves
the competitiveness of Malaysian exports,
thereby raising its Gross Domestic Product
(GOP). A higher GOP translates into more income which may further boost the industrial
sector and potentially employment. .
When at least large corporations can
lower cost of production as well as opera tion
cost due to IR4.0, price of goods and services
to be sold might be lower. As a result, it has
the potential to make Malaysian products
more competitive. This happen if Malaysia
adapt to changes fast and benefiting from
first/early mover advantage.
On the oilier hand, it may be argued that .
increased automation implies iliat employment opportunities may be reduced for
highly manual jobs involving repetitive
tasks. There is a potential that some will be
out of job due to this wave as robots are taking human role for some activities. However,
this is not expected to occur across all jobs,
SO.me large scale factories are already automated. The real benefit ofJR4.0 lies in access
to and learning from big data. These are
likely t9 create new dimen~ions of employ-
'ment, tOQ.
What are my recommendations to ensure that ilie Malaysian economy can benefit
from JR 4.0? Firstly, studies must be conducted in order to identify which sectors
have the most potential to benefit from IR
4.0. These sectors must be given more prior- ,
ity, when shifting to JR 4.0. This way, the
t:ransformative and deployment costs oflR
4.0 can be mitigated early on. This approach
is also a good way of determining which activities are more suitable for automation,
and ilie sectors that are not.
Secondly, creating awareness of JR 4.0
and stakeholdCf'rs engagement is necessary.
Many are still not fully aware of ilie importance and benefits ofJR4.0. We need to prepare our workforce in areas such as additive
manufacturing, so iliat ilie transition to the
new system is a smooth one, with minimal
resistance.
Thirdly, there is a need to minimise the
cost of transition to JR4.0. Incentives should
be provided to companies that are willing to
transform. This not only has the benefit of
reducihg ilie cost of transformation, but also
has the advantage of increasing the rate of
transition to IR4.0.
There is also a need to minimise ilie social
costs of shifting to 4.0. For example, to address possible unemployment issues arising
from automation, the government must
provide training programs and! or provide
alternative forms of employment.
Finally, it is imperative that ilie necessary
infrastructure is ready and available to meet
the requirements for transition to lR4.0. For
example, internet services have to be furtller
improved nationwide in terms of coverage
and speed. This is necessary to fully capitalise
on rOT and big data. Wiiliout ilie necessary
infrastructure, the benefits of JR 4.0 will not
manifest."

Industry 4.0 is a big deal for Malaysia. It is one of the highly anticipated ‘visions’ for Malaysia since the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) launched in 1996.
When the Industry 4.0 national policy was launched last year, and one year later at MYINDUSTRIES 2019, Tun M had stated emphatically there has to be a single, directed emphasis to rejuvenate IR 4.0.
Yes, this is a rejuvenation of our efforts. Malaysia is not starting from scratch.
This rejuvenation refers to the manufacturing skills and expertise that Malaysia has earned for itself the past 40 years.
Industry 4.0 is the next stage, where the industry takes stock of how far we have come, and how much further we need to go to achieve the across-the-board efficiencies touted to come with Industry 4.0.
Some may take this to mean Malaysia has to build flying cars to be seen as truly at the next-level. Others may see it as a direct replication of what Germany is doing with their factories, and so on and so forth.
I’ve discovered IR4.0 technologies isn’t just for manufacturing, but for services sectors and is even applicable in banking and health care.
What does this mean?
IDC had even described IR4.0 as third platform technologies like cloud computing, and information / analytics (big data), and possibly the Internet of Things. Some of the technologies are used in business organisations, and not just in manufacturing.
Whatever Industry 4.0 eventually turns out to be for Malaysia, this is about more than just keeping up appearances.
FUNDING
IR 4.0 is going to be expensive.
When the national policy was announced last year, the ministry responsible for driving it, Ministry of International trade and Industry (MITI), announced they were identifying SMEs to be placed under a IR4.0 readiness assessment programme.
According to MITI also, RM210 million was allocated under the programme to encourage transition of businesses to Industry 4.0 technology from 2019 till 2021.
One of its agencies, MIDA or the Malaysian Investment Development Authority, is one of, if not the, main driver for this readiness programme.
In this video, a MIDA rep actually goes through the financing options under the 2019 budget."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=111","Dec 31, 2019 9:03 AM","THEREALDEAL","WHAT DOES ALL OF THIS MEAN?
In a report by The Star earlier this year, Ministry deputy secretary-general (trade) Datuk Seri Norazman Ayob had said, “The ministry had targeted to assist 500 SMEs to undergo the assessment by the end of the year, and support 60 of them by providing a 70:30 matching grant of up to RM500,000 for each firm.”
After the recent 2020 budget announcement, the industry may expect funding efforts to ramp up.
Top Glove, is a popular example of a manufacturing organisation which has successfully embarked upon an Industry 4.0 transformation. This was a journey they undertook in earnest in 2017, however.
This journey comprised of implementing and applying technologies like Internet of Things, robotics and an automated real-time manufacturing system.
Today, it is one of the world’s largest manufacturer of gloves, with 40 factories in three countries, 648 glove production lines and capacity of 60.5 billion pieces of gloves produced, every year.
Malaysia may have many more manufacturers with Top Glove’s potential to successfully deployed IR4.0 technologies and reap benefits from it.
But, they should take the first crucial step of assessing their readiness, to be able to better strategies their next steps moving forward. MIDA offers this, and also funds companies that undergo their readiness assessment programme."

Technology sector
Maintain neutral: We attended the International Conference on Industry 4.0 (IR4.0) held by SEGi University on IR4.0 enablers, such as simulation, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and big data analytics, as well as the blockchain technology.
We came away with a few key takeaways. Among the key challenges of implementing IR4.0 shared by the speakers are: i) a lack of skills and resources (no “deep pockets”) with the use of autonomous robots and smart manufacturing at only 7.4%; ii) risk management and compliance concerns (such as those regarding cybersecurity and data protection); iii) finding the right technology partners; and iv) enduring executive support and leadership.
There will be income tax exemption for 70% to 100% of statutory income for five to 10 years. Unabsorbed capital allowances and accumulated losses incurred during the pioneer period can be carried forward and deducted from post-pioneer status of a company.
Furthermore, there will be an allowance of 60% to 100% of qualifying capital expenditure (capex) (factories, plants, machinery or other equipment used in an approved project) incurred within five to 10 years from the date the first qualifying capex is incurred.
There will be an expansion of the Automation Capital Allowance (ACA) to cover the service sectors for the first RM2 million and an extension of the existing ACA until 2023.
Several presenters also stressed the importance of authenticity in the medical space. With more than 250,000 children suffering from the consequences of counterfeit drugs each year, there is increasing demand for a decentralised data recording ledger that is immutable to ensure that the data provided by the entire supply chain of medicine is dependable. Non-fungible tokens serve as an excellent solution in this case as patients would be able to track the data of a specific pack of medicine before consuming it.
The application of the blockchain technology is still in its infancy and often faces scrutiny from regulators as we currently see in the case of N2N Connect Bhd’s rocky journey in developing a blockchain-enabled exchange. However, we are positive that Budget 2020 has allocated RM25 million for digital application pioneer projects, including the blockchain technology. With developers and regulators working hand in hand, we believe the adoption of the blockchain technology can improve the economy and social welfare by amplifying the technology’s main reason for existing — to promote transparency.
Although challenges exist, we note that the newly launched Shared Prosperity Vision 2030 is also in line with efforts to ensure that the requirements of IR4.0 are met through upskilling of labour with the creation of higher-value-added jobs in manufacturing and services through technology and automation."

The answer is due to future profits from ecrl, bandar Malaysia which will increase steel usage
Also why people rush and chased up Tdm, rsawit and Jtiasa by 150% to 200% price rise? When their next quarter results will still be horrible?

The history of Industry 4.0 tracks the manufacturing industry from the industrial revolution to the digital transformation and beyond.
Each new stage represents a revolution in the manufacturing process that has changed the way we think about and work in the industry.
Industry 1.0
Dating back to around 1760, the First Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes using water and steam. It was hugely beneficial in terms of manufacturing a larger number of various goods and creating a better standard of living for some. The textile industry, in particular, was transformed by industrialization, as was transportation.
Fuel sources like steam and coal made machine use more feasible, and the idea of manufacturing with machines quickly spread. Machines allowed faster and easier production, and they made all kinds of new innovations and technologies possible as well.
Industry 2.0
The first Industrial Revolution represented the period between the 1760s and around 1840. This is where the second industrial revolution picked up. Historians sometimes refer to this as “The Technological Revolution” occurring mainly in Britain, Germany and America.
During this time, new technological systems were introduced, most notably superior electrical technology which allowed for even greater production and more sophisticated machines.
Industry 3.0
It began with the first computer era. These early computers were often very simple, unwieldy and incredibly large relative to the computing power they were able to provide, but they laid the groundwork for a world today that one is hard-pressed to imagine without computer technology.
Around 1970 the Third Industrial Revolution involved the use of electronics and IT (Information Technology) to further automation in production. Manufacturing and automation advanced considerably thanks to Internet access, connectivity and renewable energy.
Industry 3.0 introduced more automated systems onto the assembly line to perform human tasks, i.e. using Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC). Although automated systems were in place, they still relied on human input and intervention."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=112","Jan 7, 2020 9:10 AM","Elaine Tan","Industry 4.0
The Fourth industrial Revolution is the era of smart machines, storage systems and production facilities that can autonomously exchange information, trigger actions and control each other without human intervention.
This exchange of information is made possible with the Industrial Internet of things (IIoT) as we know it today. Key elements of Industry 4.0 include:
Cyber-physical system — a mechanical device that is run by computer-based algorithms.
The Internet of things (IoT) — interconnected networks of machine devices and vehicles embedded with computerized sensing, scanning and monitoring capabilities.
Cloud computing — offsite network hosting and data backup.
Cognitive computing — technological platforms that employ artificial intelligence.
“Industry 4.0 starts to move towards Industry 5.0 when you begin to allow customers to customize what they want
Industry 4.0
What Is Industry 5.0?
Less than a decade has passed since talk of Industry 4.0 first surfaced in manufacturing circles, yet visionaries are already forecasting the next revolution — Industry 5.0. If the current revolution emphasizes the transformation of factories into IoT-enabled smart facilities that utilize cognitive computing and interconnect via cloud servers, Industry 5.0 is set to focus on the return of human hands and minds into the industrial framework.
Industry 5.0 is the revolution in which man and machine reconcile and find ways to work together to improve the means and efficiency of production. Funny enough, the fifth revolution could already be underway among the companies that are just now adopting the principles of Industry 4.0. Even when manufacturers start using advanced technologies, they are not instantly firing vast swaths of their workforce and becoming entirely computerized.
“With Industry 5.0, you’ll be able to automate the manufacturing process better, which means you’ll have real-time data coming in from the field
Conclusion
As technological innovations become ever more rapid, revolutions could ultimately follow one another in quick succession over the next 10 years and beyond. Whereas the first three industrial revolutions took decades to play out, today’s revolutions last only as long as it takes for industry-wide implementation to complete itself. It’s important to note that Manufacturing 5.0 is an upgrade of 4.0 and not entirely new.
Overall, the development of Industry 5.0 could prove to be the full realization of what the architects of Industry 4.0 had only dreamed of at the dawn of the 2010s. As artificial intelligence improves and factory robots assume more human-like capabilities, the interaction between computers, robots and human workers will ultimately become more meaningful and mutually enlightening."

Abstract—Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR4.0) is the current key term today that affects various facets of humans’ life. As society struggles to grasp its impact, academics are responsible to prepare the future workers, who must be able to cope with IR4.0 and beyond. This paper attempts to gauge students’ perceptions of blended learning. At the same time, the author wants to investigate whether they perceive blended learning as a platform to help them face IR4.0 after graduation. A class taught by the author was observed for two semesters, and at the end of the second semester, all students in the class were asked five main questions on blended learning and their readiness to face IR4.0. Preliminary findings suggest that, firstly, students were not exactly comfortable learning in a blended learning environment and with flipped classroom as one of its strategies. Secondly, the majority of the respondents were unsure of what IR4.0 is, and yet they were confident that they would be able to face IR4.0. The author argues that much is still needed to be done in order to embrace IR4.0, despite the abundance of preparation to face it at various levels."

The Nine Pillars of Industry 4.0
While the First Industrial Revolution was ushered in by steam, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is being fueled by digital transformation. With an increased adoption of technologies such as cloud computing, augmented reality (AR), and the Internet of Things (IoT), the world of manufacturing is rapidly changing.
As more smart technologies are implemented into manufacturing systems and processes, there is room for enormous potential. Connected machines will interact, visualize the production chain, and make decisions automatically and autonomously.
There are nine main pillars of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, also referred to as Industry 4.0. These pillars outline the new technology manufacturers are using to improve all areas of production processes. Whether you work in the manufacturing industry or not, it is imperative to familiarize yourself with these pillars, as they are expected to have a widespread impact across all industries and society as a whole.
1. The Internet of Things
The Internet of Things refers to the networking and connectivity of smart devices. When you think of IoT, devices such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops are usually top of mind. However, also think of wearables, cars, and any machine or device that allows the transmission of data, even our refrigerators.
In the world of manufacturing, this technology is often referred to as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Manufacturers are attaching sensors to machines and other physical assets on the plant floor to collect data which influences decisions real time and leads to increased efficiency and productivity.
2. Augmented Reality
Augmented reality (AR) displays digital content in the real word through a device, such as a mobile phone or special eyeglasses. There are a number of different uses for this technology in the manufacturing industry, such as:
Safety Training: New hires are often unfamiliar with the protocols, equipment, and procedures on the plant floor. In order to prevent safety instances, it’s vital to provide inexperienced personnel with training as soon, and as often, as possible. With the use of AR, they can receive text overlays and other digital information to help them understand what is happening on the floor without requiring additional resources or production stops.
Streamlined Logistics: In fulfillment centers and warehouses, manual checks are required for most orders and shipments. With AR, this process becomes automated reducing errors, saving time, money and resources.
Maintenance: Maintenance crews save time and eliminate guesswork by using AR devices to provide information about equipment, such as, preventative maintenance schedules, potential issues, and the service history of the machine.
3. Simulation
Simulations leverage real-time data to reflect the physical world of product development and production processes in a virtual environment. These models can be used to run more efficient tests so settings and processes are optimized before production even starts, reducing downtime and improving quality.
4. Additive Manufacturing
While manufacturers are looking to expand the use of additive manufacturing in their processes, technologies like 3D printing are already playing an important role in three key areas:
Design: Design teams can experiment with creating more complex geometric shapes and structures due to the flexibility of 3D printing technology.
Prototyping: 3D printing is often used for prototyping, accelerating design cycles and reducing costs. Companies are free to fail fast in a controlled environment and explore multiple models before deciding on final designs.
Low-Volume Production: When only a small amount of a product is needed, 3D printing is the fastest and most economical production method.
5. System Integration
Industry 4.0 is all about improving connectivity – and not just between machines. Many manufacturing information systems are currently not fully integrated. With improved system integration, companies can become more interconnected both externally and internally. This will result in an agile manufacturing environment allowing real time production corrections and quick pivots.

6. Cloud Computing
As the use of technology and data sharing at manufacturing companies grows, cloud computing provides scaleable storage and increased computing power. The cloud also improves data accessibility and integrity, helping to eliminate data silos."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=113","Jan 8, 2020 9:42 AM","Elaine Tan","7. Autonomous Systems
While the manufacturing industry has made great strides when it comes to automation over the last few years, there is still a lot of untapped opportunity. Collaborative robots are designed to fill the gaps between traditional robots and human workers and open up new areas for automation. These robots are designed to work in ways similar to humans, with the added ability to monitor and transmit data.
8. Cybersecurity
As connectivity increases, the risk of a potential cyberattack grows alongside it. Any security breach could damage multiple areas of the business, from supply chain to operations. It’s absolutely critical that companies prepare and protect their information systems and production lines from cyberthreats.
9. Big Data Analytics
The common theme among all of these pillars and new technologies is data collection and analysis. There are massive amounts of untapped data in the manufacturing industry, and we are just beginning to scratch the surface.
Industry 4.0 experts have encouraged manufacturing companies to invest not only in the technical infrastructure but also talent. Every company is now a digital company and in order to not only survive but thrive, the need for people with advanced data analysis skills is critical. Analysis needs to scale across all parts of the business from HR, sales, marketing to the manufacturing floor. Data is disruptive, no one can accurately forecast where the next “big idea” will emerge and how it will change our lives. What will push us into the 5th Industrial Revolution?
It’s important for manufacturers to have tools, such as dashboards, to help them clean, organize, and visualize the massive amount of data available. In the end, this will free up time to analyze data, communicate insights, and optimize inefficient processes."

Ready to take on IR4.0
APU is equipped with world-class infrastructures that allow students to gain hands-on experience, and exposure to real-time data and scenarios – to emerge as competent technology professionals under a real-world environment.
AS we cross the threshold of a brand new year, we are hurtling fast towards a future that increasingly resembles those depicted in sci-fi movies, with worlds that are increasingly enriched with integrated advanced technology in everyday lives.
Already many of these imagined technologies have already made headway within this decade – cars today are equipped with sensors that assist in driving and we have access to vast amounts of data, right on hand-held devices.
An accumulation of an ongoing tide of industrial revolutions going back to the invention of steam machinery in 18th century Britain, today’s Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR4.0) is “blurring the distinction among physical, digital and biological spaces, ” as mentioned in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry’s (MITI) national policy called “Industry4WRD”.
The new revolution is set to change how products will be designed, made, used and operated. Maintaining and servicing these new products will also evolve, affecting how operations, processes, supply chain management and energy footprints in factories are utilised.
Nine Strong Pillars
Most industries worldwide look to the Boston Consulting Group’s (BCG) delineation of nine areas that will be affected by IR4.0. These include the processing of big data, the further advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, increasing use of simulations.
Aided by use of cloud technology, technology will be more horizontally and vertically integrated, enabling Internet of Things (IoT), additive manufacturing, integration of augmented reality and cyber security to police against abuse.
While sweeping changes transform industries worldwide, IR4.0 should ultimately be instilled in those who will be affected – the country’s future crop of graduates coming out of the various academic institutions.
Ready for the future
At the forefront of this new wave, is one of Malaysia’s premier private universities, Asia Pacific University of Technology & Innovation (APU). It concentrates on providing a unique fusion of technology, innovation and creativity in preparing graduates for significant roles in business and society globally.
APU innovates by reviewing, developing and delivering programmes that are versatile, current and future-proof. By aligning its framework according to the Nine Pillars, it prepares its students for the impending revolution, through programmes that pivot on technology.
The framework covers IoT, data science, cyber security, cloud computing, AI or intelligent systems, mechatronics, e-business, digital marketing, financial technology (fintech) and mobile technology.
The university also observes the policies outlined in MITI’s Industry4WRD. These key areas are also developed to address the need for talents to transform Malaysia’s Digital Economy. The Industry4WRD policies focus on developing and implementing the right technological infrastructure to allow industries to undergo seamless digital transformation processes.
As an education institution, teaching and learning infrastructure and facilities within APU provide students a comfortable ecosystem for development, where they also receive instruction on the Nine Pillars.
The university is equipped with world-class infrastructures from France, Singapore, Germany, the United Kingdom, among others that allow students to gain hands-on experience, and exposure to real-time data and scenarios – to emerge as competent technology professionals under a real-world environment.
Once such facility at APU is the Cyber Security Talent Zone (CSTZ), which is also Malaysia’s first integrated cyber security talent zone. It houses a military-grade real-time cyber security monitoring software at the full-fledged Cyber Threats Simulation and Response Centre and Security Operations Centre, where students gain real-life exposure and practical experience.
APU nurtures creativity and innovation through its discussion spaces, think tanks, incubation zones and Innovation Labs on its Technology Park Malaysia (TPM), Bukit Jalil campus – which provides an out-of-classroom environment for students.
While its research centres provide students fruits for thought in robotics engineering, IoT, data analytics, forensic and cyber security, business digitisation and innovation, entrepreneurship and leadership.
APU also provides professional transformation by providing platforms for students to formulate world-changing ideas and develop innovative solutions for complex problems faced by industries undergoing digital transformation."

One crucial element that can never be replaced by increased mechanisation is of course the human touch. This takes the form of soft skills that are always welcomed by customers in any industry, and hence are qualities that employers look out for.
Students who graduate with this added potential are deemed industry-ready by most employers as they leave their academic institutions. In fact, surveys show that employers value these soft skills, which include communication skills, problem-solving skills, openness to learn and to gain new knowledge.
Such qualities are inculcated at APU for these skills are constantly nurtured on a day-to-day basis.
In addition, the university’s campus environment is home to international students from over 120 countries, offering local students the chance to mingle with a global community.
This is important as events such as the celebration of various countries’ independence days, multicultural nights and other cultural celebrations help instill a global outlook in APU students, encouraging understanding and respect for other nationalities and moulding them as effective communicators in tomorrow’s global economy.
IR4.0 adoption and development also calls for deeper critical-thinking skills. So to complement its world-class facilities, APU developed innovative teaching and learning methods that produce graduates who can think critically, act innovatively and communicate ideas effectively.
APU nurtures creativity and innovation while encouraging cross-cultural communication, allowing students to be equipped with the necessary technical and soft skills to be highly employable.
Such international exposures ensure APU graduates are open to differences in opinions, and they are also well-trained to engage in global conversations, international strategies, and multicultural encounters. In essence, they become confident and are highly employable.
All APU students also go through industry-advised, strategically designed curriculums that stress on innovation and advanced digital technologies and automation, readying them for complex, dialectical opportunities once they graduate.
To ensure its graduates are professional and highly employable, APU builds students’ confidence through practical workplace skills within the curriculum. Eventually, once they graduate, they are workplace-ready – a fact that is demonstrated by its students who are professionally attired, even on-campus.

Buffett believes the most important quality for an investor is temperament, not intellect. A successful investor doesn't focus on being with or against the crowd.
The stock market will experience swings. But in good times and bad, Buffett stays focused on his goals, and so should we. This esteemed investor rarely changes his long-term investing strategy no matter what the market does.
""If the business does well, the stock eventually follows.""
""The Intelligent Investor"" by Benjamin Graham convinced Buffett that investing in a stock equates to owning a piece of the business. So when he searches for a stock to invest in, Buffett seeks out businesses that exhibit favorable long-term prospects. Does the company have a consistent operating history? Does it have a dominant business franchise? Is the business generating high and sustainable profit margins? If the company's share price is trading below expectations for its future growth, then it's a stock Buffett may want to own.
price will shoot up very soon! cheers"

IR4.0: On the brink of technological revolution
Malaysia is one of the countries forging ahead with Industry 4.0 (IR4.0). The objective is to modernise our industrial capability, and transform the economy from a low-cost manufacturing country into a high-value competing manufacturer.
Throughout the years, advanced economies have invested heavily in research and development.
According to the Global Innovation Index 2018 by the World Intellectual Property Organisation, all countries within the top 15 ranking were high-income advanced economies.
Germany’s “Industrie 4.0”, first mooted by the government in 2011 via the High-Tech Strategy 2020 Action Plan, focused on transforming its manufacturing sector into a leading advanced cyber physical system provider.
In 2012, the United States adopted the “Smart Manufacturing” strategy policy to utilise networked data and Information & Communication Technologies (ICT) for their manufacturing processes.
Three years later, China introduced its “Made in China 2025” policy to secure its position as a global powerhouse in high-tech industries such as robotics, aviation, and new energy vehicles such as electric and biogas.
Japan is now positioning itself to introduce the next phase of Smart Manufacturing to secure its future manufacturing capabilities and increase digitisation through “Industrial Value Chain Initiative”. According to the EU-Japan Centre, the Japanese Internet of Things (IoT) market is projected to grow to US$126bil by 2020; this is 2.2 times its size in 2015.
In simple terms, the next industrial revolution is taking shape around the globe. Major advanced economies around the world are expecting a significant boost to their manufacturing firms’ competitiveness via IR4.0 methodologies.
Dawn of IR4.0 in Malaysia
For the past 10 years, Malaysia’s manufacturing sector has contributed ~23% to the country’s GDP. To achieve its high income status by 2023, manufacturing remains a core sector of sustainable growth under the 11th Malaysia Plan.
At present, the quick pace of technology advancement is beginning to pave the way for an imminent disruptive wave of IR4.0 in Malaysia.
Many firms attempt to maximise productivity and profitability while being cost-effective by leveraging on disruptive technologies such as IoT, artificial intelligence, automation & robotics, biotechnology, and more.
Not surprisingly, Malaysia is already feeling the effects of disruptive technology, from e-hailing taxi apps such as Grab, to shopping within the comfort of our own home without needing to be physically present at the mall using online shopping apps such as Shopee and Lazada.
In 2016, Malaysian household spending on goods (food and non-alcoholic beverage, clothing and footwear, furnishing and household equipment) fell to 26% of total household spending when compared to 33% in 1994.
Meanwhile, spending on services (health, recreation and culture, education, restaurants and hotels) increased from 20% of household expenditure in 1994 to 22% in 2016. This is clear evidence of the shift in consumption preferences away from goods towards services.
Besides the shift in preference towards services, the proliferation of e-commerce has also altered consumer behaviour. Since e-commerce requires a manufacturing firm with flexible and agile production capacity, the traditional manufacturing model of mass production is slowly losing its significance.
To survive the age of disruption, manufacturers need to adopt a business strategy that can respond quickly to consumer needs and market changes in a cost-effective manner.
Unlike today’s economy that often focuses on generic behavioural competencies, IR4.0 will transform the labour market into a skill-centric type of market, with respect to Information Technology (IT), data analytics, process understanding, and the ability to work with modern interfaces.
Currently, certain jobs do not need these skills. This implies that the core qualifications and skills used in today’s job market are insufficient to revolutionise the manufacturing sector. In short, increased automation will put many low-skilled workers out of job.
In 2016, Foxconn reportedly replaced around 60,000 factory workers with robots, and assigned those workers to tackle higher value-added elements in the manufacturing process.
Lack of standards and technology is another issue that may delay the industrial revolution. According to the Networked Readiness Index by the World Economic Forum, Malaysia ranks 31st out of 139 countries in exploiting the opportunities offered by ICT.
One example is the banking & finance sector, which is in the midst of being transformed or disrupted by digital banks and FinTech companies. In the new era of IR4.0, one shouldn’t be surprised if fintech poses a threat to traditional banking."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=113","Jan 10, 2020 9:35 AM","THEREALDEAL","In fact, digital transformation is the main reason just over half of the companies on the Fortune 500 have disappeared since 2000.
Nevertheless, the level of disruptions, and the risks and opportunities differ across sectors. Essentially, the substance of this revolution lies on the application of available new technologies.
Despite the rapid emergence of IR4.0, there are still many local firms who are unaware that it may transform or replace their existing production methods altogether. In time, technology will transform the overall market structure and revolutionize to more efficient production methods.
This brings us to the main question: is Malaysia fully prepared for IR4.0?
The most recent Malaysia’s National Policy in IR4.0, “Industry Forward” (Industry4WRD) launched on 31 October 2018 by Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir, aims to help transform Malaysia’s manufacturing sector to be stronger and smarter.
This policy is expected to position Malaysia as a strategic partner for smart manufacturing, a primary hub for high-tech industries, as well as total solutions provider for the manufacturing sector in Asia Pacific by 2025.
Industry4WRD is expected to increase the productivity in the manufacturing sector per person by 30% from US$24,486 to US$3,132. This would elevate the absolute contribution of the manufacturing sector to the economy by 54% from US$61bil to US$94bil.
In conjunction with that, there must be a clear overarching policy and coordination by the government to provide an enabling ecosystem for the manufacturing sector to thrive by adopting new technologies, while strengthening on-going structural reforms.
To do this, the government might want to consider providing further assistance to SMEs by measuring their gaps and readiness, and guiding them to adopt IR4.0 technologies.
Despite that, the Malaysian education system should also be imperatively realigned for global recognition and relevance. The formation of Centre of Excellence in polytechnics by Malaysia Technical University Network as an effort to cultivate and improve the quality and multidisciplinary of R&D pertinent to IR4.0 is highly appreciated.
It is also important for private firms to invest in re-skilling and up-skilling their employees, and new entrants into the labour workforce. This is to sharpen the skillset of the workers in tandem to the new operating landscape – consistent with the policy’s target to increase the number of high-skilled workers in the industry from 18% to 35%.
In a nutshell, Malaysia’s future productivity growth is highly dependent on the ability of enablers and adaptors to apply advanced knowledge and technologies associated with the revolution to ensure a sustainable economic growth."

New Industry 4.0 technologies, spanning mobile computing to cloud computing, have undergone vast development in the last decade and are now ready to be used as commercially available, interconnected systems within manufacturing – this is Industry 4.0. It holds the key to accessing real-time results and data that will catapult the industry into new levels of lean achievements.
The concept of Industry 4.0 however, is not a simple one. It envelops many technologies and is used in a variety of different contexts. There are five pieces that define Industry 4.0 at its core. Each piece is similar in nature but, when integrated together, create capability that has never before been possible. In an effort to understand Industry 4.0, the following five terms are explained as they contribute to the next industrial revolution:
1. Big Data
As per Forbes, Big Data is a collection of data from traditional and digital sources inside and outside your company that represents a source for ongoing discovery and analysis. Today data is collected everywhere, from systems and sensors to mobile devices. The challenge is that the industry is still in the process of developing methods to best interpret data. It’s the evolution of Industry 4.0 that will change the way organizations and solutions within those organizations work together; teams will be able to make better, smarter decisions.
2. Smart Factory
The concept of Smart Factory is the seamless connection of individual production steps, from planning stages to actuators in the field. In the near future, machinery and equipment will be able to improve processes through self-optimization; systems will autonomously adapt to the traffic profile and network environment. Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs), are an integral part of the Smart Factory, as their autonomous intelligence connects the factory together, allowing seamless operations.
Leading by example is the Siemens Electronic Works facility in Amberg, Germany. Smart machines coordinate production and global distribution or a built-to-order process involving roughly 1.6 billion components. When the Smart Factory is achieved, it will represent a pivotal shift for Industry 4.0, as the revolution will begin to roll out across multiple verticals. Various markets spanning healthcare to consumer goods will adapt Industry 4.0 technologies initially modelled in the Smart Factory.
3. Cyber Physical Systems
Cyber physical systems are integrations of computation, networking and physical processes. Computers and networks monitor and control physical processes with feedback loops; the physical system reacts, the system uses software to interpret actions and tracks results. The notion centers on computers and software being embedded in devices where the first use is not computation; rather it is a loop of action and machine learning.
4. Internet of Things (IoT)
The internet of things is a simple term for a grandiose concept. IoT is the connection of all devices to the internet and each other. As Wired said, “it’s built on cloud computing and networks of data-gather sensors; it’s mobile, virtual, and instantaneous connection.” This interconnection will enable “smart factories” to take shape as equipment will use data to manufacture, move, report and learn at astounding rates, efficiently. Click here to learn how the industrial IoT drives productivity in factories.
5. Interoperability
Interoperability is in essence what happens when we bring the above elements together. It is the connection of cyber-physical systems, humans and smart factories communicating with each other through the IoT. In doing so, manufacturing partners can effectively share information, error-free. Consider that no single company can dictate all its partners use the same software or standards for how the information is represented. Interoperability enables error-free transmission and translation.
From 3D prints to self-driving vehicles, Industry 4.0 technologies are propelling the manufacturing industry with new means of efficiency, accuracy and reliability. The level of intelligence offered today is only the beginning for what is to come."

KUALA LUMPUR: The crude palm oil (CPO) futures contract on Bursa Malaysia Derivatives is expected to trend higher next week on better demand following last-minute buying from the Chinese market ahead of Chinese New Year.
Singapore-based Palm Oil Analytics owner and co-founder Dr Sathia Varqa said exports to the country will drive higher supply in the near term.
""China needs to buy the crop at least next week because it usually takes 10 to 12 days for the commodity to arrive in the country before Chinese New Year on Jan 25, ” he told Bernama.
Furthermore, Sathia said the market sentiment was also supported by the finalisation of the phase one trade deal between the US and China expected to be signed soon.
""Supportive external event of US-China trade deal next week will give a positive momentum to CPO prices, ” he said.
For the week just ended, the market was mixed on weaker production as well as the reinstatement of the CPO export tax on Jan 1 and restriction on imports of refined palm oil and palm olein by India.
On a Friday-to-Friday basis, the CPO futures contract for January 2020 rose RM21 to RM3,131 per tonne, February 2020 expanded RM19 to RM3,145, March 2020 increased RM18 to RM3,134 and April 2020 added RM12 to RM3,110 per tonne.
Weekly turnover increased to 288,983 lots from 164,912 lots in the previous week, while open interest rose to 279,059 contracts versus 267,359 contracts.

Self-driving vehicles (SDVs) are a primary example of this technological evolution. Compared to their predecessors (autonomous guided vehicles), SDVs offer industrial centers increased flexibility and efficiency, higher throughput rates, and a faster return on investment. They move through plants with purpose, finding the most efficient route to their final destination by way of infrastructure-free navigation (no beacons, magnetic tape or cables). Onboard intelligence provides obstacle avoidance to ensure safe, collaborative work environments. Meanwhile, SDVs such as OTTO also offer intuitive light signals, much like vehicles on outdoor roads, to effectively communicate behaviors like turning, stopping, or parking. SDVs collect and share data from within the fleet, whether that fleet is used in one facility or many. Therefore, executives have visibility of real-time data and are able to make informed, educated decisions to positively impact KPIs and grow of their operation.
SDVs are only one example of how Industry 4.0 is going to transform the manufacturing sector. This industrial revolution will collect, use and share data so that industry can reach new heights in safety and efficiency, driving the sector closer to the ultimate goal of lights-out manufacturing."

1. Average people think MONEY is the root of all evil. Rich people believe POVERTY is the root of all evil.
“The average person has been brainwashed to believe rich people are lucky or dishonest,” Siebold writes.
That’s why there’s a certain shame that comes along with “getting rich” in lower-income communities.
“The world class knows that while having money doesn’t guarantee happiness, it does make your life easier and more enjoyable.”
2. Average people think selfishness is a vice. Rich people think selfishness is a virtue.
“The rich go out there and try to make themselves happy. They don’t try to pretend to save the world,” Siebold told Business Insider.
The problem is that middle class people see that as a negative––and it’s keeping them poor, he writes.
“If you’re not taking care of you, you’re not in a position to help anyone else. You can’t give what you don’t have.”
3. Average people have a lottery mentality. Rich people have an action mentality.
“While the masses are waiting to pick the right numbers and praying for prosperity, the great ones are solving problems,” Siebold writes.
“The hero [middle class people] are waiting for may be God, government, their boss or their spouse. It’s the average person’s level of thinking that breeds this approach to life and living while the clock keeps ticking away.”
4. Average people think the road to riches is paved with formal education. Rich people believe in acquiring specific knowledge.
“Many world-class performers have little formal education, and have amassed their wealth through the acquisition and subsequent sale of specific knowledge,” he writes.
“Meanwhile, the masses are convinced that master’s degrees and doctorates are the way to wealth, mostly because they are trapped in the linear line of thought that holds them back from higher levels of consciousness…The wealthy aren’t interested in the means, only the end.”
5. Average people long for the good old days. Rich people dream of the future.
“Self-made millionaires get rich because they’re willing to bet on themselves and project their dreams, goals and ideas into an unknown future,” Siebold writes.
“People who believe their best days are behind them rarely get rich, and often struggle with unhappiness and depression.”
6. Average people see money through the eyes of emotion. Rich people think about money logically.
“An ordinarily smart, well-educated and otherwise successful person can be instantly transformed into a fear-based, scarcity driven thinker whose greatest financial aspiration is to retire comfortably,” he writes.
“The world class sees money for what it is and what it’s not, through the eyes of logic. The great ones know money is a critical tool that presents options and opportunities.”
7. Average people earn money doing things they don’t love. Rich people follow their passion.“To the average person, it looks like the rich are working all the time,” Siebold says. “But one of the smartest strategies of the world class is doing what they love and finding a way to get paid for it.”
On the other hand, middle class take jobs they don’t enjoy “because they need the money and they’ve been trained in school and conditioned by society to live in a linear thinking world that equates earning money with physical or mental effort.”
8. Average people set low expectations so they’re never disappointed. Rich people are up for the challenge.
“Psychologists and other mental health experts often advise people to set low expectations for their life to ensure they are not disappointed,” Siebold writes.
“No one would ever strike it rich and live their dreams without huge expectations.”
9. Average people believe you have to DO something to get rich. Rich people believe you have to BE something to get rich.
“That’s why people like Donald Trump go from millionaire to nine billion dollars in debt and come back richer than ever,” he writes.
“While the masses are fixated on the doing and the immediate results of their actions, the great ones are learning and growing from every experience, whether it’s a success or a failure, knowing their true reward is becoming a human success machine that eventually produces outstanding results.”
10. Average people believe you need money to make money. Rich people use other people’s money.
Linear thought might tell people to make money in order to earn more, but Siebold says the rich aren’t afraid to fund their future from other people’s pockets.“Rich people know not being solvent enough to personally afford something is not relevant. The real question is, ‘Is this worth buying, investing in, or pursuing?'” he writes."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=113","Jan 14, 2020 9:16 AM","MohdZaha","11. Average people believe the markets are driven by logic and strategy. Rich people know they’re driven by emotion and greed.
Investing successfully in the stock market isn’t just about a fancy math formula.
“The rich know that the primary emotions that drive financial markets are fear and greed, and they factor this into all trades and trends they observe,” Siebold writes.
“This knowledge of human nature and its overlapping impact on trading give them strategic advantage in building greater wealth through leverage.”
12. Average people live beyond their means. Rich people live below theirs.
“Here’s how to live below your means and tap into the secret wealthy people have used for centuries: Get rich so you can afford to,” he writes.
“The rich live below their means, not because they’re so savvy, but because they make so much money that they can afford to live like royalty while still having a king’s ransom socked away for the future.”
13. Average people teach their children how to survive. Rich people teach their kids to get rich.
Rich parents teach their kids from an early age about the world of “haves” and “have-nots,” Siebold says. Even he admits many people have argued that he’s supporting the idea of elitism.
He disagrees.
“[People] say parents are teaching their kids to look down on the masses because they’re poor. This isn’t true,” he writes. “What they’re teaching their kids is to see the world through the eyes of objective reality––the way society really is.”
If children understand wealth early on, they’ll be more likely to strive for it later in life.
14. Average people let money stress them out. Rich people find peace of mind in wealth.
The reason wealthy people earn more wealth is that they’re not afraid to admit that money can solve most problems, Siebold says.
“[The middle class] sees money as a never-ending necessary evil that must be endured as part of life. The world class sees money as the great liberator, and with enough of it, they are able to purchase financial peace of mind.”
15. Average people would rather be entertained than educated. Rich people would rather be educated than entertained.
While the rich don’t put much stock in furthering wealth through formal education, they appreciate the power of learning long after college is over, Siebold says.
“Walk into a wealthy person’s home and one of the first things you’ll see is an extensive library of books they’ve used to educate themselves on how to become more successful,” he writes.
“The middle class reads novels, tabloids and entertainment magazines.”
16. Average people think rich people are snobs. Rich people just want to surround themselves with like-minded people.
The negative money mentality poisoning the middle class is what keeps the rich hanging out with the rich, he says.
“[Rich people] can’t afford the messages of doom and gloom,” he writes. “This is often misinterpreted by the masses as snobbery.
Labeling the world class as snobs is another way the middle class finds to feel better bout themselves and their chosen path of mediocrity.”
17. Average people focus on saving. Rich people focus on earning.
Siebold theorizes that the wealthy focus on what they’ll gain by taking risks, rather than how to save what they have.
“The masses are so focused on clipping coupons and living frugally they miss major opportunities,” he writes.
“Even in the midst of a cash flow crisis, the rich reject the nickle and dime thinking of the masses. They are the masters of focusing their mental energy where it belongs: on the big money.”
18. Average people play it safe with money. Rich people know when to take risks.
“Leverage is the watchword of the rich,” Siebold writes.
“Every investor loses money on occasion, but the world class knows no matter what happens, they will aways be able to earn more.”
19. Average people love to be comfortable. Rich people find comfort in uncertainty.
For the most part, it takes guts to take the risks necessary to make it as a millionaire––a challenge most middle class thinkers aren’t comfortable living with.
“Physical, psychological, and emotional comfort is the primary goal of the middle class mindset,” Siebold writes.
World class thinkers learn early on that becoming a millionaire isn’t easy and the need for comfort can be devastating. They learn to be comfortable while operating in a state of ongoing uncertainty.”"

While the middle class squabbles over the virtues of Obamacare and their company’s health plan, the super wealthy are enrolled in a super elite “boutique medical care” association, Siebold says.
“They pay a substantial yearly membership fee that guarantees them 24-hour access to a private physician who only serves a small group of members,” he writes.
“Some wealthy neighborhoods have implemented this strategy and even require the physician to live in the neighborhood.”
21. Average people believe they must choose between a great family and being rich. Rich people know you can have it all.
The idea the wealth must come at the expense of family time is nothing but a “cop-out”, Siebold says.
“The masses have been brainwashed to believe it’s an either/or equation,” he writes. “The rich know you can have anything you want if you approach the challenge with a mindset rooted in love and abundance.”"

Areas of Opportunities for Value Investors: The Cycles of Investment Fashion - The Risk-Arbitrage Cycle
Many participants in specialized areas of investing such as bankruptcy and risk arbitrage have experienced inferior results in recent years.
One reason is the proliferation of investors in these areas. In a sense, there is a cycle of investment results attendant on any investment philosophy or market niche due to the relative popularity or lack of popularity of that approach at a particular time. When an area of investment such as risk arbitrage or bankruptcy investing becomes popular, more money flows to specialists in the area. The increased buying bids up prices, increasing the short-term returns of investors and to some extent creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. This attracts still more investors, bidding prices up further. While the influx of funds helps to generate strong investment results for the earliest investors, the resultant higher prices serve to reduce future returns.
Ultimately the good investment performance, which was generated largely by those who participated in the area before it became popular, ends and a period of mediocre or poor results ensues. As poor performance continues, those who rushed into the area become disillusioned. Clients withdraw funds as quickly as they added them a few years earlier. The redemptions force investment managers to raise cash by reducing investment positions. This selling pressure causes prices to drop, exacerbating the poor investment performance. Eventually much of the ""hot money"" leaves the area, allowing the smaller number of remaining investors to exploit existing opportunities as well as the newly created bargains resulting from the forced selling. The stage is set for another up-cycle.
Risk arbitrage has undergone such a cycle during the past several years.
In the early 1980s there were only a few dozen risk arbitrageurs, each of whom managed relatively small pools of capital. Their repeated successes received considerable publicity, and a number of new arbitrage boutiques were established. The increased competition did not immediately destroy the investment returns from risk arbitrage; the supply of such investments increased at the same time, due to a simultaneous acceleration in corporate takeover activity.
By the late 1980s many new participants had entered risk arbitrage. Relatively unsophisticated individual investors and corporations had become significant players. They tended to bid up prices, which resulted in narrower ""spreads"" between stock prices and deal values and consequently lower returns with more risk. Excess returns that previously had been available from arbitrage investing disappeared.
In 1990 several major takeovers fell through and merger activity slowed dramatically. Many risk arbitrageurs experienced significant losses, and substantial capital was withdrawn from the area. Arbitrage departments at several large Wall Street firms were eliminated, and numerous arbitrage boutiques went out of business. This development serves, of course, to enhance the likelihood of higher potential returns in the future for those who continue to play.
It is important to recognize that risk-arbitrage investing is not a sudden market fad like home-shopping companies or closed end country funds.
Over the long run this area remains attractive because it affords legitimate opportunities for investors to do well.
Opportunity exists in part because the complexity of the required analysis limits the number of capable participants.
Further, risk arbitrage investments, which offer returns that generally are unrelated to the performance of the overall market, are incompatible with the goals of relative-performance-oriented investors.
Since the great majority of investors avoid risk-arbitrage investing, there is a significant likelihood that attractive returns will be attainable for the handful who are able and willing to persevere."

First case of new virus behind China outbreak found in Thailand: WHO
GENEVA: The World Health Organization confirmed Monday the first case in Thailand of a new virus from the same family as SARS that is behind a Chinese pneumonia outbreak.
The UN health agency said a person travelling from Wuhan, China, had been hospitalised in Thailand on January 8 after being diagnosed with mild pneumonia.
“Laboratory testing subsequently confirmed that the novel coronavirus was the cause,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told AFP in an email, referring to the new virus.
WHO said it might soon host an emergency meeting on the spread of the new virus.
The case marks the first outside of China, where 41 people with pneumonia-like symptoms have so far been diagnosed with the new virus in the central city of Wuhan, with one of the victims dying last Thursday.
The episode has caused alarm due to the spectre of SARS, or Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which in 2002-2003 killed 349 people in mainland China and another 299 in Hong Kong, whose economy was hit hard by the epidemic’s devastating impact on tourism.
The WHO has confirmed that the outbreak in China has been caused by a previously unknown type of corona virus, a broad family ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses like SARS.
The agency said Monday it had been informed by Thai health officials that the patient there was recovering from the illness.
It stressed that it was not surprising that the virus had spread beyond China.
“The possibility of cases being identified in other countries was not unexpected, and reinforces why WHO calls for on-going active monitoring and preparedness in other countries,” it said in a statement.
It pointed out that it had issued guidance on how to detect and treat people who fall ill with the new virus, and stressed that China’s decision to rapidly share the genetic sequencing of the virus made it possible to quickly diagnose patients.
WHO has not recommended any specific measures for travellers or restrictions on trade with China, but stressed Monday it was taking the situation seriously.
“Given developments, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus will consult with Emergency Committee members and could call for a meeting of the committee on short notice,” it said in a statement."

“We must develop a comprehensive and globally shared view of how technology is affecting our lives and reshaping our economic, social, cultural, and human environments. There has never been a time of greater promise, or greater peril.” — Klaus Schwab
We are in the midst of the fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0 as its more commonly known.
Of course, with a great opportunity, comes great challenges. But before we delve any deeper, let’s look at what Industry 4.0 is in a nutshell.
Industry 4.0 is the of automation information and data exchange in manufacturing technologies. The notion includes cyber-physical systems, the Internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing.
In essence, Industry 4.0 creates what has been called a smart factory.
To elaborate, digital technology has changed the face of industrial and manufacturing world. The convergence of IoT, Artificial Intelligence and robots, among other advancements, has enabled smart factories as well as the quantum leap into Industry 4.0.
This involves the integration of the physical and software in production, as well as the service sector. Amazon, Uber, Facebook, ‘smart factories’ and 3D printing, are among modern pioneers of the new industrial revolution.
Industry 4.0 is coming fast and to compete in tomorrow’s world, and beyond, tech companies must evolve with the times. So, the question is: are you ready for Industry 4.0? And what challenges will you face in the near future.
Let’s take a look.
Industry 4.0: the challenges
As Industry 4.0 continues to change the way we interact with the world around us, new challenges arise. Here are the main challenges you may face in the not so distant future:
● New business models — the definition of a new strategy
● Rethinking your organization and processes to maximise new outcomes
● Understanding your business case
● Conducting successful pilots
● Helping your organization to understand where action is needed
● Change management, something that is too often overlooked
● Examination of company culture
● The genuine interconnection of all departments
● Recruiting and developing new talent"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=114","Jan 14, 2020 5:22 PM","THEREALDEAL","The Internet of Things (IoT) will connect machines and systems and allow seamless data transmission across all departments of a workplace, opening up opportunities for entirely new business models in manufacturing, computing, and many other industries.
Talking to the Strait Times about the manufacturing sector, IoT expert Dr Gunther Kegel explained, “A device originally used for simple protection can now provide data, which can, for instance, be sold to insurance companies. All of a sudden, your business model is completely different.”
To thrive and indeed survive in tomorrow’s world, you will need to look at each of the above challenges and act upon them as soon as possible. But, it’s important to remember that above all, Industry 4.0 requires businesses and organisations to adopt a fresh thinking mindset, understanding the power of the inter-connectivity realised by new technologies.
By being able to adopt a new mindset, refresh your company culture, adapt your business model, create new roles and nurture the talent to fulfil those roles, the rest will follow, as long as your change is managed closely throughout the process.
Industry 4.0: the benefits
Similar to digital transformation, the benefits of Industry 4.0 will ultimately help a business become smarter and more efficient.
To summarise, here are the key benefits of the new industrial revolution…
● Enhanced productivity through optimisation and automation
● Real-time data for real-time supply chains in a real-time economy
● Greater business continuity through advanced maintenance and monitoring possibilities
● Higher quality products as a result of real-time monitoring, IoT-enabled quality improvement and cobots
● Better working conditions and superior sustainability
● Personalisation opportunities that will earn the trust and loyalty the modern consumer
With an understanding of what you have to gain from harnessing the power of Industry 4.0, taking the actions required to realise it will be all the more easier.
It’s true that Industry 4.0 comes with its fair share of challenges, but by facing them head on it’s clear to see that you have everything to gain."

KUALA LUMPUR (Bernama): The High Court here has set Feb 5 for mention of the Government's RM27.2bil (US$6.5bil) 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) bond cases against Goldman Sachs (Singapore) Pte.
Judge Mohamed Zaini Mazlan fixed the date after Deputy Public Prosecutor Zaki Asyraf Zubir informed the court that the notice of summons had yet to be served on the company due to technical grounds.
""There was an old date on the summons (that was) issued to Goldman Sachs (Singapore). Due to that, Singapore Goldman Sachs refused to accept our summons served on them,"" he told the court here on Tuesday (Jan 14).
Following that, Mohamed Zaini set Feb 5 as the new mention date.
Also present were lawyers Krishna Dallumah and Datuk Prem Ramachandran, representing Goldman Sachs (Singapore).
Meanwhile, at the Magistrate's Court before Magistrate Nur Farah Ain Roslan, Zaki Asyraf informed the court that the prosecution would issue a new notice of summons with the correct date.
Nur Farah also set Feb 5 for mention.
The High Court had previously fixed today to hear the prosecution's application to transfer the case involving Goldman Sachs (Singapore) from the Magistrate's Court to the High Court.
In December last year, Malaysia filed four charges against investment bank and financial services company Goldman Sachs at the Magistrate's Court here for allegedly leaving out material facts on the sale of bonds between a subsidiary of 1MDB and Aabar Investment PJS Ltd (Aabar).
The offences were allegedly committed at 1MDB's premises at Level 8, Menara IMC, No. 8, Jalan Sultan Ismail here, between March 19,2012 and Nov 11,2013.
The company was charged under Section 179(c) of the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007, which carries a penalty of imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years and a fine of not less than RM1mil, upon conviction.
Former Goldman Sachs banker Roger Ng Chong Hwa has also claimed trial to four counts of abetting the company, in reference to the sale of the same bonds by omitting material facts and making false statements.
The United States Department of Justice has estimated that about US$4.5bil was misappropriated from 1MDB between 2009 and 2014"

KUALA LUMPUR: ARB Bhd posted a record net profit of RM8.61mil in the second quarter ended June 30, compared with a net loss of RM271,000 in the same quarter last year, due to stronger revenue from its IT segment.
Its revenue for the quarter jumped 153% RM11.28mil against RM4.45mil from a year ago.
In the first six months, ARB posted a net profit of RM13.68mil on revenue of RM23.7mil.
“Our record-breaking results speak for themselves, demonstrating that ARB has continued the forward momentum of a very strong FY2018.
“We are very confident that FY2019 will be another record year for ARB, driven by the continued high demand for our IT solutions in the areas of enterprise resource planning system and Internet of Things intelligent lifestyle concept,” CEO (Investment & Technology) Datuk Larry Liew Kok Leong said in a statement.
“Our profit in 2QFY2019 is generated from our recurring-income business model, which I believe has reflected in three consecutive quarters. With a market capitalisation of less than RM50mil, I strongly believe ARB is undervalued by the investing community,” Liew added.
ARB has undertaken a slew of corporate measures recently to revamp and restructure the company’s branding, operations and management, in view of ARB’s upgraded long-term business aspirations.
With effect from April 22, the company has adopted its current name of ARB, which was formerly known as ATURMAJU RESOURCES BHD to reflect its new corporate identity and greater plans for the company."

KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 15): Standard Chartered is forecasting Malaysia's gross domestic product growth at 4.5% this year, a similar pace to 2019, with private consumption to remain the main growth driver.
Speaking to reporters at a media briefing here today, its chief economist for Asean and South Asia Edward Lee said although the economy growing at a steady pace, the growth is still lacklustre.
He explained that the pace of spending may ease due to high base effect, and there are some early signs of softening in the labour market. Lee, however, noted that the labour market is still ""solid"".
Nevertheless, Lee pointed out that the US-China trade war de-escalation, loose global monetary conditions and pick-up in the electronics sector may be balanced by a slower pace of consumer spending and subdued sentiment domestically.
He also added that the overall investment may recover slightly in 2020 amid the US-China de-escalation and the resumption of infrastructure projects.
""There could still be some upside [catalyst to Malaysia's economic growth]. If investor confidence comes back, investments come back, we can certainly see Malaysia performing better than 4.5%,"" said Lee."

BEIJING : China and the United States pledged in their phase-one trade agreement on Wednesday (Jan 15) to accelerate two-way opening of the financial service sector and expand market access for each other's companies -- a move that is mutually beneficial and in line with China's objectives, analysts said on Thursday.
The countries agreed to provide fair, effective and nondiscriminatory market access for each other's financial companies in sectors such as banking, securities, insurance, futures, asset management, electronic payments and credit rating.
They also reached consensus on macroeconomic policies and exchange rates, recognising that strong fundamentals, sound policies and a resilient international monetary system are essential to exchange rate stability. Stability, in turn, leads to strong and sustainable growth and investment.
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, said in a statement that the agreement reflected the progress China has made to actively push an orderly opening-up of the financial sector, which helps the competitiveness and resilience of the Chinese financial system and will boost China-US cooperation.
Dong Yan, a research fellow at the Institute of World Economics and Politics, noted that financial opening is an established national policy. The country has adopted a fresh round of liberalising measures that largely reflect the content of the agreement on financial services.
""The opening of the financial service sector will be mutually beneficial. The agreement included commitments from both China and the US. It will also enable Chinese financial institutions to go abroad and carry out business in the US market,"" Dong said.
Under the agreement, China will eliminate foreign equity limits in securities, fund management and futures, as well as in the life insurance, pension and health insurance sectors, no later than April 1. The country will also grant US companies greater market access in the areas of credit rating services, electronic payments and management of debt distress.
Meanwhile, the US affirmed in the agreement that it will expeditiously consider pending requests by Chinese financial institutions, including CITIC Group, China International Capital Corp and China Reinsurance Group.
Dong said that further financial opening will not likely have a negative effect on China's financial security, as it will focus mainly on business cooperation. Chinese regulators will continue to improve their capabilities and make them compatible with the level of opening.
Li Chao, chief researcher of macroeconomy at Huatai Securities, said one highlight of the China-US agreement is the opening-up of the electronic payment sector. It signals that US companies such as Visa and MasterCard will take a step forward in China's vast payment market, Li said in a research note.
In the agreement, the US also promised to give nondiscriminatory treatment to Chinese electronic payment service suppliers, such as UnionPay.
The phase one trade agreement and the bilateral commitment to further liberalise the financial industry have boosted corporate confidence.
""We are encouraged that the United States and China are making progress in addressing the trade concerns that exist between the two countries,"" American Express said in a written note.
The US company is waiting for the regulatory approval for its Chinese joint venture to start the clearing and settlement business in China."

HONG KONG :- Chinese authorities have reported a second death from a mystery virus that has left dozens of people ill in the city of Wuhan, Hong Kong media reports said.
The Wuhan health authorities reported late on Thursday (Jan 16) that a 69-year-old man, who was first taken ill on Dec 31, died on Wednesday at the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital in Hubei province after a two-week illness that progressed to multi-organ system failure. His symptoms became more severe on Jan 4, broadcaster RTHK reported.
The first death from the mystery virus occurred in China on Jan 9. The victim was a 61-year-old man who had serious underlying medical conditions.
News of the latest death came hours after it emerged that a second case of the novel coronavirus had been reported outside China. Japanese authorities said that a man in Kanagawa prefcture had fallen ill after visiting Wuhan.
The first case outside China was detected in Thailand on Monday - a 61-year-old Chinese woman who had been hospitalised for high fever and breathing difficulties. She is now in a stable condition.
After the news of the Japanese case emerged, Hong Kong authorities stepped up their monitoring of the disease, ordering private doctors to report cases of fever and respiratory infection in anyone who had been in a mainland hospital or come into contact with anyone who had the new virus, RTHK reported.
Previously, doctors had been required to report such symptoms to the Centre for Health Protection only for patients who had actually been to Wuhan.
There have been no confirmed cases of the disease in Hong Kong so far.
Wuhan has recorded a total of 41 cases of the new virus, of whom five are in a serious condition
In Singapore, a third suspected case was reported on Thursday. The Ministry of Health said a 69-year-old man who travelled to Wuhan has been diagnosed with pneumonia.
The man, a Singaporean, had not visited the seafood wholesale market in Huanan, from whence the new bug is thought to have emerged. Investigations are ongoing to establish whether his illness is linked to the Wuhan disease cluster.
Meanwhile, two Chinese tourists with fever symptoms from Wuhan were quarantined by Vietnam's Ministry of Health and are now under observation after they landed at Danang International Airport on Tuesday.
Hanoi dispatched a medical team to the coastal city and called an emergency meeting on Wednesday on prevention efforts.
The World Health Organisation, which has said that the virus has ""some limited human-to-human transmission"", is not taking any chances and has warned of a potential wider outbreak.
The region is gearing up on precautionary measures, with an expected surge in Chinese visitors during the Chinese New Year holiday later this month, with more stringent health monitoring checks and quarantine procedures for those who visited Wuhan recently.
Many countries in the region, including Japan and Indonesia, are stepping up health screening of inbound travellers.

KUALA LUMPUR (Bernama): Pakatan Harapan will learn from the outcome of the Kimanis parliamentary by-election and will make changes to win the support of the people, says Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail.
""We have heard (the voice of the people) and will take this as a lesson to guide us in improving the situation in order for us to regain the mandate and support of the people,"" the Deputy Prime Minister told reporters here Sunday (Jan 19).
In the Kimanis parliamentary by-election on Saturday (Jan 18) Barisan Nasional retained the seat after its candidate, Datuk Mohamad Alamin, 48, won by a majority of 2,029 votes, defeating Datuk Karim Bujang, 67, of Parti Warisan Sabah.
Dr Wan Azizah, who is also Pakatan president, said the government respected the decision of the people in Kimanis who might have been caught up by their own issues at the state level and the parliamentary constituency, including over the Sabah Temporary Pass (PSS).
""The important thing is to see where we ourselves can improve, no doubt there are issues such as the PSS and all, but the PSS decision was made during the Barisan government and they now say that it is all our fault.
""This is not true. We made some improvements to it but probably the message was not passed down,"" she said.
In September last year, the Committee on the Management of Foreign Nationals had agreed to issue the PSS to replace the three documents issued to foreign nationals residing in Sabah, namely the IMM13 passes, census certificate and Kad Burung-Burung beginning June 1 this year.
The proposal on the implementation of the PSS went viral on social media, raising controversies and confusion after the facts were misconstrued by certain parties.
In another development, Dr Wan Azizah said she has left it to the PKR disciplinary board to review and take appropriate action against PKR vice-president Zuraida Kamaruddin, who was given 14 days to respond to a show cause letter, issued to her for allegations of misconduct.
""I will leave it to disciplinary committee because they have to be independent,"" said the PKR advisory council chairman.
Earlier, the Deputy Prime Minister distributed 500 cartons of mandarin oranges and had a friendly meeting with residents under the Pandan parliamentary constituency at the Pandan Jaya morning market in conjunction with the Chinese New Year celebrations.
Meanwhile in BUTTERWORTH, Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said Pakatan will take the results of the Kimanis by-election as a lesson and would strive harder in the best interest of the people.
He said all elected representatives must work harder and focus on the people’s needs especially their economic needs.
""We accept the people's decision in retaining the Barisan stronghold and after this, I would advise all elected representatives to put in more effort,"" he told reporters after the launch of Ops Selamat 16 and the Seberang Prai North Road Safety Campaign in conjunction with the Chinese New Year celebrations here on Sunday."

LANGKAWI (Bernama): The concept of Malaysia Incorporated (Malaysia Inc), which integrates the private and public sectors into one common objective, is now more important than ever to achieve the country’s big and ambitious goals, says Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.
In his speech at the launch of 5G demonstration projects here on Sunday (Jan 19), the Prime Minister said the concept introduced by him during his first stint as premier still applies to this day.
""Because of such collaboration, I am pleased to see that through the 5G demonstration projects, we have identified 100 use cases, of which, we have 72 5G use cases in 56 Live 5G sites across six states that include Kedah, Kuala Lumpur Federal Territory, Perak, Selangor, Terengganu and Penang,” he said.
Dr Mahathir said in this fast-paced and high-octane world, the country needed to be agile as change is a daily constant.
""If we remain stagnant, we will not be able to compete in the global economy,” he added.
The Prime Minister said since he launched the ""5G Malaysia showcase” in April 2019, preparations to deploy 5G had been progressing well and set for commercial roll out in the third quarter of 2020.
""This marks a significant beginning in our nation’s journey towards strengthening our economy to achieve sustainable growth and share the prosperity we gain with our people and ensure that we achieve our target of providing every single citizen in this nation a decent standard of living by 2030,” he said.
Dr Mahathir added that Malaysia risk being left behind if the country does not change as well.
""From the rise of smartphones in 2007 that changed the way we live, to the growth of shale oil in 2014 that triggered one of the largest oil price shocks in history, and to the mighty rise of numerous tech brands like Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Huawei.
""The common denominator was technology,” he said.
Hence, he said the convergence of 5G and different industrial sectors such as agriculture, education, healthcare, manufacturing, smart transportation and tourism, presented new opportunities for industries, society, and individuals to advance their digital ambition and deliver new and better services.
In developing countries, manufacturing continues to be the avenue from subsistence agriculture to rising incomes and living standards.
Similarly, the manufacturing sector had played a key role in turning Malaysia into a major player in the global value chain, he said.
For the past five years, the manufacturing industry has contributed 22% to the country’s gross domestic product.
""Therefore, as the Fourth Industrial Revolution engulfs us, the question we must ask ourselves is - are we ready for it? How do we leverage this transformative technology to enhance productivity and growth?” he asked.
Dr Mahathir said countries like China, the United States and South Korea were already rolling out 5G that will not only provide better experiences for existing applications but also accelerate use cases such as autonomous cars and remote surgeries that were not possible with previous generations of mobile networks.
Citing data by Euromonitor International, he said by 2023, the total sales of Internet retailing in Malaysia would surge to RM30.03bil.
Out of this, RM18bil will be purchases made through smartphones.
This is about three times more than the projected Internet sales of RM11.41bil in 2019.
""Businesses must, however, ensure that technology is able to complement the workforce to become more effective, knowledgeable, and productive.
""Technology that displaces humans runs contrary to the aspiration of the country as outlined in the government’s Shared Prosperity Vision 2030,” he said.
Malaysia, he added, has an abundance of resources as well as prospects, and the country is poised to embark on a new era of growth.
""While this is within our grasp, we are at a tipping point where we can either rise or falter.
""Though the interconnectedness of the economy does not make us immune to global economic headwinds, it is what we continue to strive individually and collectively every day to outperform and push boundaries that will allow us to stay resilient and stride forward confidently,” he noted"

IR4.0 beri kesan kepada semua disiplin undang-undang
KUALA LUMPUR, 29 NOV: Revolusi Industri 4.0 (IR4.0) akan memberi kesan kepada semua disiplin undang-undang, ekonomi dan pelbagai industri secara keseluruhan, kata Yang Dipertua Dewan Rakyat Tan Sri Mohamad Ariff Md Yusof.
Beliau berkata IR4.0 boleh dikategori sebagai penggabungan teknologi baharu yang sangat berkuasa yang menghilangkan garisan antara dunia fizikal, digital dan biologi.
“Dengan ketidakpastian yang timbul dari revolusi perindustrian akan datang, peralihan yang tidak pernah berlaku sebelum ini akan mencetuskan peluang dan harapan yang tinggi, tetapi pada masa yang sama akan menimbulkan kebimbangan dan ketidakselesaan.
“Saya rasa kita perlu melihat dengan teliti undang-undang, bagaimana ia akan memberi kesan kepada peguam secara keseluruhan, mungkin peguam akan menjadi berlebihan, semuanya boleh dilakukan menerusi robotik pintar dan sebagainya,” katanya.
Beliau berkata demikian dalam ucapannya pada Persidangan Undang-undang Antarabangsa ke-10 dengan tema ‘Undang-undang, Kerajaan dan Masyarakat: Menangani Cabaran IR4.0’ di Parlimen di sini hari ini.
Persidangan dua hari yang dianjurkan oleh Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) menyediakan platform untuk intelektual daripada pelbagai bidang dan disiplin dalam undang-undang untuk membahaskan dan membincangkan semua aspek undang-undang dengan penekanan khusus terhadap isu kepelbagaian undang-undang.
Di samping itu, beliau berkata teknologi canggih memisahkan produktiviti daripada tenaga kerja.
“Kemajuan yang seterusnya bermakna, kita mencapai sasaran dengan margin yang signifikan, tetapi dengan pekerja yang lebih sedikit.
“Ia terbukti dalam era teknologi, bahawa permintaan untuk buruh berkemahiran rendah telah menurun sementara pekerja yang berpendidikan tinggi dibayar lebih tinggi dan dikehendaki, menyebabkan peningkatan dalam ketidaksamaan,” katanya."

The fourth industrial revolution - Industry 4.0 - is already on the way to becoming a reality. With its arrival, the modern manufacturing world is moving towards greater automation. Advanced workplaces are replacing traditional production lines and the relationship between man and machine is taking a leap forward.
No one knows the job better than the person who is doing it - that is the idea behind a package of novel ideas designed to make the most of factory workers' knowledge and experience.
In Seinajoki, Finland, metal company Prima Power is trialing two of the EU’s Factory2Fit project solutions.
This €4m study explores new ways for people and machines to work together.
Dr Eija Kaasinen from technical research centre VTT says the aim is to put people at the centre and to enable them to participate in designing their own work environment.
The workers will also have a say in how the work is organised and can share their own practical knowledge with colleagues.
Globally, automation and robotics are transforming manufacturing as part of the fourth industrial revolution. But this doesn't mean the human element is removed from work.
""Of course there are manual elements - but the work is changing towards knowledge work,"" explains Dr Eija Kaasinen. ""It's more like working with the virtual counterparts of the physical things in the physical world.""
The Pre-training Solution, for example, uses 3D models and cloud-based tutorials.
The Knowledge Sharing solution is a way to make the most of all the experience a worker gathers while running complex machinary, especially when something goes wrong, as Prima Power's Mariia Kreposna explains.
""So here the operator can open the additional dialogue box to get extra information about the situation. This is done by sharing the additional text, description, pictures or videos so the idea is in the future whenever the alarm with the same code happens, the operator will be able to learn not only the standard remedies but also other possible reasons and how to prevent this alarm happening in the future.""
'Sleep was really important for my work performance'
At the Elekmerk factory in Keuruu, Finland, workers tested the Worker Feedback Dashboard - a biometric monitoring tool - like a fitbit - and an app.
It charts someone's work achievements and their well being - such as sleep and steps taken per day - and shows how the two can be linked.
""When we interviewed factory workers during the project we heard that often they had negative feedback when something is not going well,"" says VTT's Päivi Heikkilä.. ""So we wanted to develop an application that would also give you positive feedback of the fluency of your work and your accomplishments, so feedback of the things that are going well.""
Ville Vuarola was one of five workers who wore the wristband for the three-month pilot scheme. He was happy to take part and says he was surprised at how a good night's sleep had a positive impact on his job.
""I was surprised to see how sleeping well influenced my work performance. Together with leisure activities, sleep was really important for my general performance at work,"" he says.
'We always consider the ethics'
Of all the Factory2Fit solutions, this was the one that proved the most controversial with fears expressed over the possible misuse of workers' data.
But Päivi Heikkilä says these concerns are unfounded.
""When we are developing these kind of solutions we always consider the ethics,"" she says, ""and I want to stress and highlight that this should always be voluntary.""
The data gathered is kept on a separate server, not in the factory system.
Researchers expect at least some of their Factory2Fit solutions to be commercially available by the end of next year.
happy chinese new year guys!"

Ministry to utilise integrated enforcement management system from today
KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 20 — The Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry (KPDNHEP) has begun to fully utilise the Integrated Enforcement Management System (IEMS) today to conduct price checks on goods.
Minister Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said through the system the enforcement of price of goods will be more structured, while the implementation of the IEMS nationwide would be done in stages.
“With this system, the previous manual implementation will be replaced with a more sophisticated electronic system with programmed tools,” he said after launching the Integrated Enforcement Management System here today.
He said the system would also reduce human error, streamline records and avoid negative perceptions that the summon amount could be manipulated.
“The system will be implemented in six states, namely the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, Melaka, Selangor, Perlis and Negri Sembilan and it will be implemented throughout the country in stages,” he said.
Saifuddin Nasution said the ministry’s enforcement officers inspect between 700,000 and 800,000 premises annually and issue between RM3.5 million to RM4 million worth of compounds a year.
He said failure to display price tags and using the old weighing tool was among the most common offences committed by traders.
Meanwhile, Saifuddin Nasution said 16 kinds of goods were priced under the implementation of the Festive Season Maximum Price Control Scheme (SHMMP) in conjunction with this year’s Chinese New Year celebration, an addition of three items compared to 13 during the same festive season last year.
The three additional items are red chilli, tomatoes and potatoes imported from China.
Among the items listed under the price control scheme are live chicken, standard chicken (slaughtered and cleaned with feet, head, liver and and gizzard or any part thereof), super chickens (slaughtered and cleaned without feet, head, liver and gizzard), grade A, B and C chicken eggs (by weight each), imported round cabbage (Indonesia and China not including Beijing cabbage) and Chinese garlic, white pomfret, large white prawns, live pigs, pork (belly) and pork (meat and fat).
Saifuddin Nasution said the pricing of goods for the states was made in accordance with the current market price and took into account the change in prices, especially for imported goods.
He was also satisfied with the prices of goods at NSK Trade City which was deemed to be very low in conjunction with this year’s festive celebration.
“The price tags are clearly displayed. The price reduction when selling the goods is very significant, for example red chillies should be sold for RM13 per kilo, but instead is offered at RM8.88,” he said.
He said inspections would be conducted by his ministry from time to time at selected premises throughout the duration of the scheme.
Prices of goods will be monitored from January 20 to February 2."

KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 12 -- In moving towards Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR4.0), employees are advised to reskill themselves from now on if they want a promising career in the future.
The National Tech Association of Malaysia (PIKOM) chairman Ganesh Kumar Bangah said this is because digital transformation would bring constant changes and employees must embrace as well as be prepared to adapt with the changes.
“We cannot wait to start on digitalisation…the government has allocated a lot of funding to adopt IR4.0. The job in the future will be different from today; if you are in a job that can be replaced by AI (artificial intelligence) or robots, you have to make sure to reskill yourselves.
“So we need to update now. The challenge we are facing is people don’t understand what IR4.0 is,” he told Bernama at the Asian Oceania Computing Organisation - Pikom Digital Summit 2019 here today.
Ganesh said this summit was organised to give exposure to IR4.0 as well as enhance the engagement among industry players, increase business opportunities and promote growth for the tech industry.
The three-day summit, which began yesterday, has attracted more than 600 participants from over 13 countries in the Asia-Pacific region including Bangladesh, India, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Riding on the theme of 'Defining The Future', the summit will see more than 35 local and regional speakers deliberate on key topics that would define the growing role of technology."

“These aren’t slow growers; these are no growers.” Lynch said turnaround companies are “battered, depressed and often can barely drag themselves into Chapter 11.” If they survive and fix their problems, however, they can rebound very quickly and stock prices are least related to the overall market. One of Lynch’s favorites in this category was Chrysler (now Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU)); it was also a cyclical stock, although that aspect was not as pronounced. From the time he bought in 1982, it became a five-bagger in two years and 15-bagger in five years. He found many opportunities among these temporary losers.

“It is time to reassess and realign your business strategy. Adapt to the current changes of doing business.
“The Industry 4.0 has the potential to transform the industries in many ways.
“Businesses can strive to improve productivity, efficiency, costs, quality and management in the face of IR4.0,” he said in his speech before opening ‘IR 4.0: Connected Factory’ showcase at ECA Advanced Solutions Sdn Bhd in Bukit Minyak today.
Ahmad Zakiyuddin said that the manufacturing industry was an important economic sector which had contributed about 22% of the nation’s gross domestic products (GDP) in the last five years.
“The growing manufacturing industry attracts investments, creates business opportunities and stimulates job creation.
“The manufacturing sector is expected to remain resilient next year,” he added.

BEIJING: A fourth person has died from pneumonia in the central Chinese city of Wuhan following the outbreak of a new coronavirus, health authorities said.
The 89-year-old man developed symptoms on Jan 13 and was admitted to hospital five days later after he experienced severe breathing difficulties, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said in a statement yesterday.
He died on Jan 19.
The commission said the patient also had underlying health diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease.
In a separate statement posted on its official Weibo account, the commission said 15 medical workers in the city had been diagnosed with pneumonia with one other suspected case.
Of the infected staff, one was in critical condition, it added.
Wuhan has designated nine hospitals for pneumonia treatment and 61 fever clinics to tackle the spread.
The city’s health commission published a list of the hospitals and clinics on its website.
A medical expert team has been set up, with 25 members from 10 provincial and municipal hospitals, according to the health commission.
On Monday, a high-level expert team of China’s National Health Commission confirmed people-to-

She also noted that not many students took the initiative to take courses to get additional certifications relevant to the IR4.0 workplace, citing time constraints and a lack of value as their reasons.
While students and parents believe employers are looking to younger talents as technologically-savvy employees who will help them in their digital transformation, graduate respondents paint a different picture that there are organisations unwilling to adopt a new generation of talent, stating legacy issues and an unwillingness to adopt new processes as the key challenges faced in the workplace — pointing to a mismatch of expectations from graduates and the reality in the industry.
INITIATIVES
Tan said INTI has begun the process to equip future talents for the rapidly evolving technological workplace through innovative teaching and learning, and in developing strong industry partnerships with over 450 industry partners.
“Our initiatives will provide students with the experience and readiness for them to be integrated into the workforce, such as real-world employer projects, industry advisory boards, workshops, boot camps, industry-led competitions, short courses and internships where graduates would have gained some experience and insights on how to deal with current challenges when they enter the workforce. Some of the high-tech industry partners that we currently work with on these initiatives include IBM, Google, Alibaba GET, Dell and Glodon,” she said.
In addition to current initiatives, INTI offers Design Thinking as part of the required Mata Pelajaran Umum module across all bachelor’s degree programmes.
This module teaches students to analyse and develop solutions to real-life challenges, to achieve the best outcomes in an innovative and efficient manner.
“Through this module, students work closely with industry, gain exposure to current social issues, and develop their skills in research, presentation, teamwork and the ability to view challenges critically. The programme also empowers students to be socially-conscious while preparing for careers in a digitally-driven world,” Tan said.
INTI also continues to organise its Industry Advisory Boards, where members of faculty and industry meet to evaluate curriculum and the inclusion of industry trends in learning.
“These measures are part of acknowledging that education must change to meet the needs of a new digital era and through this, INTI continues to prepare future talents to be part of the IR4.0 workforce,” Tan remarked.
Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM), meanwhile, has been responsive and actively embarking on IR4.0 related initiatives for the past three years, starting from a campus-wide campaign and awareness drive in 2016.
The university has 13 Data Analytics Labs on various campuses for data camp training programmes that are open to students from all faculties as well as 21 Smart Classrooms that support the design and implementation of Active, Relevant, Interactive and Fun learning (ARIF).
Early this year, the university launched the Pioneering University Framework of UiTM to put forward the provision of High End TVET programmes where UiTM is to introduce emerging technology competencies in the diploma, degree and professional programmes such as Enabling Technologies for Industry 4.0 Revolution as stipulated by the National Policy on Industry 4.0 (Industry4WRD).
Its vice-chancellor, Emeritus Professor Dr Mohd Azraai Kassim, said: “This means that in general, an intuitive approach is taken in designing and developing a fluid, dynamic and organic curriculum”.
“Students are prepared to face the changing world, to be able to use their existing skills and quickly learn new ones to be participating members of society. Other than the 21st century competencies, students must be socially competent, adaptive competent, digital competent and must have a high level of personal competence,” he said.
To have these, the curriculum is built to be both industry and community relevant, with future proof content offered through multidisciplinary electives and academic programmes.
Most programmes have been revised to embed data analytics and/or any of the nine IR4.0 technological advances such as autonomous robots, simulation, system Integration, IoT, cybersecurity, cloud, augmented reality (AR), and additive manufacturing."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=116","Jan 23, 2020 10:10 AM","THEREALDEAL","As an example, the undergraduate degree programmes at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering are built on flexible and organic curriculum where the students are exposed to special topics like Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT) and Robotics.
Elective and non-credit courses are offered across faculties, cross campuses and via multimodal delivery, with the intention of creating a more holistic approach in nurturing students. Such learning materials are provided online to enable easy access and to encourage collaboration with a diverse group of learners.
“To date, there are more than 500 Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) developed and completed in UiTM. By 2021, it is expected that there will be a proliferation of MOOCs and micro learning courses that will allow students to have a learning buffet, with a spread of courses that can be taken out of interest or for further certification in related fields.
“Credit transfer from courses taken from other universities or providers will be instituted to cater for the growing spirit of ubiquitous and distributed learning,” said Mohd Azraai.
He also highlighted that as part of UiTM’s provision of IR4.0, research and development has been and continues to be geared towards emerging technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence.
The university has also drawn up an initiative branded as Education 5.0@UiTM that responds to IR4.0 while emphasising the humanistic part of education.
Education 5.0 is defined as a learning-centric ecosystem that is sustainable, balanced and principled, driven by values, powered by intellect and afforded by new, ubiquitous technologies.
UiTM deputy vice-chancellor (Academic and International) Professor Dr Mohamad Kamal Haron said the initiative focuses on placing the ownership of learning on learners. Nevertheless, he added, the approach emphasises instilling values and principles through less-prescriptive learning.
“Learning is also seamless and learning can happen anywhere, anytime, from any device, with and from anyone, and through any path. Thus learning experience can be designed to be diverse and of variety,” he said.
IR4.0 WORKPLACE
According to Digi chief human resource officer Elisabeth Stene, an IR4.0 workplace is one where employees are empowered to respond quickly to customers, conduct business responsibly and adopt technology to fuel business and work efficiency.
“This is supplemented by dynamic leaders, agile way of work, a strong emphasis on collaboration and a culture where learning is a permanent state to stay relevant. We believe that this is the foundation required for companies to go through disruption and transformation,” she said.
How far has IR4.0 been adapted in the workplace and is the IR4.0 workplace already in existence in Malaysia today?
Stene said the IR4.0 workplace is no longer a new concept as it’s been around for the past three to four years.
Many organisations in the region have indeed adapted and transformed themselves into an IR4.0 workplace, and Digi is one of them.
“We’ve digitalised our core operations and ensured that our people embraced the change well. For such a large-scale transformation, it is crucial to foster the right mindset and culture across the organisation.
“From the onset, we instilled in our people the right mindset — that digital transformation is not just an IT project but a company-wide agenda, sponsored by the entire senior leadership — and the right values that drove a change in our culture.
“I’m pleased to say that we are now reaping the benefits from our digital transformation that enabled Digi to be an IR4.0 workplace today,” said Stene.
Feon Ang, vice president of Talent and Learning Solutions, Asia-Pacific at LinkedIn, meanwhile, observed that both traditional and tech industries are adopting new technologies such as AI and automation to improve operations, introduce new products and services, and provide a better experience for their customers.
“While employers are looking for talent with hard skills in these technologies, it’s soft skills that continue to be important across jobs and industries. Investing in the right talents who have both skill sets is what’s important for the company,” she said.
MOVING FORWARD
Stene noted it is encouraging that most universities in Malaysia have already started ensuring that their curricula is integrated with subjects that are relevant in preparing students for the IR4.0 workplace.
“Higher education institutes should balance theory with practical experience — encourage internships, experiential learning and develop curriculum via partnerships with corporates.
“In return, corporates too should be open and provide opportunities for students to experience the challenges and change their way of working due to Industry 4.0 as these students are the future workforce,” she said."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=116","Jan 23, 2020 10:10 AM","THEREALDEAL","Ang, meanwhile, opined that the most important thing is to encourage everyone to have a growth mindset — especially when they have completed their schooling.
“Learning doesn’t stop at schools. In fact, in schools, we are learning how to learn, as well as understanding and finding our paths. With this, it also takes commitment by the broader ecosystem — from government, companies and education institutions — to help bring this to fruition.
“From a skills perspective, it will be challenging to adapt curriculum solely to cope with hard skills changes. If there’s one thing we’d suggest, the biggest skills gap is soft skills. From leadership, creativity to problem-solving, these are skills that will last for life,” she said.
From the higher education point of view, Tan said being the main provider of competencies needed by graduates for IR4.0, universities must re-evaluate their current offerings.
“Among the skills needed to thrive in IR4.0 are the mastery of key IT skills to enable students to enhance their career prospects.
“For example, a business student should learn how to maximise e-commerce as most business platforms are currently leveraging on the many benefits and success of the e-commerce scene.
“Quantity surveying students should learn how to use building information modelling (BIM) software as most building and construction firms use BIM to improve productivity, promote better collaboration and communication and mitigate risks,” she elaborated.
There should be greater collaboration between higher education and industry partners to enhance curriculum and ensure its relevance to current market demands.
“When students learn current trends in the industry by participating in employer projects, industry-led competitions or internships, they pick up essential skills and knowledge to help them in their future careers.
“Students should also focus on the development of personal skill sets alongside academic excellence. The development of personal skills sets such as teamwork, adaptability to change, ability to communicate effectively and having a mindset for lifelong learning are the competencies that will enable students to remain relevant, regardless of the roles or industries they enter,” she said."

Digital transformation in an old field
IT may be Sunday morning, but you’ll find Nguyen Viet Hung enjoying a coffee, and of course, keep up-to-date with work as he fastidiously checks his smart phone.
At 24 years old, Hung entered Vietnam’s startup community with a debut business named ColorME.
Entering the market five years ago, ColorME offers graphic design courses for young adults at VND500,000 (RM88.13) each.
“It is not a new idea, ” Hung said. “Similar courses have appeared for so long before ColorME.”
Starting up with 45 first trainees who were recruited via a simple Facebook event, his company now teaches 1,000 trainees a month at its four branches, three in Hanoi and one in Ho Chi Minh City.
“After the lightning success of the first batch, the second one witnessed a boom in attendance registration with more than 100 people, ” he said. “This was a eureka moment and I felt the urge to develop an inclusive electronic platform as soon as possible.”
“It is not a zero-sum game, as I started low-key, others can do exactly the same. The problem only comes when your business grows bigger and administrative duties are no longer effective to be implemented manually. You will need an app that helps you cover all the paperwork, present data in the most digestible way for easy tracking and monitoring.”
After five years, the app now has a friendly user interface with minimal layouts running smoothly even in low mobile data mode.
Both trainers and trainees use the system to check in, check out, access to the cloud library, upload products, write and get comments.
“We are trying to detail features and enhance experiences of users as much as possible, ” Hung said.
While trainees can learn anytime, anywhere based on their interests and abilities, their feedback is collected and sorted into key words, becoming an important resource for ColorME team to continuously reflect and update syllabuses to best satisfy changing demands.
Instead of investing into fingerprint machines, the company allows staff to scan QR codes for checking in and checking out which requires location, Wifi connection and registered devices.
Data collected will help to calculate workers’ salary at the end of the month based on their performance.
“The process, commonly known as digital transformation, enables a small company like us to save a lot of money, keep the payroll small and efficient and offer more added value for customers, ” Hung said.
“It feels like we set foot in a field where many others cultivated. How to perfect services and how to grow sustainably, those questions keep echoing in our heads. A capable tool, I think, is our answer.”
Vietnam has set an ambitious goal to have one million enterprises in the first year of the new decade.
Bui Tat Thang, former head of Development Strategies Institute under Ministry of Planning and Investment, stressed innovation as the key for the country’s startup community.
“Vietnam has jumped ten places in the 2019 Global Competitive Index while innovation has been considered as a breakthrough in its ten-year development strategy from 2021 to 2030, ” he said.
“The government needs more assistance policies to unleash the potential of private enterprises, especially technology-based start-ups, at the same time, creating favourable conditions which uphold transparency and accountability for them to develop, ” Thang added.
ColorME has just had its first venture round and gotten support from 18 investors. In the next five years, the company expects to expand to other markets in the region.
“But first, we will start 2020 by launching an e-learning subscription package at VND100,000 per month which offers users courses on demand and the huge resource of some 1,000 articles on graphic design.
The beta version is now being experienced by some 2,000 people, ” Hung said.
“To us, it is a constant progress of trial and error to gradually scale up the company. With the digital platform as a backbone, our aspiration is to simplify operational procedures to a level which allows the instant deployment of courses in a foreign country, ” he said.
“As innovation takes time, we are going on a restless journey.”"

Malaysia on track to become Southeast Asian hub on big data & analytics
KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia is making steady progress in becoming a big data and analytics (BDA) hub in Southeast Asia.
Malaysian Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) chief executive officer (CEO) Datuk Yasmin Mahmood said there are 22 multinational BDA companies from six countries currently setup in Malaysia as of August 2016.
“These include IHS Markit and SiteCore. In addition to this, Fusionex and Data Micron are among the Malaysian companies which have expanded globally,” she said while officiating Big Data Week Asia 2016 today.
Yasmin said that there are 32 BDA companies in total that have exported their services/solutions and 47 BDA start-ups continuously innovating and testing cutting-edge technology in the big data analysis sector.
In terms of addressing talent gap in Asia, MDEC and its key strategic partners have been actively building industry-university partnerships to groom and nurture talent in big data and analytics.
“In addition to introducing postgraduate courses on data science, undergraduate IT-related degrees with data science specialisation are also being introduced,” she said.
Malaysia aims to produce 2,000 data scientists and 16,000 data professionals by 2020.
Currently there are over 300 data scientists in Malaysia, both local and foreign.
“With the support of our partners – Cloudera, Coursera and TheCADs, we are producing data scientists through innovative working models that including forging industry-university collaborations and formulation of industry relevant curriculum,” Yasmin said.
She added that there were 70 data scientists last year who emerged from the model representing corporate multinational companies (MNC), government-linked companies and startups.
Big Data Week Asia 2016 is a week-long congregation at Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre initiated by both MDEC and Olygen Sdn Bhd.
The event is part of MDEC’s effort to catalyse digital innovation ecosystems in expanding opportunities in the area of BDA.
The event will host 3,500 participants from across Asean, 84 world-class speakers, 38 leading exhibitors, 41 sponsors and 17 satellite events focused on building a data-driven Asean.
Kuala Lumpur is the 2016 city partner of Global Big Data Week and the congregation has been officially recognised as the biggest in Asia this year.
Some of the speakers at the event include international thought leaders such as Harvard Business School Professor Karim R. Lakhani, director of Centre of Data Innovation in the US, Daniel Castro, Cloudera co-founder Amr Awadallah and Cornell University data scientist Lutz Finger, along with a host of regional and local speakers.

Big data analytics is the often complex process of examining large and varied data sets, or big data, to uncover information -- such as hidden patterns, unknown correlations, market trends and customer preferences -- that can help organizations make informed business decisions.
On a broad scale, data analytics technologies and techniques provide a means to analyze data sets and draw conclusions about them which help organizations make informed business decisions. Business intelligence (BI) queries answer basic questions about business operations and performance.
Big data analytics is a form of advanced analytics, which involves complex applications with elements such as predictive models, statistical algorithms and what-if analysis powered by high-performance analytics systems.
The importance of big data analytics
Driven by specialized analytics systems and software, as well as high-powered computing systems, big data analytics offers various business benefits, including:
New revenue opportunities
More effective marketing
Better customer service
Improved operational efficiency
Competitive advantages over rivals
Big data analytics applications enable big data analysts, data scientists, predictive modelers, statisticians and other analytics professionals to analyze growing volumes of structured transaction data, plus other forms of data that are often left untapped by conventional BI and analytics programs. This encompasses a mix of semi-structured and unstructured data -- for example, internet clickstream data, web server logs, social media content, text from customer emails and survey responses, mobile phone records, and machine data captured by sensors connected to the internet of things (IoT).
Big data analytics is a form of advanced analytics. TECHTARGET
Big data analytics is a form of advanced analytics, which has marked differences compared to traditional BI.
Big data analytics technologies and tools
Unstructured and semi-structured data types typically don't fit well in traditional data warehouses that are based on relational databases oriented to structured data sets. Further, data warehouses may not be able to handle the processing demands posed by sets of big data that need to be updated frequently or even continually, as in the case of real-time data on stock trading, the online activities of website visitors or the performance of mobile applications.
As a result, many of the organizations that collect, process and analyze big data turn to NoSQL databases, as well as Hadoop and its companion data analytics tools, including:
YARN: a cluster management technology and one of the key features in second-generation Hadoop.
MapReduce: a software framework that allows developers to write programs that process massive amounts of unstructured data in parallel across a distributed cluster of processors or stand-alone computers.
Spark: an open source, parallel processing framework that enables users to run large-scale data analytics applications across clustered systems.
HBase: a column-oriented key/value data store built to run on top of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
Hive: an open source data warehouse system for querying and analyzing large data sets stored in Hadoop files.
Kafka: a distributed publish/subscribe messaging system designed to replace traditional message brokers.
Pig: an open source technology that offers a high-level mechanism for the parallel programming of MapReduce jobs executed on Hadoop clusters.
How big data analytics works
In some cases, Hadoop clusters and NoSQL systems are used primarily as landing pads and staging areas for data before it gets loaded into a data warehouse or analytical database for analysis -- usually in a summarized form that is more conducive to relational structures.
More frequently, however, big data analytics users are adopting the concept of a Hadoop data lake that serves as the primary repository for incoming streams of raw data. In such architectures, data can be analyzed directly in a Hadoop cluster or run through a processing engine like Spark. As in data warehousing, sound data management is a crucial first step in the big data analytics process. Data being stored in the HDFS must be organized, configured and partitioned properly to get good performance out of both extract, transform and load (ETL) integration jobs and analytical queries.
Once the data is ready, it can be analyzed with the software commonly used for advanced analytics processes. That includes tools for:"

data mining, which sift through data sets in search of patterns and relationships;
predictive analytics, which build models to forecast customer behavior and other future developments;
machine learning, which taps algorithms to analyze large data sets; and
deep learning, a more advanced offshoot of machine learning.
Text mining and statistical analysis software can also play a role in the big data analytics process, as can mainstream business intelligence software and data visualization tools. For both ETL and analytics applications, queries can be written in MapReduce, with programming languages such as R, Python, Scala, and SQL, the standard languages for relational databases that are supported via SQL-on-Hadoop technologies.
Big data analytics uses and challenges
Big data analytics applications often include data from both internal systems and external sources, such as weather data or demographic data on consumers compiled by third-party information services providers. In addition, streaming analytics applications are becoming common in big data environments as users look to perform real-time analytics on data fed into Hadoop systems through stream processing engines, such as Spark, Flink and Storm.
Early big data systems were mostly deployed on premises, particularly in large organizations that collected, organized and analyzed massive amounts of data. But cloud platform vendors, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft, have made it easier to set up and manage Hadoop clusters in the cloud, as have Hadoop suppliers such as Cloudera-Hortonworks, which supports the distribution of the big data framework on the AWS and Microsoft Azure clouds. Users can now spin up clusters in the cloud, run them for as long as they need and then take them offline with usage-based pricing that doesn't require ongoing software licenses.
Big data has become increasingly beneficial in supply chain analytics. Big supply chain analytics utilizes big data and quantitative methods to enhance decision making processes across the supply chain. Specifically, big supply chain analytics expands datasets for increased analysis that goes beyond the traditional internal data found on enterprise resource planning (ERP) and supply chain management (SCM) systems. Also, big supply chain analytics implements highly effective statistical methods on new and existing data sources. The insights gathered facilitate better informed and more effective decisions that benefit and improve the supply chain.
Potential pitfalls of big data analytics initiatives include a lack of internal analytics skills and the high cost of hiring experienced data scientists and data engineers to fill the gaps.
Structured and unstructured data can be analyzed using big data analytics. TECHTARGET
Big data analytics involves analyzing structured and unstructured data.
Emergence and growth of big data analytics
The term big data was first used to refer to increasing data volumes in the mid-1990s. In 2001, Doug Laney, then an analyst at consultancy Meta Group Inc., expanded the notion of big data to also include increases in the variety of data being generated by organizations and the velocity at which that data was"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=117","Jan 30, 2020 10:07 AM","THEREALDEAL","being created and updated. Those three factors -- volume, velocity and variety -- became known as the 3Vs of big data, a concept Gartner popularized after acquiring Meta Group and hiring Laney in 2005.
Separately, the Hadoop distributed processing framework was launched as an Apache open source project in 2006, planting the seeds for a clustered platform built on top of commodity hardware and geared to run big data applications. By 2011, big data analytics began to take a firm hold in organizations and the public eye, along with Hadoop and various related big data technologies that had sprung up around it.
Initially, as the Hadoop ecosystem took shape and started to mature, big data applications were primarily the province of large internet and e-commerce companies such as Yahoo, Google and Facebook, as well as analytics and marketing services providers. In the ensuing years, though, big data analytics has increasingly been embraced by retailers, financial services firms, insurers, healthcare organizations, manufacturers, energy companies and other enterprises."

KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 10 — Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) should not look at huge investments as a hindrance for them to adopt Industry 4.0 (I4.0) as they had the option of starting small.
Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation Sdn Bhd (MDEC) data economy director Ir Dr Karl Ng Kah Hou said the SMEs could take the approach of prioritising which segment had the potential to be transformed first, towards helping to generate better productivity and efficiency.
“However, companies must understand that before adopting I4.0, they should first have data, not ‘big’ data, but quality data, which may come in different forms and volume, because without it, we cannot process any information, be it text, visual, voice, figures and so forth."

Big Data Technologies, The Buzz-word which you get to hear much in the recent days. In this article, We shall discuss the groundbreaking technologies which made Big Data spread its branches to reach greater heights.
What is Big Data Technology?
Big Data Technology can be defined as a Software-Utility that is designed to Analyse, Process and Extract the information from an extremely complex and large data sets which the Traditional Data Processing Software could never deal with.
We need Big Data Processing Technologies to Analyse this huge amount of Real-time data and come up with Conclusions and Predictions to reduce the risks in the future.
Now let us have a look at the Categories in which the Big Data Technologies are classified:
Types of Big Data Technologies:
Big Data Technology is mainly classified into two types:
Operational Big Data Technologies
Analytical Big Data Technologies
Firstly, The Operational Big Data is all about the normal day to day data that we generate. This could be the Online Transactions, Social Media, or the data from a Particular Organisation etc. You can even consider this to be a kind of Raw Data which is used to feed the Analytical Big Data Technologies.
A few examples of Operational Big Data Technologies are as follows:
Online ticket bookings, which includes your Rail tickets, Flight tickets, movie tickets etc.
Online shopping which is your Amazon, Flipkart, Walmart, Snap deal and many more.
Data from social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, what’s app and a lot more.
The employee details of any Multinational Company.
So, with this let us move into the Analytical Big Data Technologies.
Analytical Big Data is like the advanced version of Big Data Technologies. It is a little complex than the Operational Big Data. In short, Analytical big data is where the actual performance part comes into the picture and the crucial real-time business decisions are made by analyzing the Operational Big Data.
Few examples of Analytical Big Data Technologies are as follows:
Stock marketing
Carrying out the Space missions where every single bit of information is crucial.
Weather forecast information.
Medical fields where a particular patients health status can be monitored.
Let us have a look at the top Big Data Technologies being used in the IT Industries.
Top Big Data Technologies
Top big data technologies are divided into 4 fields which are classified as follows:
Data Storage
Data Mining
Data Analytics
Data Visualization
Now let us deal with the technologies falling under each of these categories with their facts and capabilities, along with the companies which are using them."

Google is reportedly trialing a new subscription plan for Photos that would require Google's AI to select 10 images from your collection to print and send to you via postal mail.
Late last week, 9to5Google indicated that Google has begun trialing a new monthly service to which Photos users can subscribe to get prints of their best photos by mail of the previous 30 days - as selected by the platform's artificial intelligence.
According to the site, which first reported the news on Jan 31, customers in the United States can sign up to receive 10 4×6in photos printed on matte, white cardstock for US$7.99 per month. The images will be selected automatically by Google's AI which will determine which pictures capture a user's ""best memories"" from the past month.
Though Google will choose the collection of photos, users will be able to pick one out of three themes for the series: people and pets, mostly landscapes, or a little bit of everything.
This is the latest offer by Google to give users a physical version of content that's typically only viewed in a digital format nowadays. Back in 2017, the company gave customers the opportunity to create soft and hardcover photo books, and last year, canvas prints were made available.
As of now, the subscription is being trialed by invitation. Depending on the results of this test, the subscription could roll out more widely later this year."

Money can be a pretty sweet deal; it can provide you with an exciting lifestyle, glorious things, sometimes a little happiness. The catch? Sometimes there isn’t enough money to go around—and it can only buy you happiness to a certain extent.
And since there are no trees growing free cash, no dollar bills raining from the sky into our purses and wallets, most of us live in a world of budgets. But, the good thing is, when you take control of your money, you take control of your life, too.
“There is a gigantic difference between earning a great deal of money and being rich.”"

All Goldman Sachs' 1MDB bond sale cases will now be heard at High Court
KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 5): All Goldman Sachs cases in relation to 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) bond sales that were previously charged at the magistrates' court will now be heard at the High Court.
This follows High Court Justice Mohamed Zaini Mazlan today allowing the prosecution's application led by deputy public prosecutor Aaron Chelliah to transfer all the cases, including the one involving Goldman Sachs (Singapore) Pte Ltd which had reportedly hit a snag, to the High Court.
However, it remains to be seen which High Court judge would be hearing the case.
Goldman Sachs were represented by lawyers Hisyam Teh Poh Teik, Datuk Prem Ramachandran and Chethan Jethwani.
All parties will now go to the magistrates court to inform the magistrate over the transfer of the case.
It was previously reported that Goldman Sachs (Singapore) Ptd Ltd's notice of summons was not able to be served resulting in the delay.
With this, Goldman Sachs International based in New York, and its entities in United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Singapore have been served proper notices of summons.
In December 2018, Malaysia filed four charges against Goldman Sachs for allegedly leaving out material facts on the sale of bonds between a subsidiary of 1MDB and Aabar Investment PJS Ltd.
The offences were allegedly committed at 1MDB’s premises at Menara IMC in Jalan Sultan Ismail here between March 19, 2012, and Nov 11, 2013.
The company was charged under Section 179(c) of the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007, which carries a penalty of imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years and a fine of not less than RM1 million, upon conviction.
Former Goldman Sachs banker Roger Ng Chong Hwa had also claimed trial to four counts of abetting the company, in reference to the sale of the same bonds by omitting material facts and making false statements.
The US Department of Justice has estimated that about US$4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB between 2009 and 2014."

Smart cities help citizens reduce waste and energy consumption and connected sensors are even used in farming to help monitor crop and cattle yields and predict growth patterns.
As such, IoT is one of the most important technologies of everyday life and it will continue to pick up steam as more businesses realize the potential of connected devices to keep them competitive.
Benefits of IoT
The internet of things offers a number of benefits to organizations, enabling them to:
Monitor their overall business processes;
Improve the customer experience;
Save time and money;
Enhance employee productivity;
Integrate and adapt business models;
Make better business decisions; and
Generate more revenue.
IoT encourages companies to rethink the ways they approach their businesses, industries and markets and gives them the tools to improve their business strategies.
Pros and cons of IoT
Some of the advantages of IoT include:
Ability to access information from anywhere at any time on any device;
Improved communication between connected electronic devices;
Transferring data packets over a connected network saves time and money;
Automating tasks helps improve the quality of a business’ services and reduces the need for human intervention.
Some disadvantages of IoT include:
As the number of connected devices increases and more information is shared between devices, the potential that a hacker could steal confidential information also increases;
Enterprises may eventually have to deal with massive numbers -- maybe even millions -- of IoT devices and collecting and managing the data from all those devices will be challenging.
If there’s a bug in the system, it’s likely that every connected device will become corrupted;
Since there’s no international standard of compatibility for IoT, it’s difficult for devices from different manufacturers to communicate with each other.
IoT standards and frameworks
There are several emerging IoT standards, including:
6LoWPAN (IPv6 over Low -Power Wireless Personal Area Networks), an open standard defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The 6LoWPAN standard enables any low-power radio to communicate to the internet, including 804.15.4, Bluetooth Low Energy and Z-Wave (for home automation).
ZigBee0, a low-power, low data-rate wireless network used mainly in industrial settings. ZigBee is based on based the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. The ZigBee Alliance created Dotdot, the universal language for IoT that enables smart objects to work securely on any network and understand each other.
LiteOS, a Unix-like operating system for wireless sensor networks. LiteOS supports smartphones, wearables, intelligent manufacturing applications, smart homes and Internet of Vehicles (IoV). The operating system also serves as a smart device development platform.
OneM2M, a machine-to-machine service layer that can be embedded in software and hardware to connect devices. The global standardization body, OneM2M, was created to develop reusable standards to enable IoT applications across different verticals to communicate.
DDS (Data Distribution Service) was developed by the Object Management Group (OMG) and is an IoT standard for real-time, scalable and high-performance machine-to-machine communication.
AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol), an open source published standard for asynchronous messaging by wire. AMQP enables encrypted and interoperable messaging between organizations and applications. The protocol is used in client/server messaging and in IoT device management.
CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol), a protocol designed by the IETF that specifies how low-power compute-constrained devices can operate in the internet of things.
LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network), a protocol for wide area networks, it’s designed to support huge networks, such as smart cities, with millions of low-power devices.
IoT frameworks include:"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=118","Feb 5, 2020 10:38 AM","THEREALDEAL","AWS IoT, a cloud platform for IoT released by Amazon. This framework is designed to enable smart devices to easily connect and securely interact with the AWS cloud and other connected devices.
ARM Mbed IoT, a platform to develop apps for the IoT based on ARM microcontrollers. The goal of the ARM Mbed IoT platform is to provide a scalable, connected and secure environment for IoT devices by integrating Mbed tools and services.
Microsoft’s Azure IoT Suite, a platform that consists of a set of services that enables users to interact with and receive data from their IoT devices as well as perform various operations over data, such as multidimensional analysis, transformation and aggregation, and visualize those operations in a way that’s suitable for business.
Google’s Brillo/Weave, a platform for the rapid implementation of IoT applications. The platform consists of two main backbones: Brillo, an android-based operating system for the development of embedded low power devices; and Weave, IoT-oriented communication protocol that serves as the communication language between the device and the cloud.
Calvin, an open source IoT platform released by Ericsson designed for building and managing distributed applications that enable devices talk to each other. Calvin includes a development framework for application developers as well as a runtime environment for handling the running application.
Consumer and enterprise IoT applications
There are numerous real-world applications of the internet of things, ranging from consumer IoT and enterprise IoT to manufacturing and industrial IoT (IIoT). IoT applications span numerous verticals, including automotive, telecom and energy.
In the consumer segment, for example, smart homes that are equipped with smart thermostats, smart appliances and connected heating, lighting and electronic devices can be controlled remotely via computers and smartphones.
Wearable devices with sensors and software can collect and analyze user data, sending messages to other technologies about the users with the aim of making users' lives easier and more comfortable. Wearable devices are also used for public safety -- for example, improving first responders' response times during emergencies by providing optimized routes to a location or by tracking construction workers' or firefighters' vital signs at life-threatening sites.
In healthcare, IoT offers many benefits, including the ability to monitor patients more closely to use the data that's generated and analyze it. Hospitals often use IoT systems to complete tasks such as inventory management, for both pharmaceuticals and medical instruments.
Smart buildings can, for instance, reduce energy costs using sensors that detect how many occupants are in a room. The temperature can adjust automatically -- for example, turning the air conditioner on if sensors detect a conference room is full or turning the heat down if everyone in the office has gone home.
In agriculture, IoT-based smart farming systems can help monitor, for instance, light, temperature, humidity and soil moisture of crop fields using connected sensors. IoT is also instrumental in automating irrigation systems.
In a smart city, IoT sensors and deployments, such as smart streetlights and smart meters, can help alleviate traffic, conserve energy, monitor and address environmental concerns and improve sanitation."

The internet of things connects billions of devices to the internet and involves the use of billions of data points, all of which need to be secured. Due to its expanded attack surface, IoT security and IoT privacy are cited as major concerns.
In 2016, one of the most notorious recent IoT attacks was Mirai, a botnet that infiltrated domain name server provider Dyn and took down many websites for an extended period of time in one of the biggest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks ever seen. Attackers gained access to the network by exploiting poorly secured IoT devices.
Because IoT devices are closely connected, all a hacker has to do is exploit one vulnerability to manipulate all the data, rendering it unusable. Manufacturers that don't update their devices regularly -- or at all -- leave them vulnerable to cybercriminals.
Additionally, connected devices often ask users to input their personal information, including names, ages, addresses, phone numbers and even social media accounts -- information that's invaluable to hackers.
However, hackers aren't the only threat to the internet of things; privacy is another major concern for IoT users. For instance, companies that make and distribute consumer IoT devices could use those devices to obtain and sell users' personal data.
Beyond leaking personal data, IoT poses a risk to critical infrastructure, including electricity, transportation and financial services.
The future of IoT
There is no shortage of IoT market estimations. For example, a few include:
Bain & Company expects annual IoT revenue of hardware and software to exceed $450 billion by 2020.
McKinsey & Company estimates IoT will have an $11.1 trillion impact by 2025.
IHS Markit believes the number of connected IoT devices will increase 12% annually to reach 125 billion in 2030.
Gartner assesses that 20.8 billion connected things will be in use by 2020, with total spend on IoT devices and services to reach $3.7 trillion in 2018."

TOKYO: Japan's first robot bartender has begun serving up drinks in a Tokyo pub in a test that could usher in a wave of automation in restaurants and shops struggling to hire staff in an ageing society.
The repurposed industrial robot serves drinks in is own corner of a Japanese pub operated by restaurant chain Yoronotaki. An attached tablet computer face smiles as it chats about the weather while preparing orders.
The robot, made by the company QBIT Robotics, can pour a beer in 40 seconds and mix a cocktail in a minute. It uses four cameras to monitors customers to analyse their expressions with artificial intelligence (AI) software.
""I like it because dealing with people can be a hassle. With this you can just come and get drunk,"" Satoshi Harada, a restaurant worker said after ordering a drink.
""If they could make it a little quicker it would be even better.""
Finding workers, especially in Japan's service sector, is set to get even more difficult.
The government has eased visa restrictions to attract more foreign workers but companies still face a labour shortage as the population shrinks and the number of people over 65 increases to more than a third of the total.
Service companies that can't relocate overseas or take advantage of automation are more vulnerable than industrial firms. In health care alone, Japan expects a shortfall of 380,000 workers by 2025.
Japan wants to use the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games beginning on July 27 to showcase service robot technology, with organisers planning to use robots built by Toyota Motor and Panasonic Corp to help visitors, workers and athletes.
The robot bartender trial at the pub, which employs about 30 people, will last two months after which Yoronotaki will assess the results.
""We hope it's a solution,"" Yoshio Momiya, a Yoronotaki manager, said as the robot bartender served drinks behind him.
""There are still a number of issues to work through, such as finding enough space for it, but we hope it will be something we can use.""
At about 9 million yen , the robot costs as much as employing a human bartender for three years."

Timeline: The long road to Trump's impeachment and trial
WASHINGTON - The U.S. Senate was poised on Wednesday to acquit President Donald Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
Here is a look at the road to his impeachment and trial.
MUELLER REPORT
In July 2017, two little-known Democrats in the House of Representatives make the first attempt to impeach Trump, basing it on investigations into Moscow's interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.
They file formal charges known as articles of impeachment, alleging that Trump obstructed justice by firing FBI head James Comey to hinder the Russia investigation by then Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
After a two-year probe, Mueller finds insufficient evidence of a criminal conspiracy involving Trump and draws no conclusions on whether Trump obstructed justice.
Little comes of this impeachment effort. In 2019 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the leading Democrat in Congress, says Trump is ""just not worth it.""
WHISTLEBLOWER
On Aug. 12, 2019, an anonymous intelligence official files a whistleblower complaint about a phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. According to a summary of the call later released by the White House, Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate both former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, a Democrat running for president in 2020, and a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind 2016 election meddling.
IMPEACHMENT INVESTIGATION
Amid further reports of Trump's dealings with Ukraine, Pelosi on Sept. 24 accuses Trump of urging a foreign power to intervene in the 2020 election and announces an impeachment investigation in the Democratic-controlled House.
In testimony at televised hearings, U.S. diplomats and officials describe a pressure campaign organised by Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to get Ukraine to announce the Biden investigation. Trump's freezing of $391 million in aid to Ukraine was part of the campaign, according to some testimony.
TRUMP'S DEFENCE
Trump says he was just trying to get Kiev to quash corruption and points to the fact that the Ukrainian investigations never happened as evidence that the July call was innocent. Republican lawmakers say that even if Trump's conduct was not perfect, it does not belong in the category of ""high crimes and misdemeanours"" stipulated in the U.S. Constitution as a reason to impeach a president.
IMPEACHED
On Dec. 18 Trump becomes only the third U.S. president to be impeached when the Democratic-led House approves two articles of impeachment charging him with abuse of power and obstructing Congress.
THE TRIAL
The Senate puts Trump on trial in late January. The outcome seems in little doubt, as Republicans dominate the chamber where a two-thirds majority is needed to convict and remove the president. No Republican expresses a desire to find Trump guilty.
WITNESSES
The two parties tussle over Democrats' attempts to introduce new witnesses and documents to the trial. They are especially keen to hear from former national security adviser John Bolton who had disparaged efforts by Trump allies to influence Ukraine as ""a drug deal.""
THE BOLTON FACTOR
The New York Times reports that Bolton, a foreign policy hawk who has served previous Republican administrations, has written a book in which he says Trump told him he had wanted to continue freezing the aid to Ukraine to pressure Zelenskiy to help with investigations into Democrats, including Biden. The revelation contradicts Trump's defence. It puts pressure on a handful of moderate Republican senators to join Democrats and vote to call Bolton and White House officials as witnesses. But a majority of senators vote to reject new witnesses.
TRUMP DEFENCE
Trump lawyer Alan Dershowitz says at the trial that senators cannot impeach a president for doing anything to try to win re-election if the president believes that to be in the public interest.
Democrats and constitutional experts severely criticize this defence, saying it gives U.S. presidents huge new powers not foreseen in the Constitution. Dershowitz says later his remarks were deliberately misinterpreted."

BUSAN, Nov 25 — Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said the government intends to develop Malaysia to be part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0) and use modern technology to its advantage.
Speaking at the ASEAN-South Korea Commemorative Summit here today, Dr Mahathir said among the most promising industries in Malaysia is Information Technology (IT) and new technologies.
“We may be behind many others but we intend to catch up.
“We need to educate from young where they are more familiar with the new values, the new strategy of doing things and new kinds of businesses,” he told a full house session moderated by Yoon Sung Woon of Bain and Company.
The local partner of the global management firm also asked Dr Mahathir on policy changes brought about by the new government as well as the country’s transformation plans.
The premier said Malaysia has always been welcoming towards foreign countries and investors, and this is still relevant despite the change in the government.
However, he said, the government now is strict about combating corruption and does not accept any discrepancies in financial management.
“We still welcome foreign investors,” he said, adding that the fastest way to develop is by inviting foreign investment and acquiring technology.
The CEO Dialogue session, organised by the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry, is held in conjunction with the two-day summit which begins today with a leaders’ welcoming dinner.
Later, the prime minister visited the Malaysian Pavilion at the Invest ASEAN Exhibition held in conjunction with the summit.
Malaysian exhibitors participating at this event are MIDA, MATRADE, Invest Selangor, Halal Development Corporation, Usaha Strategik Sdn Bhd (USSB), We Build Easy Sdn Bhd and Tourism Malaysia Seoul.
It is expected to receive 10,000 visitors.
Dr Mahathir was briefed by USSB, which produces biomass pellet from oil palm empty fruit bunch.
Its executive director Za’im Hadi Meskam said the prime minister was interested in how the local company developed the product.
USSB initially collaborated with a German company to acquire technology to produce energy pellets from biowaste but later switched to a technology partner from China.
“About 60 per cent of the technology was developed locally and our product is now used by an industrial boiler in Johor,” he said."

Positive: Profit jumped. No borrowings. Current liabilities 1 million. Very high profit margin. Still well supported by some, etc.
Negative: Unbelievable high current assets of 77 million (no big deal to produce the amount of profit) but no aging of receivables. High profit without dividend is as good as no profit.

Industry 4.0 is the digital transformation of manufacturing/production and related industries and value creation processes. Industrie 4.0 has been defined as the current trend of automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies, including cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing and artificial intelligence in creating the smart factory.
Industry 4.0 is a vision that evolved from an initiative to make the German manufacturing industry more competitive (‘Industrie 4.0’) to a globally adopted term referring to industrial transformation in discrete and process manufacturing.
Industry 4.0 is the evolution to cyber-physical systems, representing the fourth industrial revolution on the road to an end-to-end value chain with Industrial IoT and decentralized intelligence in manufacturing
Industry 4.0 is often used interchangeably with the notion of the fourth industrial revolution.
It is characterized by, among others, 1) even more automation than in the third industrial revolution, 2) the bridging of the physical and digital world through cyber-physical systems, enabled by Industrial IoT, 3) a shift from a central industrial control system to one where smart products define the production steps, 4) closed-loop data models and control systems and 4) personalization/customization of products. The goal is to enable autonomous decision-making processes, monitor assets and processes in real-time, and enable equally real-time connected value creation networks through early involvement of stakeholders, and vertical and horizontal integration.
Industry 4.0 is a vision and concept in motion, with reference architectures, standardization and even definitions in flux. Most Industry 4.0 initiatives are early-stage projects with a limited scope. The majority of digitization and digitalization efforts, in reality, happen in the context of third and even second industrial revolution technologies/goals.
In essence, the technologies making Industry 4.0 possible leverage existing data and ample additional data sources, including data from connected assets to gain efficiencies on multiple levels, transform existing manufacturing processes, create end-to-end information streams across the value chain and realize new services and business models."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=119","Feb 7, 2020 3:42 PM","THEREALDEAL","To understand Industry 4.0, it is essential to see the full value chain which includes suppliers and the origins of the materials and components needed for various forms of smart manufacturing, the end-to-end digital supply chain and the final destination of all manufacturing/production, regardless of the number of intermediary steps and players: the end customer.
Enabling more direct models of personalized production, servicing, as well as customer/consumer interaction (including gaining real-time data from actual product usage) and cutting the inefficiencies, irrelevance and costs of intermediaries in a digital supply chain model, where possible, are some goals of Industry 4.0 in this customer-centric sense of increasingly demanding customers who value speed, (cost) efficiencies and value-added innovative services.
In the end, it remains business – with the innovative twist of innovation and transformation of business models and processes: increase profit, decrease costs, enhance customer experience, optimize customer lifetime value and where possible customer loyalty, sell more, and innovate to grow and remain relevant."

KUALA LUMPUR: Information technology firm ARB Bhd, formerly known as ATURMAJU RESOURCES BHD posted a net profit of RM12.8mil in the last quarter ended Dec 31, 2019.
This boosted its full year earnings to RM34.77mil, or 12 sen a share.
The company, in a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, said its improved results in the last quarter was driven by its IT business.
The group's timber business has ceased operations during the quarter under review.
""For IT segment, the wholly-owned subsidiary ARB Development Sdn Bhd. has entered a joint venture agreement in fourth quarter of 2019 which is expected to contribute positive future earnings for the group,"" it said.
ARB is principally involved in reselling of customised enterprise resource planning (ERP) software system, and Internet of Things, internet and multimedia development, as well as consultancy services."

AS we cross the threshold of a brand new year, we are hurtling fast towards a future that increasingly resembles those depicted in sci-fi movies, with worlds that are increasingly enriched with integrated advanced technology in everyday lives.
Already many of these imagined technologies have already made headway within this decade – cars today are equipped with sensors that assist in driving and we have access to vast amounts of data, right on hand-held devices.
An accumulation of an ongoing tide of industrial revolutions going back to the invention of steam machinery in 18th century Britain, today’s Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR4.0) is “blurring the distinction among physical, digital and biological spaces, ” as mentioned in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry’s (MITI) national policy called “Industry4WRD”.
The new revolution is set to change how products will be designed, made, used and operated. Maintaining and servicing these new products will also evolve, affecting how operations, processes, supply chain management and energy footprints in factories are utilised.
Nine Strong Pillars
Most industries worldwide look to the Boston Consulting Group’s (BCG) delineation of nine areas that will be affected by IR4.0. These include the processing of big data, the further advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, increasing use of simulations.
Aided by use of cloud technology, technology will be more horizontally and vertically integrated, enabling Internet of Things (IoT), additive manufacturing, integration of augmented reality and cyber security to police against abuse.
While sweeping changes transform industries worldwide, IR4.0 should ultimately be instilled in those who will be affected – the country’s future crop of graduates coming out of the various academic institutions.
Ready for the future
At the forefront of this new wave, is one of Malaysia’s premier private universities, Asia Pacific University of Technology & Innovation (APU). It concentrates on providing a unique fusion of technology, innovation and creativity in preparing graduates for significant roles in business and society globally.
APU innovates by reviewing, developing and delivering programmes that are versatile, current and future-proof. By aligning its framework according to the Nine Pillars, it prepares its students for the impending revolution, through programmes that pivot on technology."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=120","Feb 10, 2020 9:19 AM","THEREALDEAL","The framework covers IoT, data science, cyber security, cloud computing, AI or intelligent systems, mechatronics, e-business, digital marketing, financial technology (fintech) and mobile technology.
The university also observes the policies outlined in MITI’s Industry4WRD. These key areas are also developed to address the need for talents to transform Malaysia’s Digital Economy. The Industry4WRD policies focus on developing and implementing the right technological infrastructure to allow industries to undergo seamless digital transformation processes.
As an education institution, teaching and learning infrastructure and facilities within APU provide students a comfortable ecosystem for development, where they also receive instruction on the Nine Pillars.
The university is equipped with world-class infrastructures from France, Singapore, Germany, the United Kingdom, among others that allow students to gain hands-on experience, and exposure to real-time data and scenarios – to emerge as competent technology professionals under a real-world environment.
Once such facility at APU is the Cyber Security Talent Zone (CSTZ), which is also Malaysia’s first integrated cyber security talent zone. It houses a military-grade real-time cyber security monitoring software at the full-fledged Cyber Threats Simulation and Response Centre and Security Operations Centre, where students gain real-life exposure and practical experience.
APU nurtures creativity and innovation through its discussion spaces, think tanks, incubation zones and Innovation Labs on its Technology Park Malaysia (TPM), Bukit Jalil campus – which provides an out-of-classroom environment for students.
While its research centres provide students fruits for thought in robotics engineering, IoT, data analytics, forensic and cyber security, business digitisation and innovation, entrepreneurship and leadership.
APU also provides professional transformation by providing platforms for students to formulate world-changing ideas and develop innovative solutions for complex problems faced by industries undergoing digital transformation.
Moulding Job-ready Individuals
One crucial element that can never be replaced by increased mechanisation is of course the human touch. This takes the form of soft skills that are always welcomed by customers in any industry, and hence are qualities that employers look out for.
Students who graduate with this added potential are deemed industry-ready by most employers as they leave their academic institutions. In fact, surveys show that employers value these soft skills, which include communication skills, problem-solving skills, openness to learn and to gain new knowledge.
Such qualities are inculcated at APU for these skills are constantly nurtured on a day-to-day basis.
In addition, the university’s campus environment is home to international students from over 120 countries, offering local students the chance to mingle with a global community.
This is important as events such as the celebration of various countries’ independence days, multicultural nights and other cultural celebrations help instill a global outlook in APU students, encouraging understanding and respect for other nationalities and moulding them as effective communicators in tomorrow’s global economy.
IR4.0 adoption and development also calls for deeper critical-thinking skills. So to complement its world-class facilities, APU developed innovative teaching and learning methods that produce graduates who can think critically, act innovatively and communicate ideas effectively."

Such international exposures ensure APU graduates are open to differences in opinions, and they are also well-trained to engage in global conversations, international strategies, and multicultural encounters. In essence, they become confident and are highly employable.
All APU students also go through industry-advised, strategically designed curriculums that stress on innovation and advanced digital technologies and automation, readying them for complex, dialectical opportunities once they graduate.
To ensure its graduates are professional and highly employable, APU builds students’ confidence through practical workplace skills within the curriculum. Eventually, once they graduate, they are workplace-ready – a fact that is demonstrated by its students who are professionally attired, even on-campus.
To-date, APU graduates have impressed over 10,000 industrial partners and potential employers, and over 40,000 alumni are employed globally in reputable multinational companies such as Accenture, HP, IBM, Huawei Technologies, Astro, Maybank, Standard Chartered and more.
Building the IR4.0 Workforce
A university plays an important role in future-proofing school leavers and transforming them into industry-ready graduates in collaboration with the industry.
Through APU’s industry-academia partnership with various companies, the university can identify, recognise and mitigate any risk that IR4.0 may pose for its graduates, ensuring they stay competitive against the tide of increasing automation and machines.
To do that, APU formalises ties with various key industry players, in a partnership that involves an entire ecosystem of academic content development and delivery.
This includes regular programme reviews, joint certification and open internship and job opportunities for APU students.
Some of APU’s significant industry partners include:
IBM, which APU collaborated with to deliver a series of technical workshops, technology talks, industry visits, and more. This received overwhelming participation from APU students. The university has so far produced over 200 students as IBM certified solution designers and application developers.
SAS, which endorses APU’s undergraduate and postgraduate level programmes in data science by providing tools and educational material support for learning and research purposes. All APU data science graduates receive a Joint Professional Certificate from SAS upon completion.
Microsoft, which has been an APU industrial partner for over two decades. APU is one of the frontier universities on the Microsoft Talent Development programme. APU students engage directly with Microsoft professionals through workshops and talk sessions and many of them also attained professional Microsoft certification, which allows for greater job prospects. APU has also received the Microsoft Azure Educator Grant Award.
APU students have also won national- and international-level competitions organised by major industry players, such as FAMELab, Intel-CREST Industry-University Challenge, NASA Space Apps Challenge, World Asian Business Case Competition, SAS FinTech Challenge and more.
Students at APU are fully-prepared to join the future global workforce with confidence, not just for their first jobs, but for lifelong careers."

2019 Novel Coronavirus
Symptoms
For confirmed 2019-nCoV infections, reported illnesses have ranged from people with mild symptoms to people being severely ill and dying. Symptoms can include:
Fever
Cough
Shortness of breath
CDC believes at this time that symptoms of 2019-nCoV may appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 after exposure. This is based on what has been seen previously as the incubation period of MERS viruses."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=120","Feb 11, 2020 10:49 AM","THEREALDEAL","Prevention & Treatment
There is currently no vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus. However, as a reminder, CDC always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including:
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Stay home when you are sick.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.
Follow CDC’s recommendations for using facemask.
CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear facemask to protect themselves from respiratory viruses, including 2019-nCoV.
Facemask should be used by people who show symptoms of 2019 novel coronavirus, in order to protect others from the risk of getting infected. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).
Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.
For information about handwashing, see CDC’s Handwashing website
For information specific to healthcare, see CDC’s Hand Hygiene in Healthcare Settings
These are everyday habits that can help prevent the spread of several viruses. CDC does have specific guidance for travelers."

What is Industry 4.0 and Why is it Important?
We’re in the midst of a significant transformation regarding the way we produce products thanks to the digitization of manufacturing. This compelling transition is called Industry 4.0 – which is a representation of the fourth revolution that has occurred in manufacturing. Like the three industrial revolutions which preceded it – steam power, mass production/electricity, digital age – Industry 4.0 will transform local and global economies and create a new future for us all.
Industry 4.0 Applications Today
While many organizations might still be in denial about Industry 4.0 and how it can impact their operations, many others have already started implementation and preparing for the future so that smart machines can improve their business.
Here are a Few Possible Applications
Connected machines collect a tremendous volume of data that can inform quality performance and many other issues as well as analyze data to identify patterns and insights that would be impossible for a human to do in a reasonable timeframe. Industry 4.0 gives manufacturers the ability for quick optimization, allowing efficiency by knowing what needs attention. By using data from sensors in its equipment, an African gold mine identified problems with the oxygen levels during leaching. Once fixed they were able to increase their yield by 3.7%, which saved them $20 million annually, according to McKinsey & Company.
Taking Industry 4.0 to a Whole New Level
Let’s take a watch for example: Before IoT, a watch was just a simple device that told time. Now we have smart watches, like the Apple Watch, that are connected to the Internet and have multiple sensors, tracking fitness and collecting other health-oriented data for us to use. IoT is redefining how people interact with objects and how they manage day-to-day tasks.
Industry 4.0 takes this concept to a whole new level – the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and cyber-physical systems. Connecting the factory floor to IIoT software allows humans and machines to communicate with one another and work as one unified team. With Industry 4.0 manufacturers can gather real-time data from all parts of the manufacturing process so decisions can be made quickly and efficiently; and automate and streamline processes, reducing waste and increasing productivity and Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE).
The massive amount of accurate data that is obtained in real time from IIoT-outfitted machinery creates an evidence-based environment, allowing manufacturers to make informed decisions more confidently and quickly.
These insights are paramount to successful manufacturing in a global economy. Tracking production from start to finish ensures that all raw materials and finished goods meet regulatory standards and are of the highest quality. If a problem arises, the source can be discovered in near real-time, reducing material waste and the risk of catastrophic recalls.
Adding Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to the Mix
Predictive analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are also changing how many businesses and industries operate, including manufacturing. By using machine learning techniques and AI, developers can create prediction models based on data from systems with IIoT.
Algorithmic solutions can benefit manufacturers by predicting the quality of their finished goods at the start of the production process, in order to increase the chances of producing a Golden Batch EVERY time.
Data can be analyzed to predict how well machinery is running at all times. Problems with machinery can then be detected and fixed much faster, leading to fewer stoppages and increased output. The activities of the operators and supervisors on each production line can also be taken into account, their output measured and predicted, leading to increased productivity and a more efficient factory floor."

Big Data: Types of Data Used in Analytics
Data types involved in Big Data analytics are many: structured, unstructured, geographic, real-time media, natural language, time series, event, network and linked. It is necessary here to distinguish between human-generated data and device-generated data since human data is often less trustworthy, noisy and unclean.
Structured data: data stored in rows and columns, mostly numerical, where the meaning of each data item is defined. This type of data constitutes about 10% of the today’s total data and is accessible through database management systems. Example sources of structured (or traditional) data include official registers that are created by governmental institutions to store data on individuals, enterprises and real estates; and sensors in industries that collect data about the processes. Today, sensor data is one of the fast growing areas, particularly that sensors are installed in plants to monitor movement, temperature, location, light, vibration, pressure, liquid and flow.
Unstructured data: data of different forms like e.g. text, image, video, document, etc. It can also be in the form of customer complaints, contracts, or internal emails. This type of data accounts for about 90% of the data created in this century. In fact, the volcanic growth of social media (e.g. Facebook and Twitter), since the middle of the last decade, is responsible for the major part of the unstructured data that we have today. Unstructured data cannot be stored using traditional relational databases. Storing data with such a variety and complexity requires the use of adequate storage systems, commonly referred to as NoSQL databases, like e.g. MongoDB and CouchDB. The importance of unstructured data is located in the embedded interrelationships that may not be discovered if other types of data are considered. What makes data generated in social media different from other types of data is that data in social media has a personal taste.
Geographic data: data related to roads, buildings, lakes, addresses, people, workplaces, and transportation routes, that are generated from geographic information systems. These data link between place, time, and attributes (i.e. descriptive information). Geographic data, which is digital, have huge benefits over traditional data sources such as maps, such as paper maps, written reports from explorers, and spoken accounts in that digital data are easy to copy, store, and transmit. More importantly, they are easy to transform, process, and analyze. Such data is useful in urban planning and for monitoring environmental effects. A branch of statistics that is involved in spatial or spatiotemporal data is called Geostatistics."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=121","Feb 13, 2020 8:38 AM","THEREALDEAL","Real-time media: real-time streaming of live or stored media data. A special characteristic of real-time media is the amount of data being produced which will be more confusing in the future in terms of storage and processing. One of the main sources of media data is services like e.g. YouTube, Flicker, and Vimeo that produce a huge amount of video, pictures, and audio. Another important source or real-time media is video conferencing (or visual collaboration) which allow two or more locations to communicate simultaneously in two-way video and audio transmission.
Natural language Data: human-generated data, particularly in the verbal form. Such data differ in terms of the level of abstraction and level of editorial quality. The sources of natural language data include speech capture devices, land phones, mobile phones, and Internet of Things that generate large sizes of text-like communication between devices.
Time series: a sequence of data points (or observations), typically consisting of successive measurements made over a time interval. The goal is to detect trends and anomalies, identify context and external influences, and compare individual against the group or compare individual at different times. There are two kinds of time series data: (i) continuous, where we have an observation at every instant of time and (ii) where we have an observation at (usually regularly) spaced intervals. Examples of such data include ocean tides, counts of sunspots, the daily closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and measuring the level of unemployment each month of the year.
Event data: data generated from the matching between external events with time series. This requires the identification of important events from the unimportant. For example, information related to vehicle crashes or accidents can be collected and analyzed to help understand what the vehicles were doing before, during and after the event. The data in this example is generated by sensors fixed in different places of the vehicle body. Event data consists of three mains pieces of information: (i) action, which is the event itself, (ii) timestamp, the time when this event happened, and (iii) state, which describes all other information relevant to this event. Event data is usually described as rich, denormalized, nested and schemaless.
Network data: data concerns very large networks, such as social networks (e.g. Facebook and Twitter), information networks (e.g. the World Wide Web), biological networks (e.g. biochemical, ecological and neural networks), and technological networks (e.g. the Internet, telephone and transportation networks). Network data is represented as nodes connected via one or more types of relationship. In social networks, nodes typically represent people. In information networks, nodes represent data items (e.g. webpages). In technological networks, nodes may represent Internet devices (e.g. routers and hubs) or telephone switches. In biological networks, nodes may represent neural cells. Much of the interesting work here is on network structure and connections between network nodes.
Linked data: data that is built upon standard Web technologies such as HTTP, RDF, SPARQL and URIs to share information that can be semantically queried by computers (rather than serving human needs). This allows data from different sources to be connected and read. The term was coined by Tim Berners-Lee, director of the World Wide Web Consortium, in a design note about the Semantic Web project. This project allowed the Web to connect related data that wasn’t linked in the past by providing the mechanisms and lowering the barriers to linking data currently linked.

There are four types of influenza viruses: A, B, C and D. Human influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal epidemics of disease (known as the flu season) almost every winter in the United States. Influenza A viruses are the only influenza viruses known to cause flu pandemics, i.e., global epidemics of flu disease. A pandemic can occur when a new and very different influenza A virus emerges that both infects people and has the ability to spread efficiently between people. Influenza type C infections generally cause mild illness and are not thought to cause human flu epidemics. Influenza D viruses primarily affect cattle and are not known to infect or cause illness in people.
Influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on two proteins on the surface of the virus: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). There are 18 different hemagglutinin subtypes and 11 different neuraminidase subtypes (H1 through H18 and N1 through N11, respectively). While there are potentially 198 different influenza A subtype combinations, only 131 subtypes have been detected in nature. Current subtypes of influenza A viruses that routinely circulate in people include: A(H1N1) and A(H3N2). Influenza A subtypes can be further broken down into different genetic “clades” and “sub-clades.” See the “Influenza Viruses” graphic below for a visual depiction of these classifications."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=121","Feb 15, 2020 9:36 AM","THEREALDEAL","Clades and sub-clades can be alternatively called “groups” and “sub-groups,” respectively. An influenza clade or group is a further subdivision of influenza viruses (beyond subtypes or lineages) based on the similarity of their HA gene sequences. (See the Genome Sequencing and Genetic Characterization page for more information). Clades and subclades are shown on phylogenetic trees as groups of viruses that usually have similar genetic changes (i.e., nucleotide or amino acid changes) and have a single common ancestor represented as a node in the tree (see Figure 1). Dividing viruses into clades and subclades allows flu experts to track the proportion of viruses from different clades in circulation.
Note that clades and sub-clades that are genetically different from others are not necessarily antigenically different (i.e., viruses from a specific clade or sub-clade may not have changes that impact host immunity in comparison to other clades or sub-clades).
Currently circulating influenza A(H1N1) viruses are related to the pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus that emerged in the spring of 2009 and caused a flu pandemic (CDC 2009 H1N1 Flu website). This virus, scientifically called the “A(H1N1)pdm09 virus,” and more generally called “2009 H1N1,” has continued to circulate seasonally since then. These H1N1 viruses have undergone relatively small genetic changes and changes to their antigenic properties (i.e., the properties of the virus that affect immunity) over time.
Of all the influenza viruses that routinely circulate and cause illness in people, influenza A(H3N2) viruses tend to change more rapidly, both genetically and antigenically. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses have formed many separate, genetically different clades in recent years that continue to co-circulate.
Influenza B viruses are not divided into subtypes, but instead are further classified into two lineages: B/Yamagata and B/Victoria. Similar to influenza A viruses, influenza B viruses can then be further classified into specific clades and sub-clades. Influenza B viruses generally change more slowly in terms of their genetic and antigenic properties than influenza A viruses, especially influenza A(H3N2) viruses. Influenza surveillance data from recent years shows co-circulation of influenza B viruses from both lineages in the United States and around the world. However, the proportion of influenza B viruses from each lineage that circulate can vary by geographic location."

One influenza A(H1N1), one influenza A(H3N2), and one or two influenza B viruses (depending on the vaccine) are included in each season’s influenza vaccines. Getting a flu vaccine can protect against flu viruses that are like the viruses used to make vaccine. Information about this season’s vaccine can be found at Preventing Seasonal Flu with Vaccination. Seasonal flu vaccines do not protect against influenza C or D viruses. In addition, flu vaccines will NOT protect against infection and illness caused by other viruses that also can cause influenza-like symptoms. There are many other viruses besides influenza that can result in influenza-like illness (ILI) that spread during flu season."

Big Data: Types of Data Used in Analytics
Data types involved in Big Data analytics are many: structured, unstructured, geographic, real-time media, natural language, time series, event, network and linked. It is necessary here to distinguish between human-generated data and device-generated data since human data is often less trustworthy, noisy and unclean.
Structured data: data stored in rows and columns, mostly numerical, where the meaning of each data item is defined. This type of data constitutes about 10% of the today’s total data and is accessible through database management systems. Example sources of structured (or traditional) data include official registers that are created by governmental institutions to store data on individuals, enterprises and real estates; and sensors in industries that collect data about the processes. Today, sensor data is one of the fast growing areas, particularly that sensors are installed in plants to monitor movement, temperature, location, light, vibration, pressure, liquid and flow.
Unstructured data: data of different forms like e.g. text, image, video, document, etc. It can also be in the form of customer complaints, contracts, or internal emails. This type of data accounts for about 90% of the data created in this century. In fact, the volcanic growth of social media (e.g. Facebook and Twitter), since the middle of the last decade, is responsible for the major part of the unstructured data that we have today. Unstructured data cannot be stored using traditional relational databases. Storing data with such a variety and complexity requires the use of adequate storage systems, commonly referred to as NoSQL databases, like e.g. MongoDB and CouchDB. The importance of unstructured data is located in the embedded interrelationships that may not be discovered if other types of data are considered. What makes data generated in social media different from other types of data is that data in social media has a personal taste.
Geographic data: data related to roads, buildings, lakes, addresses, people, workplaces, and transportation routes, that are generated from geographic information systems. These data link between place, time, and attributes (i.e. descriptive information). Geographic data, which is digital, have huge benefits over traditional data sources such as maps, such as paper maps, written reports from explorers, and spoken accounts in that digital data are easy to copy, store, and transmit. More importantly, they are easy to transform, process, and analyze. Such data is useful in urban planning and for monitoring environmental effects. A branch of statistics that is involved in spatial or spatiotemporal data is called Geostatistics.
Real-time media: real-time streaming of live or stored media data. A special characteristic of real-time media is the amount of data being produced which will be more confusing in the future in terms of storage and processing. One of the main sources of media data is services like e.g. YouTube, Flicker, and Vimeo that produce a huge amount of video, pictures, and audio. Another important source or real-time media is video conferencing (or visual collaboration) which allow two or more locations to communicate simultaneously in two-way video and audio transmission."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=121","Feb 17, 2020 12:52 PM","THEREALDEAL","Natural language Data: human-generated data, particularly in the verbal form. Such data differ in terms of the level of abstraction and level of editorial quality. The sources of natural language data include speech capture devices, land phones, mobile phones, and Internet of Things that generate large sizes of text-like communication between devices.
Time series: a sequence of data points (or observations), typically consisting of successive measurements made over a time interval. The goal is to detect trends and anomalies, identify context and external influences, and compare individual against the group or compare individual at different times. There are two kinds of time series data: (i) continuous, where we have an observation at every instant of time and (ii) where we have an observation at (usually regularly) spaced intervals. Examples of such data include ocean tides, counts of sunspots, the daily closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and measuring the level of unemployment each month of the year.
Event data: data generated from the matching between external events with time series. This requires the identification of important events from the unimportant. For example, information related to vehicle crashes or accidents can be collected and analyzed to help understand what the vehicles were doing before, during and after the event. The data in this example is generated by sensors fixed in different places of the vehicle body. Event data consists of three mains pieces of information: (i) action, which is the event itself, (ii) timestamp, the time when this event happened, and (iii) state, which describes all other information relevant to this event. Event data is usually described as rich, denormalized, nested and schemaless.
Network data: data concerns very large networks, such as social networks (e.g. Facebook and Twitter), information networks (e.g. the World Wide Web), biological networks (e.g. biochemical, ecological and neural networks), and technological networks (e.g. the Internet, telephone and transportation networks). Network data is represented as nodes connected via one or more types of relationship. In social networks, nodes typically represent people. In information networks, nodes represent data items (e.g. webpages). In technological networks, nodes may represent Internet devices (e.g. routers and hubs) or telephone switches. In biological networks, nodes may represent neural cells. Much of the interesting work here is on network structure and connections between network nodes.
Linked data: data that is built upon standard Web technologies such as HTTP, RDF, SPARQL and URIs to share information that can be semantically queried by computers (rather than serving human needs). This allows data from different sources to be connected and read. The term was coined by Tim Berners-Lee, director of the World Wide Web Consortium, in a design note about the Semantic Web project. This project allowed the Web to connect related data that wasn’t linked in the past by providing the mechanisms and lowering the barriers to linking data currently linked. Examples of repositories for linked data include (i) DBpedia, a dataset containing extracted data from Wikipedia, (ii) GeoNames, RDF descriptions of more than 7,500,000 geographical features worldwide, (iii) UMBEL, a lightweight reference structure of 20,000 subject concept classes and their relationships derived from OpenCyc, and (iv) FOAF, friend of a friend, a dataset describing persons, their properties and relationships. Linked open data is another project that targets linked data with open content.
Finally, each data type has different requirements for analysis and poses different challenges. In principle, the interpretation of data is known but in practice, nobody has the full picture."

What is Industry 4.0? Here's A Super Easy Explanation For Anyone
We’re in the midst of a significant transformation regarding the way we produce products thanks to the digitization of manufacturing. This transition is so compelling that it is being called Industry 4.0 to represent the fourth revolution that has occurred in manufacturing. From the first industrial revolution (mechanization through water and steam power) to the mass production and assembly lines using electricity in the second, the fourth industrial revolution will take what was started in the third with the adoption of computers and automation and enhance it with smart and autonomous systems fueled by data and machine learning.
Even though some dismiss Industry 4.0 as merely a marketing buzzword, shifts are happening in manufacturing that deserves our attention.
Industry 4.0 optimizes the computerization of Industry 3.0
When computers were introduced in Industry 3.0, it was disruptive thanks to the addition of an entirely new technology. Now, and into the future as Industry 4.0 unfolds, computers are connected and communicate with one another to ultimately make decisions without human involvement. A combination of cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things and the Internet of Systems make Industry 4.0 possible and the smart factory a reality. As a result of the support of smart machines that keep getting smarter as they get access to more data, our factories will become more efficient and productive and less wasteful. Ultimately, it's the network of these machines that are digitally connected with one another and create and share information that results in the true power of Industry 4.0."

While many organizations might still be in denial about how Industry 4.0 could impact their business or struggling to find the talent or knowledge to know how to best adopt it for their unique use cases, several others are implementing changes today and preparing for a future where smart machines improve their business. Here are just a few of the possible applications:
Identify opportunities: Since connected machines collect a tremendous volume of data that can inform maintenance, performance and other issues, as well as analyze that data to identify patterns and insights that would be impossible for a human to do in a reasonable timeframe, Industry 4.0 offers the opportunity for manufacturers to optimize their operations quickly and efficiently by knowing what needs attention. By using the data from sensors in its equipment, an African gold mine identified a problem with the oxygen levels during leaching. Once fixed, they were able to increase their yield by 3.7%, which saved them $20 million annually.
Optimize logistics and supply chains: A connected supply chain can adjust and accommodate when new information is presented. If a weather delay ties up a shipment, a connected system can proactively adjust to that reality and modify manufacturing priorities.
Autonomous equipment and vehicles: There are shipping yards that are leveraging autonomous cranes and trucks to streamline operations as they accept shipping containers from the ships.
Robots: Once only possible for large enterprises with equally large budgets, robotics are now more affordable and available to organizations of every size. From picking products at a warehouse to getting them ready to ship, autonomous robots can quickly and safely support manufacturers. Robots move goods around Amazon warehouses and also reduce costs and allow better use of floor space for the online retailer.
Additive manufacturing (3D printing): This technology has improved tremendously in the last decade and has progressed from primarily being used for prototyping to actual production. Advances in the use of metal additive manufacturing have opened up a lot of possibilities for production.
Internet of Things and the cloud: A key component of Industry 4.0 is the Internet of Things that is characterized by connected devices. Not only does this help internal operations, but through the use of the cloud environment where data is stored, equipment and operations can be optimized by leveraging the insights of others using the same equipment or to allow smaller enterprises access to technology they wouldn’t be able to on their own.
While Industry 4.0 is still evolving and we might not have the complete picture until we look back 30 years from now, companies who are adopting the technologies realize Industry 4.0's potential. These same companies are also grappling with how to upskill their current workforce to take on new work responsibilities made possible by Internet 4.0 and to recruit new employees with the right skills."

What Is Big Data?
Big data refers to the large, diverse sets of information that grow at ever-increasing rates. It encompasses the volume of information, the velocity or speed at which it is created and collected, and the variety or scope of the data points being covered. Big data often comes from multiple sources and arrives in multiple formats.
How Big Data Works
Big data can be categorized as unstructured or structured. Structured data consists of information already managed by the organization in databases and spreadsheets; it is frequently numeric in nature. Unstructured data is information that is unorganized and does not fall into a pre-determined model or format. It includes data gathered from social media sources, which help institutions gather information on customer needs.
Three Vs traditionally characterize big data: the volume (amount) of data, the velocity (speed) at which it is collected, and the variety of the info.
Big data can be collected from publicly shared comments on social networks and websites, voluntarily gathered from personal electronics and apps, through questionnaires, product purchases, and electronic check-ins. The presence of sensors and other inputs in smart devices allows for data to be gathered across a broad spectrum of situations and circumstances.
Big data is most often stored in computer databases and is analyzed using software specifically designed to handle large, complex data sets. Many software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies specialize in managing this type of complex data.
The Uses of Big Data
Data analysts look at the relationship between different types of data, such as demographic data and purchase history, to determine whether a correlation exists. Such assessments may be done in-house within a company or externally by a third-party who focuses on processing big data into digestible formats. Businesses often use the assessment of big data by such experts to turn it into actionable information.
Nearly every department in a company can utilize findings from data analysis, from human resources and technology to marketing and sales. The goal of big data is to increase the speed at which products get to market, to reduce the amount of time and resources required to gain market adoption, target audiences, and to ensure that customers remain satisfied.
KEY TAKEAWAYS
Big data is a great quantity of diverse information that arrives in increasing volumes and with ever-higher velocity.
Big data can be structured (often numeric, easily formatted, and stored) or unstructured (more free-form, less quantifiable).
Nearly every department in a company can utilize findings from big data analysis, but handling its clutter and noise can pose problems."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=122","Feb 19, 2020 9:35 AM","THEREALDEAL","Advantages and Disadvantages of Big Data
The increase in the amount of data available presents both opportunities and problems.
In general, having more data on one’s customers (and potential customers) should allow companies to better tailor their products and marketing efforts in order to create the highest level of satisfaction and repeat business. Companies that are able to collect a large amount of data are provided with the opportunity to conduct deeper and richer analysis.
While better analysis is a positive, big data can also create overload and noise. Companies have to be able to handle larger volumes of data, all the while determining which data represents signals compared to noise. Determining what makes the data relevant becomes a key factor.
Furthermore, the nature and format of the data can require special handling before it is acted upon. Structured data, consisting of numeric values, can be easily stored and sorted. Unstructured data, such as emails, videos, and text documents, may require more sophisticated techniques to be applied before it becomes useful."

The role of technology as a catalyst of continuous growth and transformation is irrefutable. From the first to the third industrial revolutions, technology has been at the centre of some monumental machine-driven inventions that led to extensive improvements across the globe. Technology is once again at its peak, as local industries find themselves at the brink of another imminent revolution – the Fourth Industrial Revolution, or more commonly known as IR4.0.
Recently, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir launched the “Industry Forward” (Industry4WRD) National Policy to position Malaysia as a primary hub for smart manufacturing and high-tech industries. By 2025, Industry4WRD is expected to raise the economic contribution of the manufacturing sector by 54% from US61bil to US$94bil.
In Malaysia, SMEs are urged to seize the myriad of opportunities bound to arise from this newest revolution. Some of the main examples of technology arising from IR4.0 include self-driving vehicles, delivery drones, and robotics for higher level of automation in manufacturing. While IR2.0 was focused on mass production and IR3.0 emphasised automation, IR4.0 is expected to modernise Malaysia’s industrial capability and transform our economy into a high-value manufacturer.
*Source: ResearchGate
A Boost from the Government & Corporates
Benefits of moving on to Industry 4.0 are aplenty; SMEs get to increase their productivity, flexibility, and efficiency, more rigorous R&D activities can be done, better quality of products can be made, and the potential of developing new homegrown talent are incredibly immense.
In order to assist SMEs to achieve this, the government has made available the Industry 4.0 Readiness Assessment (Industry4WRD-RA), a free online assessment to determine the type of assistance that organisations may need, including an allocation of RM210 million to facilitate this process. To qualify for these matching grants, the SMEs must adopt management- and operation-level recommendations from the exercise, such as improving the quality and skills of their workforce, promoting strategic collaborations to improve creation of smart technologies and business growth, and enhancing last mile connectivity in high impact areas.
Apart from the government, technology enablers like telco giant Celcom has introduced business solutions such as Celcom Cloud Secure which protects data in your emails and websites, and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Connected Services for real-time operational efficacy through IoT technology. These accessible solutions lower the barriers of entry for SMEs to run their businesses the IR4.0 way."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=122","Feb 20, 2020 8:41 PM","kenny chua","5G leads the way
A main vehicle in IR4.0 is 5G technology, which will significantly increase efficiency through a higher level of automation, cutting-edge robotics, data driven insight, and unprecedented global connectivity. To equip Malaysian SMEs to ride the 5G wave, the government has also budgeted a 5G ecosystem development grant worth RM50 million.
Recognising the importance of 5G empowerment, Celcom and fellow telecommunication heavyweight Maxis have come together for a collaboration that will enable both companies to explore possible business opportunities in key strategic areas to deliver the best 5G innovations that will benefit the people and businesses in Malaysia.
The possibilities are endless for SMEs with 5G – the high-speed connectivity will be able to meet the speed and connectivity that Internet of Things (IoT) demands, unlocking a treasure trove of opportunities for businesses. From IT, manufacturing, retail, transportation and education to health care, agriculture, and entertainment, almost every industry will be able to benefit from 5G connectivity to traverse the Industrial Revolution 4.0.
Powered by 5G, businesses will have a bigger sandbox to experiment in while leveraging on existing disruptive technologies such as drones, robotics, and artificial intelligence. Businesses can also expect to become more agile – personnel employed remotely will be able to communicate and collaborate with other colleagues more effectively, including seamless access to shared cloud data across enterprises.
The future is here
Nevertheless, in addition to 5G adoption and the Industry 4WRD National Policy grants, various other opportunities are also available under programmes such as the National IoT Strategic Roadmap and National Fiberisation and Connectivity Plan (NFCP) that SMEs should embrace to be ready for the demands of IR4.0. As of this year, about 20% of companies in the country have already migrated to IR4.0 while the rest of multinational companies and SMEs being expected to follow suit swiftly in successive years."

structured data in databases and data warehouses based on Structured Query Language (SQL);
unstructured data, such as text and document files held in Hadoop clusters or NoSQL database systems; and
semistructured data, such as web server logs or streaming data from sensors.
All of the various data types can be stored together in a data lake, which typically is based on Hadoop or a cloud object storage service. In addition, big data applications often include multiple data sources that may not otherwise be integrated. For example, a big data analytics project may attempt to gauge a product's success and future sales by correlating past sales data, return data and online buyer review data for that product.
Velocity refers to the speed at which big data is generated and must be processed and analyzed. In many cases, sets of big data are updated on a real- or near-real-time basis, instead of the daily, weekly or monthly updates made in many traditional data warehouses. Big data analytics applications ingest, correlate and analyze the incoming data and then render an answer or result based on an overarching query. This means data scientists and other data analysts must have a detailed understanding of the available data and possess some sense of what answers they're looking for to make sure the information they get is valid and up to date.
Managing data velocity is also important as big data analysis expands into fields like machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), where analytical processes automatically find patterns in the collected data and use them to generate insights.
More characteristics of big data
Looking beyond the original 3Vs, data veracity refers to the degree of certainty in data sets. Uncertain raw data collected from multiple sources -- such as social media platforms and webpages -- can cause serious data quality issues that may be difficult to pinpoint. For example, a company that collects sets of big data from hundreds of sources may be able to identify inaccurate data, but its analysts need data lineage information to trace where the data is stored so they can correct the issues.
Bad data leads to inaccurate analysis and may undermine the value of business analytics because it can cause executives to mistrust data as a whole. The amount of uncertain data in an organization must be accounted for before it is used in big data analytics applications. IT and analytics teams also need to ensure that they have enough accurate data available to produce valid results."

Big data
Posted by: Margaret Rouse
WhatIs.com
Contributor(s): Bridget Botelho, Stephen J. Bigelow
Big data is a combination of structured, semistructured and unstructured data collected by organizations that can be mined for information and used in machine learning projects, predictive modeling and other advanced analytics applications.
Systems that process and store big data have become a common component of data management architectures in organizations. Big data is often characterized by the 3Vs: the large volume of data in many environments, the wide variety of data types stored in big data systems and the velocity at which the data is generated, collected and processed. These characteristics were first identified by Doug Laney, then an analyst at Meta Group Inc., in 2001; Gartner further popularized them after it acquired Meta Group in 2005. More recently, several other Vs have been added to different descriptions of big data, including veracity, value and variability.
Although big data doesn't equate to any specific volume of data, big data deployments often involve terabytes (TB), petabytes (PB) and even exabytes (EB) of data captured over time.
Importance of big data
Companies use the big data accumulated in their systems to improve operations, provide better customer service, create personalized marketing campaigns based on specific customer preferences and, ultimately, increase profitability. Businesses that utilize big data hold a potential competitive advantage over those that don't since they're able to make faster and more informed business decisions, provided they use the data effectively.
For example, big data can provide companies with valuable insights into their customers that can be used to refine marketing campaigns and techniques in order to increase customer engagement and conversion rates.
Furthermore, utilizing big data enables companies to become increasingly customer-centric. Historical and real-time data can be used to assess the evolving preferences of consumers, consequently enabling businesses to update and improve their marketing strategies and become more responsive to customer desires and needs.
Big data is also used by medical researchers to identify disease risk factors and by doctors to help diagnose illnesses and conditions in individual patients. In addition, data derived from electronic health records (EHRs), social media, the web and other sources provides healthcare organizations and government agencies with up-to-the-minute information on infectious disease threats or outbreaks.
In the energy industry, big data helps oil and gas companies identify potential drilling locations and monitor pipeline operations; likewise, utilities use it to track electrical grids. Financial services firms use big data systems for risk management and real-time analysis of market data. Manufacturers and transportation companies rely on big data to manage their supply chains and optimize delivery routes. Other government uses include emergency response, crime prevention and smart city initiatives."

Big data comes from myriad different sources, such as business transaction systems, customer databases, medical records, internet clickstream logs, mobile applications, social networks, scientific research repositories, machine-generated data and real-time data sensors used in internet of things (IoT) environments. The data may be left in its raw form in big data systems or preprocessed using data mining tools or data preparation software so it's ready for particular analytics uses.
Using customer data as an example, the different branches of analytics that can be done with the information found in sets of big data include the following:
Comparative analysis. This includes the examination of user behavior metrics and the observation of real-time customer engagement in order to compare one company's products, services and brand authority with those of its competition.
Social media listening. This is information about what people are saying on social media about a specific business or product that goes beyond what can be delivered in a poll or survey. This data can be used to help identify target audiences for marketing campaigns by observing the activity surrounding specific topics across various sources.
Marketing analysis. This includes information that can be used to make the promotion of new products, services and initiatives more informed and innovative.
Customer satisfaction and sentiment analysis. All of the information gathered can reveal how customers are feeling about a company or brand, if any potential issues may arise, how brand loyalty might be preserved and how customer service efforts might be improved.
Breaking down the Vs of big data
Volume is the most commonly cited characteristic of big data. A big data environment doesn't have to contain a large amount of data, but most do because of the nature of the data being collected and stored in them. Clickstreams, system logs and stream processing systems are among the sources that typically produce massive volumes of big data on an ongoing basis"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=122","Feb 21, 2020 10:46 AM","THEREALDEAL","Some data scientists also add value to the list of characteristics of big data. As explained above, not all data collected has real business value, and the use of inaccurate data can weaken the insights provided by analytics applications. It's critical that organizations employ practices such as data cleansing and confirm that data relates to relevant business issues before they use it in a big data analytics project.
Variability also often applies to sets of big data, which are less consistent than conventional transaction data and may have multiple meanings or be formatted in different ways from one data source to another -- factors that further complicate efforts to process and analyze the data. Some people ascribe even more Vs to big data; data scientists and consultants have created various lists with between seven and 10 Vs.
How big data is stored and processed
The need to handle big data velocity imposes unique demands on the underlying compute infrastructure. The computing power required to quickly process huge volumes and varieties of data can overwhelm a single server or server cluster. Organizations must apply adequate processing capacity to big data tasks in order to achieve the required velocity. This can potentially demand hundreds or thousands of servers that can distribute the processing work and operate collaboratively in a clustered architecture, often based on technologies like Hadoop and Apache Spark.
Achieving such velocity in a cost-effective manner is also a challenge. Many enterprise leaders are reticent to invest in an extensive server and storage infrastructure to support big data workloads, particularly ones that don't run 24/7. As a result, public cloud computing is now a primary vehicle for hosting big data systems. A public cloud provider can store petabytes of data and scale up the required number of servers just long enough to complete a big data analytics project. The business only pays for the storage and compute time actually used, and the cloud instances can be turned off until they're needed again."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=122","Feb 21, 2020 10:47 AM","THEREALDEAL","To improve service levels even further, public cloud providers offer big data capabilities through managed services that include the following:
Amazon EMR (formerly Elastic MapReduce)
Microsoft Azure HDInsight
Google Cloud Dataproc
In cloud environments, big data can be stored in the following:
Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS);
lower-cost cloud object storage, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3);
NoSQL databases; and
relational databases.
For organizations that want to deploy on-premises big data systems, commonly used Apache open source technologies in addition to Hadoop and Spark include the following:
YARN, Hadoop's built-in resource manager and job scheduler, which stands for Yet Another Resource Negotiator but is commonly known by the acronym alone;
the MapReduce programming framework, also a core component of Hadoop;
Kafka, an application-to-application messaging and data streaming platform;
the HBase database; and
SQL-on-Hadoop query engines, like Drill, Hive, Impala and Presto.
Users can install the open source versions of the technologies themselves or turn to commercial big data platforms offered by Cloudera, which merged with former rival Hortonworks in January 2019, or Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), which bought the assets of big data vendor MapR Technologies in August 2019. The Cloudera and MapR platforms are also supported in the cloud.
Big data challenges
Besides the processing capacity and cost issues, designing a big data architecture is another common challenge for users. Big data systems must be tailored to an organization's particular needs, a DIY undertaking that requires IT teams and application developers to piece together a set of tools from all the available technologies. Deploying and managing big data systems also require new skills compared to the ones possessed by database administrators (DBAs) and developers focused on relational software.
Both of those issues can be eased by using a managed cloud service, but IT managers need to keep a close eye on cloud usage to make sure costs don't get out of hand. Also, migrating on-premises data sets and processing workloads to the cloud is often a complex process for organizations.
Making the data in big data systems accessible to data scientists and other analysts is also a challenge, especially in distributed environments that include a mix of different platforms and data stores. To help analysts find relevant data, IT and analytics teams are increasingly working to build data catalogs that incorporate metadata management and data lineage functions. Data quality and data governance also need to be priorities to ensure that sets of big data are clean, consistent and used properly."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=122","Feb 21, 2020 10:48 AM","THEREALDEAL","Big data collection practices and regulations
For many years, companies had few restrictions on the data they collected from their customers. However, as the collection and use of big data have increased, so has data misuse. Concerned citizens who have experienced the mishandling of their personal data or have been victims of a data breach are calling for laws around data collection transparency and consumer data privacy.
The outcry about personal privacy violations led the European Union to pass the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which took effect in May 2018; it limits the types of data that organizations can collect and requires opt-in consent from individuals or compliance with other specified lawful grounds for collecting personal data. GDPR also includes a right-to-be-forgotten provision, which lets EU residents ask companies to delete their data.
While there aren't similar federal laws in the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) aims to give California residents more control over the collection and use of their personal information by companies. CCPA was signed into law in 2018 and is scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, 2020. In addition, government officials in the U.S. are investigating data handling practices, specifically among companies that collect consumer data and sell it to other companies for unknown use.
The human side of big data analytics
Ultimately, the value and effectiveness of big data depend on the workers tasked with understanding the data and formulating the proper queries to direct big data analytics projects. Some big data tools meet specialized niches and enable less technical users to use everyday business data in predictive analytics applications. Other technologies -- such as Hadoop-based big data appliances -- help businesses implement a suitable compute infrastructure to tackle big data projects, while minimizing the need for hardware and distributed software know-how.
Big data can be contrasted with small data, another evolving term that's often used to describe data whose volume and format can be easily used for self-service analytics. A commonly quoted axiom is that ""big data is for machines; small data is for people."""

U guys decide if u wanna buy high from Elaine. Her cost is only 1.5sen. U decide if u wanna pay her 10-15-20sen premium for her share and the trade receivables. Confident that they can collect the 40mil mar buy lo. Market cap 80mil, 40mil trade receivables, 25mil cash. Premium around 15mil. Beware that full exercise of ICPS will dilute the shares by 3-4X.
When people expose a scam, the scammer get agitate. And started name calling.
If you are not trying to scam, why are you so angry? Point out what's true about ARBB la.

i'm anticipating next quarter report, ARBB will pile up more trade receivables...
But to shut my mouth up, they will put in 10-15mil in cash but increase trade receivables by 30-50mil.
I think market is smart enough to see the highly dilutive ICPS and net operating cash loss.
So, to make money from ARBB, please get ARBB accounts to go collect hutang.
If can't collect hutang, it becomes hutang lapuk. Market aren't dumb enough to buy hutang lapuk.

Penang Skills Development Centre (PSDC) chief executive officer Muhamed Ali Hajah Mydin said the low figure could be attributed to lack of knowledge and proper channels to do so.
“We saw the prime minister (Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad) launching the IR4.0 blueprint last October.
“We saw a RM2 billion reserve (in last year’s budget) for the purpose, but people do not know how to access it.
“There is no structured information, for say if a company needs a RM1 million soft loan to upgrade.
“This is the reality, since October last year and now we are going to go for the next budget and we should expedite the move into IR4.0,” he said at a forum titled “Driving skills development for a future-ready workforce in Malaysia” here today.
Dr Mahathir launched the National Policy on Industry 4.0 last Oct to help companies, especially in the manufacturing industry, to migrate to IR 4.0 in a systematic and comprehensive manner.
However, an industry research firm, International Data Corporation (IDC), recently revealed that Malaysia’s future workforce was unprepared for IR 4.0.
Ali said 15 to 20 per cent of the Multinational companies moving to IR4.0 were tier one companies, which were forced to adapt as they had no other option.
The rest, he said, were still waiting for instructions as they were unsure about what to do.
“They are waiting for instructions. I don’t know who will distribute the funds,” he added.
Messe Worldwide Sdn Bhd sales director Foong Lai Lyn attributed the confusion to the fact that many agencies were taking the lead.
She proposed that an agency be set up to handle IR4.0 issues, to make it easier to provide information on what to do, what subsidies companies qualify for, and, if necessary, “hand-holding” such companies.
Industry 4.0 Malaysia Association president Raja Teagarajan said only 90 out of the 500 companies targeted by the government had received help for migration to IR4.0.
“We have about 500,000 companies, which are mostly small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
“We must find ways to expand the net,” he said.
SngEx Exhibitions Pte Ltd executive director James Boeyy said the same thing was taking place in the Asean region, where the small and medium enterprise sector was just beginning to adopt IR4.0.
He said it was important for the public and private sectors to support the ecosystem, for it to work.

Aware of the competitive value technology now drives — and the pressure to keep up with rivals — most executives set aside sizable budgets and resources to prepare their organization to transition into the age of Industry 4.0.
In this era, businesses are frequently investing to ‘get by’ and maintain pace with rivals, but few are seeing real returns from their digital investments. According to a new report that surveyed more than 2,000 C-suite global executives, issues, on the hole, likely come down to a lack of long-term planning.
While most organizations possess the capabilities required to thrive in Industry 4.0, a significant number of them do not have a complete grasp of what going digital entails, the technologies involved, and how to keep the momentum going. In fact, things are looking pretty scattered.
Ad-hoc approaches
According to the report, just 10 percent said that they had a comprehensive, long-term strategy in approaching Industry 4.0. Nearly half (47 percent) of respondents, meanwhile, said that Industry 4.0 was approached in an ad-hoc manner, and 21 percent do not have a formal strategy in place.
The problem is, that all too often organizations are building strategies around short-term gains at the expense of long-term returns, and they aren’t leveraging technologies boldly across all business operations. But survey data shows that organizations with holistic strategies are primed to do much better.
For example, 73 percent of organizations with a disciplined approach to strategy expressed confidence in surviving disruption, greatly surpassing those that have no or ad-hoc Industry 4.0 strategies (13 and 12 percent respectively).
They also benefit financially — approximately 90 percent reported a 5 percent annual revenue growth over the past year. Ultimately, myopic business mindsets have no place in Industry 4.0.
A wide-angle view
Leaders have to look beyond immediate profit when it comes to leveraging technology and pursue wider disruption in their own industries or organization, rather than just to drive high revenues and reduce costs in one area of the business.
That said, though, healthy market competition doesn’t mean industry members can’t benefit mutually from open innovation. Communication and information sharing with fellow industry players and technologists will help identify the current technological needs and investments required.
Of course, enabling tech means appointing the right talent, and businesses will also need a highly-skilled, resilient workforce for sustained Industry 4.0.
Currently, just 20 percent of respondents agree that their organization has the skills required to survive Industry 4.0.
In terms of investment priorities, 74 percent would invest in training and developing workforces, 59 percent would invest in understanding what skills are needed, and just 28 percent will focus on attracting and retaining new talent.
While getting a big break in the age of Industry 4.0 sounds like a mountain to climb, companies that double down will be rewarded for their efforts, building the muscle required to position their organizations at the leading pack in the coming years.

KUALA LUMPUR: Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad has indicated that the economic stimulus package will go ahead on a date to be announced by him in his capacity as the interim Prime Minister, said former finance minister Lim Guan Eng.
The plan, initially scheduled to be announced on Thursday, Feb 27, was among the issues that Lim discussed with Dr Mahathir this morning.
“I had met up with Dr Mahathir in the morning in his office to discuss political developments. Among the issues that happened to be discussed was the economic stimulus package that was planned to be announced by Dr Mahathir to react to the adverse global economic impact to Malaysia caused by the COVID-19 outbreak,” he said in a statement today.
Lim, who is the DAP Secretary-General and Member of Parliament for Bagan, said the Finance Ministry had finalised the economic stimulus package on Sunday, Feb 23 – his last full day as finance minister – to be presented to Dr Mahathir for his approval on the following day.
However, Dr Mahathir submitted his resignation as the seventh premier yesterday. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri’ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah, who accepted the resignation, reappointed Dr Mahathir as the country’s interim Prime Minister later in the day.
On the advice of Dr Mahathir, His Majesty also revoked the appointments of all ministers.
In a three-paragraph statement, the chief secretary to the government, Datuk Seri Mohd Zuki Ali, said during the interim period, Dr Mahathir would manage the country’s administration until the appointment of the new prime minister and the formation of a new cabinet.
Malaysia is not the only ASEAN nation planning a stimulus package to address concerns over COVID-19. Thailand’s Finance Ministry will be proposing a new economic stimulus package to the cabinet in mid-March.
Malaysia’s economic stimulus package, focusing on tourism, consumption and investment, is aimed at stimulating domestic travel, which has been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.--Bernama"

Professional service robots exist because of meteoric technological developments. Robots were mostly expected to be found on the production floor in factories. These days, they are in the service industry and delivering packages to homes.
In a few years, robots will be used in mainstream applications. They will also be used increasingly in commercial places around the globe. Commercial robotics includes robots such as the following:
Drones
Field robots
Autonomous guided robots
Medical robots
The market for commercial robots is expected to grow swiftly in the next few years. In fact, by the year 2021, the market is expected to hit a value of $37 billion (International Federation of Robotics).
Logistics robots are expected to lead the pack followed closely by defense robots and exoskeletons. The demand for PR robots is set to rise. The future looks bright for professional service robots.
Technical Setbacks
There a few technical challenges that interfere with the efficient implementation of professional service robots. Some of these include:
Vision to facilitate navigation
Cognition in order to interact better with humans
Dexterity to enhance control
Vision to Facilitate Navigation
The next chapter of professional service robots may be committed to advancing vision software. This will enable robots to steer across the workplace. Consequently, the automation of non-factory tasks will increase profitability.
Dexterity to Enhance Control
In like manner, it is important for a robot to demonstrate dexterity. Commercial robots are not locked away behind cages. They are free to move around and interact with humans. As a result, there must be an element of control in order to protect the humans around the robots.
In addition, robots involved in household and agricultural tasks must be programmed to be gentle. They could easily damage the products and objects they work on. Hence, they should be able to see what they are working with and also to handle them gently.
Cognition to Interact Better
Cognition is also important because commercial robots often interact with humans one-on-one. Some of these robots are designed to perform tasks such as customer service. This involves interacting directly with humans; speaking with them and giving assistance.
Consequently, robotics is always coming up with innovative ways to improve these robots. Programming is complex and is constantly being enhanced. Commercial robots of the future are likely to have increasingly natural-like interactions with their human clients.
There may be a few technical issues to deal with but improvement is gradual and will be realized. There is no doubt that the professional robot of tomorrow will demonstrate improved capabilities.
Technological Enhancements in Commercial Robots
There are additional technological advancements that will help to solve some huge barriers affecting commercial robots. These advancements will ensure that commercial robots find a place in the mainstream.
These technological improvements include the following:
VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization & Mapping)
This technology is mostly found in autonomous navigation. It allows the robot’s vision system to chart its surroundings and also find itself within those surroundings. VSLAM allows for path planning as well as autonomous navigation even in constantly changing environments.
Embedded Vision
This helps greatly with dexterity because a robot is able to stop operations if a human’s safety is threatened. It also helps robots to have a gentler grip in tasks such as food handling.
Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI as well as machine learning methods are utilized to train bots to work collaboratively with humans. The aim is to advance natural language processing for better human-robot interactions. Catching a human and a robot in conversation will be a normal sight.
Conclusion
Professional service robots will be an expected and common presence in non-factory industries. They will have advanced capabilities and will work well humans. With AI, humanoid robots and those engaged in PR can communicate reasonably with humans.
Moreover, they will be able to travel across the work floor without endangering the humans therein. Also, they will be able to handle delicate products better and help businesses to give better yields."

ARBB7181 technology, human capital, global trade and networks, and institutional frameworks as key drivers of production for Industry 4.0.
Malaysia’s ranking in each of these drivers emphasises priorities in technology, human capital and institutional frameworks (21st to 30th position out of 100
countries), consistent with some of the challenges highlighted previously
Technology adoption and diffusion are particularly important for SMEs and underscore
the importance of creating production networks and collaborations with MNCs and large
companies.
Human capital focus is key to creating an accelerated shift in productivity, especially as
Malaysia has been relying on low labour cost in the past, with a declining share of
skilled labour.
Strengthening institutional frameworks underpins the role of Government in creating the
right ecosystem and facilitating collaborative platforms.
On global trade and investment, Malaysia is already well-integrated into regional value
chains and exhibits a very good trade infrastructure, which is reflected in its strong
global ranking (7th).

Like an incoming wave stock prices move forward 3 feet then retrace backward 2 feet
The wave movements do not go in a straight line. So is stock prices.
During the Ogse bull run of Carimin, velesto, penergy, Uzma and Dayang prices moved up strongly and the retraced many times
But it moved higher and higher as Ogse job awards progressed
So these same patterns will be repeated in IR4.0 bull run
The power behind how far and how high each individual stocks can go depend on
1. The quantum of job awards
2. The profit margin it can show up in its balance sheet
3. Any special incentive to shareholders management might dish out.
So these can be expected in IR4.0 stocks in coming months and years as they garnered new found wealth...overflowing wealth from IR4.0 jobs like never before
Traders who are nimble and PRECISELY will do well.
Greed and fear will always be in play
But since we have a very very favorable wind we should unfurl our sail and catch the bull run for as long as it lasts

Malaysia’s strategic location made it one of the most important logistics destinations in the region in the past. Today, with the advent of IR4.0, it continues to leverage the same advantage to establish itself as a preferred logistics and e-commerce hub destination.
Besides its location, there are other factors in its favour, such as the availability of properties and incentives, a modern infrastructure, lower cost of doing business, huge market size in the region and digital readiness.
With large international retail brands setting up their national and regional distribution centres in Malaysia, its potential in IR4.0, especially in the logistics and e-commerce sectors, can be seen.
Nestlé’s national distribution centre at Axis Mega DC in Teluk Panglima Garang occupies the entire Phase 1, which has a built-up of 515,000 sq ft. Further to the west are the Ikea Regional DC in Pulau Indah Industrial Park, Klang, the Lazada Regional DC in Sepang and the Continental Tyres Regional DC in Kuala Selangor.
Advantages
Landserve Sdn Bhd managing director Chen King Hoaw tells City & Country that Malaysia’s 30 highways, five international airports and seven international seaports are linked to all major cities and growth centres in the country. Malaysia is also served by a telecommunications network of digital, fibre-optic and satellite technology, which is crucial to the industrial, logistics and e-commerce sectors.
“According to the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission’s 2018 statistics, there were 39.4 million broadband subscriptions in the country, and 3G and 4G/LTE network had expanded to reach 94.7% and 79.7% population coverage respectively, signifying that the nation is ready to take digital growth to a whole new level,” he says.
“Besides, Malaysia has one of the lowest rents for Grade A offices in Asia and is also rated as the least expensive Asean country to live in. Above all, it has political stability, established legal and ­financial systems with comparatively low tax rates.”
Datuk Jeffrey Ng, chairman of the Malaysian REIT Managers Association (MRMA) notes that the country’s developers and construction companies are experienced in developing industrial properties, and that capital is also available from investment funds and real estate investment trusts (REITs).
The country’s designated industrial zones also attract foreign industrial players to invest in duty-free import and export businesses as they can enjoy certain tax benefits. The industrial zones include Port of Tanjung Pelepas, Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone, Port Klang Free Zone and KLIA Aeropolis Digital Free Trade Zone in Sepang.
Ng adds that Malaysia allows up to 100% foreign ownership of businesses, and offers incentives for foreign direct investment.
“However, these advantages may not be unique to Malaysia, and it faces strong competition from regional players such as China, India and Vietnam. Thus, while Malaysia’s industry may be robust in certain areas such as petrochemicals, electrical and electronic manufacturing and agricultural-based products, the country has not achieved developed industrial status, owing to insufficient focus on innovation, automation, digitisation and technology,” he explains.
Challenges
Malaysia is facing challenges both internally and externally. Chen notes that Malaysian companies need to adapt to the rapid technological changes that affect the way businesses operate in order for Malaysia’s digital economy to prosper. Companies must embrace the changes to stay competitive.
“The Ministry of Communications and Multimedia, more particularly its Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) that was established in 1996, has been doing a great job by organising seminars in the country and abroad, and coming up with incentives and funding to promote the adoption of IR4.0,” he says.
Ng says talent, regulation, economies of scale and the lack of technology innovation are some of the challenges. He explains that there is a shortage of people skilled in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and insufficient focus on digital literacy and innovation, which result in a workforce that is less adaptable to fast-evolving technology.
Furthermore, he adds, red tape and, to some extent, perceived endemic corruption and abuse of power continue to weigh on multinational corporations and small and medium enterprises alike, dampening investments, innovation and industrial competitiveness. Certain industries, pending liberalisation and deregulation, continue to be tightly controlled by state-owned monopolies and government-linked companies, he says."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=128","Mar 2, 2020 6:11 PM","THEREALDEAL","“While the government has taken the effort to promote technical and vocational education and training, response remains slow, owing to a traditional mindset. Graduate unemployment and under-employment because of unsatisfactory wages, and racial and political issues have also resulted in a brain drain to other countries, reducing Malaysia’s competitiveness in high-tech, high-value industrial production,” Ng says.
“The lack of innovation may also be attributable to the higher interest costs compared with those in developed nations, which reduce business risk appetite, shortage of STEM talent, investment infrastructure and business ecosystem, limited local economies of scale and continued reliance on unskilled and semi-skilled foreign workers despite tightened work visa policies.”
Solutions
Chen says the challenges are the political uncertainty; the rising cost of doing business compared with other rapidly growing economies in the region such as Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar; Malaysian seaports’ inefficiency compared with some other ports in the region; and labour and talent shortage.
“To overcome the challenges, the government needs to focus on building the economy and continue to project Malaysia as a progressive yet friendly nation. It should ride the growth momentum resulting from the various initiatives introduced by MDEC to assist companies in their digital transformation journey,” he says
He suggests that Malaysia look into developing human resource programmes through collaboration with the local universities and government agencies to provide a semi-skilled and skilled workforce that is able to meet the requirements of the industry.
“Malaysia must put all the pieces together: overcoming the political and economic uncertainties, containing the rising cost, improving the efficiency at our seaports and airports, and building a vast pool of reliable workforce and talent that meets the requirements of industry players.”
Ng concurs, emphasising the importance of the development of human capital with an increased focus on STEM and digital literacy to boost the domestic talent pool and make it ready for IR4.0, alongside strict regulation and enforcement, innovation and technology as well as promoting further integration with Asean to benefit from the economies of scale and to access regional markets.
He notes that the government can seize the opportunity for Malaysia to become a major spot for the industrial sector by providing incentives for developers and REITs in developing land banks for the purpose of industrial developments as well as providing tax incentives for the relevant sectors.
“Malaysia occupies a unique position as a developing economy, where basic and digital infrastructure are already in place and human capital is more developed than that of its Southeast Asian peers,” he says.
“There is now high potential for the regeneration of old industrial sites. They can be redeveloped into modern, gated and guarded industrial parks, similar to the evolution of residential and commercial areas. These parks can be configured in standard formats or built-to-suit units to attract large local and multinational manufacturers to set up operations. In the long term, this will have the trickle-down effect of attracting the sub-contractors of these large manufacturers, who will prefer to be closely located to the supply chain.”"

What is Industry 4.0—the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)?
Industry 4.0 refers to a new phase in the Industrial Revolution that focuses heavily on interconnectivity, automation, machine learning, and real-time data. Industry 4.0, also sometimes referred to as IIoT or smart manufacturing, marries physical production and operations with smart digital technology, machine learning, and big data to create a more holistic and better connected ecosystem for companies that focus on manufacturing and supply chain management. While every company and organization operating today is different, they all face a common challenge—the need for connectedness and access to real-time insights across processes, partners, products, and people.
The world of manufacturing is changing. To survive and thrive now, you have to be willing to invest in Industry 4.0. This resource will help you get started.
Evolution of Industry from 1.0 to 4.0
Before digging too much deeper into the what, why, and how of Industry 4.0, it’s beneficial to first understand how exactly manufacturing has evolved since the 1800s. There are four distinct industrial revolutions that the world either has experienced or continues to experience today.
The First Industrial Revolution
The first industrial revolution happened between the late 1700s and early 1800s. During this period of time, manufacturing evolved from focusing on manual labor performed by people and aided by work animals to a more optimized form of labor performed by people through the use of water and steam-powered engines and other types of machine tools.
The Second Industrial Revolution
In the early part of the 20th century, the world entered a second industrial revolution with the introduction of steel and use of electricity in factories. The introduction of electricity enabled manufacturers to increase efficiency and helped make factory machinery more mobile. It was during this phase that mass production concepts like the assembly line were introduced as a way to boost productivity.
The Third Industrial Revolution
Starting in the late 1950s, a third industrial revolution slowly began to emerge, as manufacturers began incorporating more electronic—and eventually computer—technology into their factories. During this period, manufacturers began experiencing a shift that put less emphasis on analog and mechanical technology and more on digital technology and automation software.
The Fourth Industrial Revolution, or Industry 4.0
In the past few decades, a fourth industrial revolution has emerged, known as Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 takes the emphasis on digital technology from recent decades to a whole new level with the help of interconnectivity through the Internet of Things (IoT), access to real-time data, and the introduction of cyber-physical systems. Industry 4.0 offers a more comprehensive, interlinked, and holistic approach to manufacturing. It connects physical with digital, and allows for better collaboration and access across departments, partners, vendors, product, and people. Industry 4.0 empowers business owners to better control and understand every aspect of their operation, and allows them to leverage instant data to boost productivity, improve processes, and drive growth."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=128","Mar 3, 2020 9:18 AM","THEREALDEAL","Basic IIoT Concepts and Glossary of Terms
There are hundreds of concepts and terms that relate to IIoT and Industry 4.0, but here are 12 foundational words and phrases to know before you decide whether you want to invest in Industry 4.0 solutions for your business:
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP): Business process management tools that can be used to manage information across an organization.
IoT: IoT stands for Internet of Things, a concept that refers to connections between physical objects like sensors or machines and the Internet.
IIoT: IIoT stands for the Industrial Internet of Things, a concept that refers to the connections between people, data, and machines as they relate to manufacturing.
Big data: Big data refers to large sets of structured or unstructured data that can be compiled, stored, organized, and analyzed to reveal patterns, trends, associations, and opportunities.
Artificial intelligence (AI): Artificial intelligence is a concept that refers to a computer’s ability to perform tasks and make decisions that would historically require some level of human intelligence.
M2M: This stands for machine-to-machine, and refers to the communication that happens between two separate machines through wireless or wired networks.
Digitization: Digitization refers to the process of collecting and converting different types of information into a digital format.
Smart factory: A smart factory is one that invests in and leverages Industry 4.0 technology, solutions, and approaches.
Machine learning: Machine learning refers to the ability that computers have to learn and improve on their own through artificial intelligence—without being explicitly told or programmed to do so.
Cloud computing: Cloud computing refers to the practice of using interconnected remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process information.
Real-time data processing: Real-time data processing refers to the abilities of computer systems and machines to continuously and automatically process data and provide real-time or near-time outputs and insights.
Ecosystem: An ecosystem, in terms of manufacturing, refers to the potential connectedness of your entire operation—inventory and planning, financials, customer relationships, supply chain management, and manufacturing execution.
Cyber-physical systems (CPS): Cyber-physical systems, also sometimes known as cyber manufacturing, refers to an Industry 4.0-enabled manufacturing environment that offers real-time data collection, analysis, and transparency across every aspect of a manufacturing operation.
Now that you have a better understanding of some of the core concepts related to Industry 4.0, you’re ready to dig deeper into how smart manufacturing can revolutionize the way you run and grow your business.
Smart Manufacturing Use Cases
One of the best ways to understand the concept of smart manufacturing better is to think about how it could be applied to your business, or a business similar to your business. Here are three use cases that can help you understand the value of Industry 4.0 in a manufacturing operation:
1. Supply chain management and optimization—Industry 4.0 solutions give businesses greater insight, control, and data visibility across their entire supply chain. By leveraging supply chain management capabilities, companies can deliver products and services to market faster, cheaper, and with better quality to gain an advantage over less-efficient competitors.
2. Predictive maintenance/analytics—Industry 4.0 solutions give manufacturers the ability to predict when potential problems are going to arise before they actually happen. Without IoT systems in place at your factory, preventive maintenance happens based on routine or time. In other words, it’s a manual task. With IoT systems in place, preventive maintenance is much more automated and streamlined. Systems can sense when problems are arising or machinery needs to be fixed, and can empower you to solve potential issues before they become bigger problems. Predictive analytics allow companies to not just ask reactive questions like, “what has happened?,” or “why did it happen?,” but also proactive questions like, “what is going to happen,” and, “what can we do to prevent it from happening?” These type of analytics can enable manufacturers to pivot from preventive maintenance to predictive maintenance."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=128","Mar 3, 2020 9:19 AM","THEREALDEAL","3. Asset tracking and optimization—Industry 4.0 solutions help manufacturers become more efficient with assets at each stage of the supply chain, allowing them to keep a better pulse on inventory, quality, and optimization opportunities relating to logistics. With IoT in place at a factory, employees can get better visibility into their assets worldwide. Standard asset management tasks such as asset transfers, disposals, reclassifications, and adjustments can be streamlined and managed centrally and in real time.
The point of reviewing these use cases is to help you imagine and start thinking about how smart manufacturing could be integrated into your own organization. How do you actually decide if Industry 4.0 is right for you?
Who Is Industry 4.0 Right For?
How do you know when or if your business should invest in Industry 4.0?
If you’re able to check off most of the items on this list, it’s probably safe to start evaluating Industry 4.0 technology and solution providers and allocating the resources needed for deployment:
You’re in a particularly competitive industry with a lot of tech-savvy players
You’re having a hard time recruiting to fill vacant jobs at your organization
You want better visibility across your supply chain
You want to identify and address issues before they become bigger problems
You want to boost efficiency and profitability across your entire organization
You want everyone on your team to have informed, up-to-date, relevant views of production and business processes
You want richer and more timely analytics
You need help digitizing and making sense of information
You want to improve customer satisfaction and customer experience
You want to improve product quality or keep product quality intact
You want a more integrated enterprise resource planning system that spans not only inventory and planning, but also financials, customer relationships, supply chain management, and manufacturing execution
You want a consistent and flexible view of production and business operations tailored to specific areas or users in your organization
You want real-time insights that help you make better, faster decisions about your business each day"

Industry 4.0 spans the entire product life cycle and supply chain— design, sales, inventory, scheduling, quality, engineering, and customer and field service. Everyone shares informed, up-to-date, relevant views of production and business processes—and much richer and more timely analytics.
Here is a quick, non-exhaustive list of some of the benefits of adopting an Industry 4.0 model for your business:
It makes you more competitive, especially against disruptors like Amazon. As companies like Amazon continue to optimize logistics and supply chain management, you need to be investing in technology and solutions that help you improve and optimize your own operation. To stay competitive, you have to have the systems and processes in place to allow you to provide the same level of service (or better) to your customers and clients that they could be getting from a company like Amazon.
It makes you more attractive to the younger workforce. Companies that invest in modern, innovative Industry 4.0 technologies are better positioned to attract and retain new workers.
It makes your team stronger and more collaborative. Companies that invest in Industry 4.0 solutions can increase efficiency, boost collaboration between departments, enable predictive and prescriptive analytics, and allow people including operators, managers, and executives to more fully leverage real-time data and intelligence to make better decisions while managing their day-to-day responsibilities.
It allows you to address potential issues before they become big problems. Predictive analytics, real-time data, internet-connected machinery, and automation can all help you be more proactive when it comes to addressing and solving potential maintenance and supply chain management issues.
It allows you to trim costs, boost profits, and fuel growth. Industry 4.0 technology helps you manage and optimize all aspects of your manufacturing processes and supply chain. It gives you access to the real-time data and insights you need to make smarter, faster decisions about your business, which can ultimately boost the efficiency and profitability of your entire operation."

Budget 2020 as main trading catalysts for 4Q. On the back of improving optimism on trade war (amid the phase-1 deal between US and China), coupled with less austerity sounding Budget 2020 which market participants felt the change of tone vs. Budget 2019, we opine traders to lookout for sectors such as:- (i) Technology (automation, E&E and customized packaged investment incentives as well as weak ringgit ranging ~RM4.18/USD) (ii) Renewable energy (green investments tax allowance) (iii) Telecommunication (ongoing National Fiberisation and Connectivity Plan (NFCP initiatives) (iv) Construction (increased development expenditure by 2.4% YoY) (v) Tourism (to boost tourist arrivals to 30 million)
Time to scoop up some equities. In 4Q, we opine the slightly positive sounding Budget 2020 as well as window dressing in December (average 10-year December return: 1.98%) would be able to lift the broader market sentiment (although some earnings disappointment may surface in November). In addition, the earlier mentioned catalysts would bode well for stocks selections in 4Q.
Technology: We believe the broad technology sector will be benefiting under the Ir4.0 ,E&E, automation incentives,and iot, which could result in higher demand for ir4.0 industry moving forward; under this section we strongly recommend ARBB, ISTONE and KESM.
Power-related: With the increasing demand for rural electrification in Malaysia, PESTECH would be the favoured pick amid its power transmission infrastructure expertise. Meanwhile, for renewable energy stimulus, we like CYPARK.
Construction: Given the increase in development expenditure and potentially improving construction sector, we see precast goverment project and concrete manufacturers such as AGESON, OKA and KIMLUN to benefit from the initial stage of construction jobs.
Tourism: Under the Budget 2020, RM1.1bn was allocated for VMY2020, which the government intends to achieve 30m tourist arrivals. In this space, we like TUNEPRO for the Travel Insurance Play, Which Is a Proxy Towards Tourism Industry."

Bank Negara lowers OPR by 25bps to 2.5%
Tuesday, 03 Mar 2020 3:00 PM MYT
KUALA LUMPUR: The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of Bank Negara Malaysia decided to reduce the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) by 25 basis points to 2.50%.
It said the ceiling and floor rates of the corridor of the OPR are correspondingly reduced to 2.75% and 2.25%, respectively.
“The reduction in the OPR is intended to provide a more accommodative monetary environment to support the projected improvement in economic growth amid price stability. The MPC will continue to monitor and assess the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation,” Bank Negara said in a statement Tuesday.
The reduction in the OPR came largely in line with economists’ expectations. This is the second cut so far this year. In January, Bank Negara reduced the OPR by 25 basis points to 2.75% -- the lowest since 2011.
The central bank noted that global economic conditions have weakened in the recent period. The ongoing Covid-19 outbreak has disrupted production and travel activity, especially within the region.
This has also led to greater risk aversion, resulting in tighter financial conditions and a resurgence in financial market volatility. Downside risks to the global growth outlook have increased, particularly in the near term. However, a number of countries have implemented policy responses. With further anticipated policy measures, these actions are expected to mitigate the economic impact of Covid-19.
“The Malaysian economy grew at a moderate pace of 4.3% in 2019. Looking ahead, growth, particularly in the first quarter, will be affected by the Covid-19 outbreak primarily in the tourism-related and manufacturing sectors. The weakness in the agriculture sector is also likely to persist in the first quarter.
“For 2020, private and public sector activities will be supportive of growth. Household spending is expected to grow at a slower pace amid moderate employment and income growth. Investment activity is projected to record a modest recovery, underpinned by ongoing and new projects, both in the public and private sectors,” it said.
The 2020 economic stimulus package will also provide some support to economic activity. Although domestic growth is expected to gradually improve in the second half of the year, there are key downside risks, mainly stemming from the evolving nature and prolonged impact of the Covid-19 outbreak, and continued weakness in commodity-related sectors.
Bank Negara said in 2020, headline inflation is expected to average higher but remain modest. The trajectory of headline inflation will be dependent on global oil and commodity price developments and the timing of the lifting of the domestic retail fuel price ceilings.
Underlying inflation is expected to be more moderate, amid limited demand pressures despite the continued expansion in economic activity."

PETALING JAYA: Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim could have been appointed as prime minister had he decided to accept Umno leaders who are facing ongoing graft charges, says Setiawangsa PKR MP Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad.
However, Anwar decided against the idea, as the PKR president refused to betray the people's mandate just for premiership, said Nik Nazmi.
""Anwar told us that he could have been the PM with condition that he abandoned our Pakatan Harapan allies and accept the tainted leaders in Umno facing numerous corruption charges.
""But, he refused to betray the mandate of the people simply for the sake of obtaining the premiership,"" said Nik Nazmi in an Instagram post on Tuesday (March 3).
Acknowledging that the political turmoil last week was ""unfortunate"", Nik Nazmi said it nevertheless exposed leaders ""who are truly loyal and who betrayed the people's mandate"".
""Good riddance to bad rubbish. The people will not forget,"" he added.
The political crisis which erupted last week saw the demise of the Pakatan government and the appointment of Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin as Prime Minister.
It also saw the exit of 11 PKR MPs and 26 Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia MPs from Pakatan and the emergence of the Perikatan Nasional coalition of Bersatu, PAS, Barisan Nasional as the ruling coalition."

KUALA LUMPUR, March 4 — On trial for corruption that includes the multi-billion dollar 1MDB fraud, former Malaysian prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak said today that the fall of the government that ousted him meant he now expected an atmosphere more conducive to a fair hearing.
Najib was voted out in 2018 amid anger over corruption in the South-east Asian country, but the alliance that toppled him fell apart at the weekend amid turmoil following the resignation of 94-year-old Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.
Najib, 66, denies the charges against him and says they were politically motivated.
Mahathir has accused Najib’s United Malays National Organisation (Umno) of engineering a return to power so that its officials escape conviction in the 1MDB scandal.
When he took power for a second time two years ago, Mahathir accused Najib of playing a central role in the 1MDB scandal.
“I would expect that the atmosphere would be more conducive towards a fair trial,” Najib told Reuters in an interview at his mansion in an affluent neighbourhood of Kuala Lumpur before heading to his latest court appearance.
“I’m not alluding to anything, because there’s no conclusion to the trial... But hopefully, you know, I will get a fair trial,” he said.
New Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
Najib is facing five trials over the 1MDB scandal that stretched from Malaysia to the Middle East to Hollywood.
Billions missing
The US Department of Justice estimates US$4.5 billion (RM18.8 billion) was misappropriated from the 1MDB sovereign fund between 2009 and 2014. US and Malaysian authorities say over US$1 billion stolen from 1MDB flowed into Najib’s personal accounts.
Najib says he was misled by Malaysian financier Jho Low and other 1MDB officials, and that he will clear his name in court.
“I don’t want any undue manipulation or pressure put on the judge or judges for political reasons. And on the strength of the evidence, I’m more than happy to go through the court process,” he said, speaking in his spacious living room decked with gilt and crystal ornaments and giant arrangements of brightly coloured artificial flowers as well as family photos.
Malaysia has also accused Goldman Sachs of misleading investors over bond sales totalling US$6.5 billion that the bank helped raise for 1MDB. Three units of the bank have pleaded not guilty.
Najib criticised the investment bank, saying Goldman had been part of a system meant to safeguard Malaysian interests.
Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Najib, an Umno member of parliament, said he had not been directly involved in the deal between his party and some of Dr Mahathir’s allies that led to Dr Mahathir’s fall, but he had been consulted about terms of the agreement.
Strained relations
Dr Mahathir was replaced by his former ally Muhyiddin, who was himself sacked by Najib in 2015 after criticising his handling of 1MDB.
Najib said he had not spoken to Muhyiddin since he took office but he hoped to rebuild their relationship.
“I hope it’s water under the bridge,” he said, citing the example of the alliance between Dr Mahathir and his old rival Anwar Ibrahim, which won the 2018 election.
“Quite apart from jailing Anwar Ibrahim, his disparaging remarks about Anwar’s character over the years didn’t stop them from getting together,” Najib said of Dr Mahathir.
Najib, looking relaxed in a light beige suit and open white shirt, said he was not seeking a government post for now. He said the trial had strained his family, including his wife Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor, also on trial for corruption.
Away from court, Najib said he was meeting people around Malaysia and developing a more down-to-earth profile than was possible when he held the office that his father also once held.
He was also busy on social media, where he has the biggest following of any Malaysian politician.
“You know, last week my Facebook attracted 20 million engagements. Normally I get about 9.5 million a week,” Najib said. “And in terms of likes, I’m about 6,000 away from reaching 4 million. So, I mean, those are the figures, but I don’t shout about them.” — Reuters"

KUALA LUMPUR: The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has delayed the return to Malaysia of another US$240 million (RM1 billion) of recovered money allegedly stolen from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) sovereign fund, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday, with one citing political uncertainty.
Malaysia was plunged into turmoil when 94-year-old Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad quit on Feb 24.
He was replaced on Sunday by Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, whose coalition includes the former ruling party that was voted out in 2018 amid accusations of corruption over 1MDB.
The US Department of Justice says over US$4.5 billion was looted from the fund under Umno Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, who is now on trial for corruption.
Since 2016, the department has filed civil lawsuits seeking to seize about US$1.7 billion in assets allegedly bought with stolen 1MDB funds.
Last May, the United States began returning some of the recovered funds. The first instalment was nearly US$200 million.
The DOJ had initially been scheduled to return the next payment of recovered funds to Malaysia on Feb 19, but there were technical reasons the transfer did not happen, the two sources said.
The total amount was around RM1 billion, one source said.
But once Dr Mahathir resigned, it was decided to hold the payment due to uncertainty over what would happen next, one source said. The sources did not want to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media.
A DOJ spokesman declined to comment.
Malaysia’s finance ministry redirected questions to the Attorney General’s Chambers, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The sources said they were not aware of DOJ’s next steps.
The funds returned go into a special fund at Malaysia’s finance ministry and are meant to be used to pay 1MDB’s bondholders.
American and Malaysian investigators have said Najib received about US$1 billion of the stolen funds from 1MDB. He has pleaded not guilty and says he was misled by Malaysian financier Jho Low and other 1MDB officials.
It was only after Najib’s unexpected defeat in the 2018 elections that the 1MDB investigation was reopened in Malaysia and trials began.
Goldman Sachs and some of its executives are among the many charged for their role as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales that raised US$6.5 billion for 1MDB. Three units of Goldman have pleaded not guilty to charges.
Najib told Reuters this week that he expected an atmosphere more conducive to a fair hearing now that Dr Mahathir has gone.
Muhyiddin has not talked about the 1MDB cases but has vowed to fight graft.

Malaysia’s strategic location made it one of the most important logistics destinations in the region in the past. Today, with the advent of IR4.0, it continues to leverage the same advantage to establish itself as a preferred logistics and e-commerce hub destination.
Besides its location, there are other factors in its favour, such as the availability of properties and incentives, a modern infrastructure, lower cost of doing business, huge market size in the region and digital readiness.
With large international retail brands setting up their national and regional distribution centres in Malaysia, its potential in IR4.0, especially in the logistics and e-commerce sectors, can be seen.
Nestlé’s national distribution centre at Axis Mega DC in Teluk Panglima Garang occupies the entire Phase 1, which has a built-up of 515,000 sq ft. Further to the west are the Ikea Regional DC in Pulau Indah Industrial Park, Klang, the Lazada Regional DC in Sepang and the Continental Tyres Regional DC in Kuala Selangor.
Advantages
Landserve Sdn Bhd managing director Chen King Hoaw tells City & Country that Malaysia’s 30 highways, five international airports and seven international seaports are linked to all major cities and growth centres in the country. Malaysia is also served by a telecommunications network of digital, fibre-optic and satellite technology, which is crucial to the industrial, logistics and e-commerce sectors.
“According to the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission’s 2018 statistics, there were 39.4 million broadband subscriptions in the country, and 3G and 4G/LTE network had expanded to reach 94.7% and 79.7% population coverage respectively, signifying that the nation is ready to take digital growth to a whole new level,” he says.
“Besides, Malaysia has one of the lowest rents for Grade A offices in Asia and is also rated as the least expensive Asean country to live in. Above all, it has political stability, established legal and ­financial systems with comparatively low tax rates.”
Datuk Jeffrey Ng, chairman of the Malaysian REIT Managers Association (MRMA) notes that the country’s developers and construction companies are experienced in developing industrial properties, and that capital is also available from investment funds and real estate investment trusts (REITs).
The country’s designated industrial zones also attract foreign industrial players to invest in duty-free import and export businesses as they can enjoy certain tax benefits. The industrial zones include Port of Tanjung Pelepas, Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone, Port Klang Free Zone and KLIA Aeropolis Digital Free Trade Zone in Sepang.
Ng adds that Malaysia allows up to 100% foreign ownership of businesses, and offers incentives for foreign direct investment.
“However, these advantages may not be unique to Malaysia, and it faces strong competition from regional players such as China, India and Vietnam. Thus, while Malaysia’s industry may be robust in certain areas such as petrochemicals, electrical and electronic manufacturing and agricultural-based products, the country has not achieved developed industrial status, owing to insufficient focus on innovation, automation, digitisation and technology,” he explains.
Challenges
Malaysia is facing challenges both internally and externally. Chen notes that Malaysian companies need to adapt to the rapid technological changes that affect the way businesses operate in order for Malaysia’s digital economy to prosper. Companies must embrace the changes to stay competitive.
“The Ministry of Communications and Multimedia, more particularly its Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) that was established in 1996, has been doing a great job by organising seminars in the country and abroad, and coming up with incentives and funding to promote the adoption of IR4.0,” he says.
Ng says talent, regulation, economies of scale and the lack of technology innovation are some of the challenges. He explains that there is a shortage of people skilled in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and insufficient focus on digital literacy and innovation, which result in a workforce that is less adaptable to fast-evolving technology.
Furthermore, he adds, red tape and, to some extent, perceived endemic corruption and abuse of power continue to weigh on multinational corporations and small and medium enterprises alike, dampening investments, innovation and industrial competitiveness. Certain industries, pending liberalisation and deregulation, continue to be tightly controlled by state-owned monopolies and government-linked companies, he says."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=129","Mar 9, 2020 9:45 AM","THEREALDEAL","“While the government has taken the effort to promote technical and vocational education and training, response remains slow, owing to a traditional mindset. Graduate unemployment and under-employment because of unsatisfactory wages, and racial and political issues have also resulted in a brain drain to other countries, reducing Malaysia’s competitiveness in high-tech, high-value industrial production,” Ng says.
“The lack of innovation may also be attributable to the higher interest costs compared with those in developed nations, which reduce business risk appetite, shortage of STEM talent, investment infrastructure and business ecosystem, limited local economies of scale and continued reliance on unskilled and semi-skilled foreign workers despite tightened work visa policies.”
Solutions
Chen says the challenges are the political uncertainty; the rising cost of doing business compared with other rapidly growing economies in the region such as Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar; Malaysian seaports’ inefficiency compared with some other ports in the region; and labour and talent shortage.
“To overcome the challenges, the government needs to focus on building the economy and continue to project Malaysia as a progressive yet friendly nation. It should ride the growth momentum resulting from the various initiatives introduced by MDEC to assist companies in their digital transformation journey,” he says
He suggests that Malaysia look into developing human resource programmes through collaboration with the local universities and government agencies to provide a semi-skilled and skilled workforce that is able to meet the requirements of the industry.
“Malaysia must put all the pieces together: overcoming the political and economic uncertainties, containing the rising cost, improving the efficiency at our seaports and airports, and building a vast pool of reliable workforce and talent that meets the requirements of industry players.”
Ng concurs, emphasising the importance of the development of human capital with an increased focus on STEM and digital literacy to boost the domestic talent pool and make it ready for IR4.0, alongside strict regulation and enforcement, innovation and technology as well as promoting further integration with Asean to benefit from the economies of scale and to access regional markets.
He notes that the government can seize the opportunity for Malaysia to become a major spot for the industrial sector by providing incentives for developers and REITs in developing land banks for the purpose of industrial developments as well as providing tax incentives for the relevant sectors.
“Malaysia occupies a unique position as a developing economy, where basic and digital infrastructure are already in place and human capital is more developed than that of its Southeast Asian peers,” he says.
“There is now high potential for the regeneration of old industrial sites. They can be redeveloped into modern, gated and guarded industrial parks, similar to the evolution of residential and commercial areas. These parks can be configured in standard formats or built-to-suit units to attract large local and multinational manufacturers to set up operations. In the long term, this will have the trickle-down effect of attracting the sub-contractors of these large manufacturers, who will prefer to be closely located to the supply chain.”"

March 9): Gold rallied above $1,700 an ounce as a concerted global rush into havens intensified, with the upswing driven by turmoil in the oil market, the spread of the coronavirus, sinking equities, and expectations of easier monetary policy as recession risks loom ever larger.
The precious metal hit the highest level since 2012 as Brent crude collapsed at the start of trading in Asia, while futures on the S&P 500 Index sank more than 4%. Investors have already driven holdings in bullion-backed exchange-traded funds to a record as the coronavirus slammed the outlook for growth.
The traditional haven has sprinted higher this year, following an 18% surge in 2019, as the global health crisis expanded and central banks cut interest rates to try and stem the damage. Gold has immunity to the virus, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which dubbed the metal as the currency of last resort and predicted that prices could top $1,800 an ounce.
“There’s a clear rush to safe-haven assets at the moment and gold’s a major beneficiary,” said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney. Markets are concerned that “we could see a more ugly situation before things get better, which of course is good news for gold,” he said.
Spot gold surged as much as 1.8% to $1,703.39 an ounce, the highest since December 2012, and traded at $1,694.54 at 8:33 a.m. in Singapore. The gains came as 10-year U.S. Treasury yields plunged below 0.5% to a record low amid the stampede for safer assets.
The U.S. and Europe now face the “distinct possibility” of technical recessions in the first half as the outbreak hurts demand and supply, and drives investors to safe havens, according to Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Joachim Fels. Over the weekend, Italy locked down a swathe of the nation.
Even after the Federal Reserve implemented an emergency rate cut last week, there are forecasts for more easing, which would benefit non-interest bearing gold. In addition, investors will track this week’s scheduled policy meeting of the European Central Bank.
The surge in bullion prices is boosting miners’ shares. Newcrest Mining Ltd., Australia’s largest gold producer, rose more than 4% in Sydney, while Northern Star Resources Ltd. climbed 2.1%. The gains came as broader equity benchmarks saw significant declines.
Among other main precious metals, silver was flat, while platinum fell 1.1% and palladium dropped 2.5%."

Digital era: 'New infrastructure' to drive Chinese economy
BEIJING : China is accelerating the construction of 'new infrastructure, ' which is expected to bring new drivers for the economy, especially in sectors like new consumption, new manufacturing and new services.
The country will accelerate the construction of new infrastructure such as 5G networks and data centres, said a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee on March 4.
In the industrial era, infrastructure is represented by railways, highways and airports, but in the digital era, digital facilities such as optical cables and mobile communications have become increasingly important.
Liu Duo, president of the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), said 5G is crucial for digital transformation in many sectors to boost innovation and underpin the growth of the economy and society.
The accelerated construction of new infrastructure, such as 5G, data centres and industrial internet, is important to achieve stable investment, steady growth and high-quality economic growth, she said.
By 2025, China's 5G network construction investment will reach 1.2 trillion yuan (about US$172.66 billion), which will bring about 3.5 trillion yuan of investment in the upstream and downstream of the industrial chain, the CAICT forecast in an industry report on 5G.
In the next five years, the economic output indirectly driven by 5G businesses in China will hit 24.8 trillion yuan, according to the report.
New infrastructure construction will cover not only internet infrastructure, but also computing infrastructure, according to market insiders.
""Cloud is defining everything, and everything is defining cloud,"" said Liu Song, vice president of Alibaba.
The computing landscape has changed greatly compared with five years ago, he said, adding that hardware is important, but it is also important to strengthen the coordination between machines and improve computing capacity.
Cloud computing has maintained rapid growth, creating conditions for many intelligent applications.
Among the distinct trends that have emerged in the digital era, the online office is gaining strong momentum, as more people have stayed at home to engage in remote work and online education amid the Covid-19 outbreak.
Zhang Qingyuan, chief operating officer of Chinese software company Kingsoft Office, said its WPS Office software had more than 239 million monthly active users as of March 2.
He believed 2020 will be the first year of the online office, an important development for many online office software developers.
New business modes are expected to boom amid the accelerated construction of new infrastructure.
Unmanned delivery is one of them. The catering chain brand Xiaoheng Dumplings, for example, has cooperated with an unmanned vehicle enterprise to pilot unmanned vehicle delivery services in Beijing.
Li Heng, founder of Xiaoheng Dumplings, believes unmanned delivery is the future of the industry as it is safer and more efficient.
The total amount of information consumption brought by 5G commerce will exceed 8.3 trillion yuan by 2025, according to the CAICT report.
The spillover effect of new infrastructure construction is significant, as it will boost new consumption and new manufacturing to become a fresh driver of development, said Wang Zhiqin, vice-president of the CAICT."

PETALING JAYA: Dr Mahathir Mohamad says the Muhyiddin Yassin administration will be able to last till the next general election, and that it has the power of incumbency to attract more support.
“Now, when he is in the government, he can give sweeteners to many people. I have found out that many of my supporters, now that they have been appointed as ministers, have switched sides,” he told Malay daily Sinar Harian in an interview.
As such, Mahathir said, the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition would not be able to mount a challenge in the Dewan Rakyat to oust Muhyiddin.
He blamed former prime minister Najib Razak for orchestrating a conspiracy to bring down the PH government.
“The person who was really conspiring was Najib. After his defeat, he had the idea to establish a Malay-Muslim government so that he could get support from the Malays and win,” said Mahathir.
He also denied that he was behind moves to oust DAP from the PH government.
“There was no reason for me to be involved in a conspiracy. I was already the prime minister.”
Mahathir said he hoped Muhyiddin could carry on with the policies of the 22-month-old PH administration, which collapsed late last month after Muhyiddin and several MPs broke ranks to form a new bloc with Barisan Nasional, PAS and GPS.
Mahathir also cited the Shared Prosperity Vision 2030 launched in October last year.
“That is a good policy and the man who came up with the policy is also in the (current) Cabinet. Let’s not ditch it,” he added.

KOSZARHEGY, Hungary: Istvan Simon's factory in western Hungary churns out more than a million plastic parts a day but on a busy morning in one of its large production halls there is only the sound of machines clicking and whirring. Workers have all but disappeared.
Similar transformations are underway on production lines across the European Union's eastern wing as surging wage bills undermine the region's reputation as a cheap production base. Factory owners from Hungary to the Czech Republic and Poland find themselves with little choice but to invest in the automation of their manufacturing processes if they want to remain competitive.
Manufacturing in the region has boomed since the EU expanded eastwards in the mid 2000s, with companies such as automakers Audi and Daimler opening local production lines and spawning supplier ecosystems, but more recently strong economic growth has led to a shortage of workers and rising wages.
An employee walks at the Simon Manufacturer of Plastic Products in Koszarhegy, Hungary.
""We can see human labour being replaced with machinery and artificial intelligence,"" Hungarian union leader Zoltan Laszlo said. ""Not just in the car sector... but also in the steel and machinery industries.
""Such investments can already be seen in these sectors, leading to job losses. You need to glue numerous tiny slivers together and all of a sudden you get the big picture.""
Employment figures are one indication the region's industry may be at a turning point.
While Hungary's economy grew nearly 5% last year and manufacturing investments rose at the fastest pace in three years, the sector shed nearly 23,000 jobs, ending a six-year run of annual employment growth. Czech data showed a year-on-year loss of almost a thousand manufacturing jobs in the third quarter of 2019, suggesting employment in the sector could have declined for the first time since 2013 over the full year.

""There are no operators in this hall right now,"" said Peter Simon, chief executive of Simon Plastics, as he overlooked a line of machines making plugs for car parts, a key product line at the company founded by Istvan, his father, 35 years ago.
""Wages are going up, the prices of robots are coming down, so this is the way to get returns,"" he said. Looking to expand output but pressured by surging wages and falling prices, all of the company's recent 1bil forint investment was spent on automation.
The company hasn't cut any of its 400 jobs so far, finding other positions for those whose work has been replaced by robots, but it intends to automate its remaining manual work after a 50% jump in operator wages over the past three years."

Although the automation process has so far been a gradual one, Josef Stredula, head of the Czech-Moravian Confederation of Trade Unions, said based on various estimates up to 10% of jobs could disappear.
""Big changes are awaiting us,"" Stredula said, adding that while automation may ease the burden of heavy or repetitive manual work it was important to ease the transition, for example by retraining affected workers.
""We have to do everything to make the future not so bleak but relatively easier for everyone.""
Although the automation process has so far been a gradual one, Josef Stredula, head of the Czech-Moravian Confederation of Trade Unions, said based on various estimates up to 10% of jobs could disappear.
Staffing company Hays recently noted that the average annual wage increase in the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary of around 10% was far higher than in many western countries and estimated that almost 5% of Hungarian jobs, or 200,000 roles, could be fully automated over the next decade.
Hungarian recruitment portal profession.hu registered an 11% fall in manufacturing sector job postings last year. In the Czech Republic, Grafton Recruitment has seen a similar drop, while consultancy Deloitte has estimated around half of current jobs could be replaced by machines.
""It is only a question of when it will be more economical for most companies to start with automation on a much bigger scale,"" said David Marek, Deloitte's chief economist in Prague.
Not black and white
At a distribution centre near Prague, Czech yoghurt maker Hollandia Karlovy Vary installed three robotic arms last year to sort and load yoghurts onto pallets, replacing the work of 10 people who were moved to other positions.
Meanwhile, Poland's largest clothing retailer LPP plans to invest in logistics and automation in a bid to improve margins and combat higher labour costs.
Judit Kovacs, a manager at human resources company Randstad, said factories with high capacity utilisation in western Hungary had started reducing headcount by attrition over the past year, while new plants in eastern Hungary were being planned with a high degree of automation as investors looked to curb their labour market exposure.

It's not only manufacturing that is falling to the machines, insurance company Allianz's Hungarian unit, for example, is automating data processing to offset rising wage costs.
The International Federation of Robotics (IFR) expects robot sales in major Eastern European economies to rise through 2022 but although it acknowledges that some jobs will disappear, it does not foresee a major net effect on employment.
""The question is not do I invest in manual labour or automation,"" IFR General Secretary Susanne Bieller said, explaining that automation could help companies maintain a competitive edge over cheaper production hubs elsewhere in the world.
""You cannot see this in black-and-white terms."""

Forecasting Asia's economic growth path
All things considered, we believe Asia remains an attractive region—particularly within emerging markets—but investors will do well to be more selective when investing in the continent in the year ahead.
We expect the economic slowdown in Asia—as a result of the U.S.-China trade war—to hit a trough later this year and believe the ensuing recovery will be more gradual in nature.
In our view, whether we’ll see an “L-shaped” recovery in Asia will depend on whether U.S. dollar strength persists, and if Beijing holds back from unleashing a massive stimulus to revive China’s economy.
From an investment perspective, it’s easy to adopt a sanguine view of Asia. The region’s growth rate—expected to hit 5.1% this year¹—continues to incite envy from its peers in the developed world. Equally significant is the fact that the continent occupies the quality end of the emerging-market (EM) universe, making it more appealing to investors. However, that’s not to say that the region is immune from the global economic slowdown.
In our view, the economic downturn in Asia has yet to hit a bottom. Although global risk sentiment has improved in recent weeks, stubbornly low economic growth and low inflation leave markets vulnerable to a reversal in sentiment. We expect a prolonged bottoming-out process and believe subsequent growth will be “L-shaped.”
As the world’s growth engine, the shape of Asia’s recovery has enormous relevance to investors. There are two key reasons why we believe that an L-shaped growth path looks most likely: first, there are numerous headwinds to growth; and second, the region’s governments’ ability to revive growth—from a policy perspective—is somewhat constrained.
Headwinds to growth
Asia’s economic growth is typically tied to the global industrial cycle, which has been dampened as a result of deteriorating business investment, itself a consequence of the uncertainty brought about by the U.S.-China trade war. Fixed asset investment growth in the region has already slowed significantly on a year-on-year basis from 5.1% at the start of 2018 to just half a percent in mid-2019.² Notably, given that the cumulative impact of the trade dispute has yet to be fully reflected in the economic data so far,³ it’s fair to surmise that Asian exports are likely to remain sluggish through 2020."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=130","Mar 12, 2020 9:39 AM","THEREALDEAL","China isn’t coming to the rescue: Over the past decade, the global economy has grown accustomed to relying on Chinese stimulus to rekindle growth. Previous slowdowns, most notably in 2008/09 and 2016, saw China unleash huge lending programs to spur construction, reviving the domestic economy and giving the global economy a nice lift along the way. Interestingly, although growth in China has slowed to its lowest level in nearly three decades, policy response to the current downtown has been limited to measures such as tax reforms, cuts to bank reserve requirements, and tweaks to local government bond issuance.
We believe Beijing will have to accept that it might miss its 6% GDP growth target for 2020—a development that would mark a critical turning point in the global growth cycle. Of note, we believe the Chinese government’s restraint can be traced back to how previous rounds of credit-fueled stimulus aggravated problems in the financials sector. Given the authorities’ stated preference to avoid fueling financial instability, the scale of any forthcoming stimulus will likely be limited in scope and insufficient to reflate the global economy."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=130","Mar 12, 2020 9:40 AM","THEREALDEAL","Weakness in manufacturing sectors as a result of trade uncertainty is weighing on domestic demand: On a year-on-year basis, growth in private consumption demand growth has slowed significantly in the last 18 months—from 5.8% in January 2018 to 4.1% in June 2019.2 On balance, we’re inclined to believe that the risk is for more pronounced weakness in the months ahead.
Inventories are at risk of deeper correction cycle: Manufacturing inventory ratios in Thailand, Taiwan, and South Korea remain at multi-year highs⁴—where we’re concerned this is a sign that the inventory correction cycle could have further to run.
Idiosyncratic risk factors are surfacing: Geography-specific factors are weighing on domestic demand. The ongoing social unrest in Hong Kong, which contributed to tipping the territory into a technical recession in the third quarter, is one such example. Similarly, financial stability concerns in India stemming from the prolonged financial stress among rural households are also on the rise—a credit crunch among nonbank financial institutions have also increased the probability of a more entrenched slowdown in India. These are all issues that investors should monitor in the year ahead.
Policy space is relatively constrained
In our view, the policy space within which global central banks can maneuver to support growth is constrained by the already low level of interest rates. As monetary policy reaches its natural limits, the focus is shifting increasingly toward fiscal policy. Asian central banks are in a similar position given that policy rates in many countries are already at, or near, record lows. This perhaps explains why we’ve seen a flurry of announcements on the fiscal front in recent months—corporate tax cuts in India and Thailand, labor law reforms in Indonesia that are aimed at boosting investment, and China’s decision to bring forward special purpose bonds for infrastructure spending. Crucially, while the room to ease fiscal policy varies widely across Asia, it’s important to note that much of the region still has fiscal space to implement such measures. However, as budget deficits widen, deficit financing, liquidity, and the government budget constraint become important considerations."

From a long-term perspective, we believe that the United States and China are engaged in a prolonged strategic decoupling. Consequently, although the current détente appears to be supporting risk appetite, we don’t expect this to be sustainable. In other words, a breakdown in the phased U.S.-China trade talks continues to be a key risk in the year ahead, particularly as the focus of negotiations broadens to include more complex topics.
Issues where both sides aren’t likely to come to an agreement easily come to mind:
Intellectual property rights protection (specifically in the technology space)
China’s response to the U.S.-led Blue Dot Network, which is widely seen as a project devised to rival China’s Belt and Road Initiative
The recent inclusion of nearly 30 Chinese companies on the U.S. Commerce Department’s “entity list”
These issues are likely to make already difficult negotiations even more delicate. Where markets are concerned, this could mean further weakness in the Chinese yuan and a risk-off environment—particularly in light of slowing Chinese growth. In our view, investors will need to be more discriminating and selective in 2020.
That said, we continue to view Asia as a relatively attractive region from an asset allocation perspective—especially within the EM complex given the region’s narrower output gap, low and steady inflation, and low market volatility. Nonetheless, given the unpredictable nature of U.S.-China trade discussions, quick reversals in risk appetite are unlikely to disappear.
Within Asia, we prefer markets that are less exposed to trade tensions. As U.S. firms scramble to identify alternative products to replace Chinese imports, Malaysia’s likely to feature—in our view—near the top of their list in the short run, with Thailand and the Philippines not far behind. However, if the global manufacturing and supply chain were to shift away from China in a more permanent fashion, then Vietnam is likely to be the main beneficiary over the longer term, followed by Malaysia, Singapore, and India.
Key risks to our view
Economic forecasting, although quantitative in nature, isn’t an exact science. As the late professor Rudi Dornbusch once said, “In economics, things take longer to happen than you think they will, then they happen faster than you thought they could.”5 In this instance, our analysis could be undermined by a much sharper than expected depreciation in the U.S. dollar (USD), which could loosen global financial conditions and reboot the global business cycle, and a stimulus package from Beijing that’s large enough to rekindle growth. In our view, these two factors will play an outsized role in determining the shape of the coming Asian recovery."

Economic stimulus package to be reviewed
PUTRAJAYA: The government has agreed to review the economic stimulus package launched by the previous Pakatan Harapan government.
Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said the reviewed stimulus package would ensure target segments are given priority, and restore investor confidence.
“The Cabinet has agreed for the stimulus package to be re-presented and reviewed to see if the previous amount announced can be increased.
“I will leave this to the Finance Minister,” he said in a press conference after chairing his first Cabinet meeting at Perdana Putra here today.
The reviewed stimulus package, he added, would be launched in one to two weeks’ time.
The 2020 Economic Stimulus Package was announced on Feb 27 by former prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad to safeguard the economy from impacts associated with the Covid-19 outbreak."

IR4.0: How It’s Going to Change Malaysian Manufacturing ?
What Exactly is Industry 4.0 or IR4.0?
“With this heightened utilization of automation and digitalization, workers will have to equip themselves to stay relevant.”
In the past, the first industrial revolution started with the use of steam and water powered machines that took over manual labour. The second industrial revolution happened with the discovery of electricity, which allowed the mass production of items and greatly contributed to expanding economies around the world. Soon, computers were used to control electrically powered machines, and this led to the third industrial revolution.
Suggested Read : 7 Things You Should Know About ‘Industry 4.0’
We are all currently living in the age of the fourth industrial revolution where big data and cyber-physical systems take centre stage. “The fourth industrial revolution is about bringing a heightened sense of automation and digitalization that would eliminate the need for manpower in routine and repetitive tasks” says Dato’ Vignaesvaran. He goes on to explain that “With this heightened utilization of automation and digitalization, workers will have to equip themselves to stay relevant.”
The fourth industrial revolution is yet to hit Malaysian shores but more and more industry players expressed interest in using cyber-physical systems. Hence, the Malaysian workforce needs to be trained to handle these new systems.
According to Dato’ Vignaesvaran, only 31% of the 15 million strong Malaysian workforce is considered skilled enough and this number has to be pushed up to 35% – 40% in order to keep up with industrial demands come 2020.
only 31% of the 15 million strong Malaysian workforce is considered skilled enough
With the IR 4.0 coming into industries, the increased automation would lead to lower demand on human workers to do repetitive tasks, as these will be taken over by machines. However, Dato’ Vignaesvaran stressed that instead of firing these factory workers, the HRDF is encouraging industries to upgrade their workers from doing routine tasks like soldering, into workers who are able to operate and supervise machines that will perform the soldering on their behalf.
Industry 4.0 involves several aspects, and one key factor is known as the ‘Internet of Things’ whereby machines are not just computerized to perform tasks but can communicate with one another through the internet and through cloud computing.
Dato’ Vignaesvaran very aptly gave the example of the manufacturing of cars, where IR4.0 machines will be able to customize your car orders to more specific requirements and can request custom-made parts in the production line from other machines within its vicinity with a minimal need for human presence.
Raising Awareness about IR4.0 among SMEs
Among the important tasks for HRDF, according to Dato’ Vignaesvaran, is reaching out to SME business owners and letting them know the importance of embracing IR4.0 and understanding how this fourth industrial revolution is going to affect them and their businesses. “SMEs need to stay relevant and need to keep up with the times,” said Dato’ Vignaesvaran. He adds that aiming for zero defects in production is one of the goals that SMEs can achieve with IR4.0 technology, which will make them much more attractive to clients and customers alike.
SMEs will also stand to be more competitive as manufacturing operations can be done with a much smaller workforce than previously required. SME business owners need to realize that the fourth industrial revolution will eventually reach the country and they need to have the relevant training and information, as well as skilled employees to be able to adopt new technologies and keep up with the rest of the world.
65% of Malaysian could lose their current jobs by 2027"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=130","Mar 16, 2020 8:34 AM","THEREALDEAL","What is the Need to Re-Skill, Up-Skill and Multi-Skill Employees?
Recently, Datuk Seri Abdul Rahman Dahlan, the minister in the Prime Minister’s Department mentioned that up to 65% of Malaysian could lose their current jobs by 2027 as technological advancements render people’s tasks redundant. Retrenchment could become the norm in the not too distant future as companies restructure skill allotments due to the adoption of IR 4.0 technology.
While Dato’ Vignaesvaran does not deny this possibility, he also states that the HRDF is committed to helping businesses and especially SMEs re-train their staff and upgrade them. One example of this is how the HRDF is working with a factory in Ipoh to train their operators to reach assistant engineer levels.
HRDF is also channelling funds to other training programs to encourage ICT adoption and the utilizing of Big Data by employees so that they not only know repetitive jobs, but are able to handle more complex systems when the IR4.0 technology finally hits the Malaysian industrial scene.
Fears and Misconceptions about IR 4.0 Debunked
According to Dato’ Vignaesvaran, many people misunderstand IR 4.0 and think that it involves purely the automation of production processes. He stresses that this is not the case, as IR 4.0 technology involves the key aspect of ‘The Internet of Things’, whereby automated machines are now able to communicate with one another and transmit data from one machine to another.
IR 4.0 also goes one step further and has technology that will be able to make decisions on its own in an autonomous manner and therefore optimize production without the help of humans. Additionally, these machines will be able to perform tasks impossible or unsafe for human workers, meaning that they can reach formerly unreachable places and work harder and longer than humans ever can.
In addition to just having misconceptions, Dato’ Vignaesvaran also highlighted the two main fears regarding the advent of IR 4.0, the first of which is when workers fear losing their jobs to machines and the second by business owners who are afraid that keeping up with the times will mean spending more resources than they can afford in order to replace machinery, thereby endangering their finances and losing competitiveness.
For business owners, Dato’ Vignaesvaran stated that they don’t have to replace machineries completely, as HRDF is working with PSDC to come up with ideas on how to retrofit their old machines in an affordable manner. This is to adopt the new virtual IR 4.0 communication technology which is the hallmark of the ‘Internet of Things’ concept.
He also advises SMEs to adopt this technology as soon as possible; the earlier they’re prepared, the less they stand to lose when IR 4.0 actually reaches Malaysia.
As for employees that are afraid to lose their jobs, Dato’ Vignaesvaran urges industries to start re-training their employees, stressing that employees themselves must be on a skill level that is compatible with the IR 4.0 technology if they wish to stay employable and competitive."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=130","Mar 16, 2020 8:34 AM","THEREALDEAL","How Prepared is Malaysia in the IR 4.0 and Big Data Race?
Dato’ Vignaesvaran mentioned that it is inevitable that IR 4.0 will reach Malaysia, saying that “it is not a matter of ‘if’ but ‘when’ – and that ‘when’ is already upon us”. He stresses that whether Malaysian business owners are prepared or not, they must take it upon themselves to adopt the technology or lose out in the long run.
He repeatedly stated that Industry players must not assume that IR 4.0 will not affect them, as even lorry drivers in the transport business will be affected. In developed countries, new technologies are being developed and tested whereby old machines and operation systems in transport companies are retrofitted with more intelligent technology which can record orders and direct autonomous vehicles to deliver stocks at the most opportune times, all without the need of human drivers, supervisors or stockists.
As IR4.0 becomes less of science fiction and more of a reality, Indian business owners need to learn more about how to safeguard their trade from losing the competitive edge. The way to do this is to be educated via engaging with the HRDF training programs and other available programs to help SMEs face the coming challenge of IR 4.0

KUALA LUMPUR (March 14): I came into contact with patient no. 26 on Feb 24. I had a runny nose the following day and consulted the neighborhood clinic, in which the doctor dismissed any possibility of Covid-19.
I consulted the clinic again on Feb 29 after I developed a fever. Again I was assured not to worry about being infected with Covid-19, and a blood test was taken to confirm that I was not having dengue.
On March 1, I received news from patient no. 26 that he had been admitted to hospital since Feb 27 and he was tested positive.
I immediately rushed to Sungai Buloh Hospital for a test and I was asked to go home after that. I received a call informing me to be admitted to hospital the following evening. I have since been in Sungai Buloh Hospital undergoing tests, all of which showed I am relatively well and healthy in spite of the infection. I expect to be discharged in the next one or two days.
I wish to apologise to all whom I have unknowingly infected.
Fortunately, all of those I had contact with prior to Feb 24 are well and healthy, including my children, grandchildren, friends and business associates. I sincerely apologise for any inconveniences I have unknowingly caused. I have always been a responsible citizen and community person and I regret this very much.
The purpose of me writing this is to tell Malaysians and the world of the sincere dedication of our medical and healthcare workers whom I have encountered in Sungai Buloh Hospital. I hear the same touching stories from friends who are quarantined in other government hospitals.
There were criticisms of the quality of our government hospitals. Having experienced first hand, I can categorically state that none of them are warranted. I saw only professionalism and patience with compassion by our dedicated healthcare providers, from the top consultants to the daily doctors, to the nurses and medical assistants.
They do this with every touch of the stethoscope on patients’ bodies, with each time they inhale the same air, and the times they allow themselves to come in contact with the patients. All of which are done selflessly disregarding the exposure they put themselves into. They are our unsung heroes!
These heroic ground crews, supported by the Ministry of Health (MoH), are committed to the promotion of health awareness.
MoH's constant live updates on current situations and corresponding statistics do not go unnoticed. More Malaysians are now keeping watch of MoH’s various channels over the Internet and social media to stay informed.
I am eternally grateful to the personnel from the Pejabat Kesihatan Daerah (PKD) Petaling and the medical team from the Sungai Buloh Hospital, all of whom are too many to name and whose faces I cannot identify as they were mostly in Hazmat suits as if too humble to disclose their heroic faces and too shy to reveal their names to be remembered.
The very few names I can tell are Dr Haykal Ghazali and Dr Salina Md Talib from PKD Petaling, Dr Yasmin Mohd Ghani, Dr Azmah, Dr Lim, Dr Esmond, etc from Sungai Buloh Hospital whose care and patience are the epitome of Florence Nightingale and Mother Teresa.
They and their colleagues are the true heroes as Malaysia combats Covid-19. I say a Big Thank You to them. I call on the Prime Minister and the MoH to herald and acknowledge these silent heroes.
Malaysia must not bow to this unfortunate calamity. Let us stand united to give full support to our government's effort in combating this global epidemic. May God the Almighty protect us as a nation and spring us to rise back stronger from this adversity."

THE technology sector is expected to see a mixed outlook for the year — as related companies and firms strive to balance their demand and supply — amid global tech giants’ warning of demand softness along with a challenging and uncertain operating environment following the Covid-19 outbreak.
“The final quarter results were a mixed bag with under-performance or matching our expectations, at best. We started 2020 in a rather bearish stance, but since the share prices of sector companies have retraced a lot, it’s not as bearish,” Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd (HLIB) senior analyst Tan J Young told The Malaysian Reserve in a brief reply yesterday.
The investment bank is taking a conservative stand on the sector in the absence of near-term catalysts and taking into consideration the seasonal weakness in the first quarter of the year (1Q20).
Tan maintained his ‘Neutral’ call on the technology sector but has rolled forward all stock valuations to the next calendar year (CY21), as global sales and spending forecasts are pointing north for 2020 with moderate expansions.
“The boost local companies may get from a stronger US dollar may be neutralised by higher commodity prices. Growth is expected to be driven by smartphones, communication, high-performance computing (HPC) and Internet of Things (IoT), while automotive takes a back seat,” he stated.
BIMB Securities Research in a note on Tuesday said while the firm has maintained its ’Neutral’ outlook on the overall sector, it has an ‘Overweight’ call on the IT services subsector and an ’Underweight’ call on the outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) subsector.
“We are positive on the IT services subsector as we believe the companies under coverage will continue to benefit from ongoing government efforts to adopt digitalisation in all business levels.
“Our negative outlook for the OSAT subsector is due to uncertainty on global semiconductor sales, which would exert downside risk to earnings for companies under our coverage,” it said."

Equity market indicators, regulatory ratios and banking supervision
BANKING is one of the most heavily supervised and regulated industries. Yet, banking failures always seem to catch regulators and depositors by surprise. Why is this the case?
A recent International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) study argues that the disconnect may be due to regulators looking at the wrong ratios. The regulatory ratios, the study argues, are by definition stale, backward looking and ones that are complex and have been computed based on a large number of estimated parameters.
For example, the Tier 1 capital ratio — a commonly used regulatory indicator that uses risk-weighted assets — requires not only a huge number of computations, but also parameter inputs that are estimates.
Critics like Andrew Haldane of the Bank of England argue that the complexity not only increases opacity, but the subjectivity involved renders it no better than a coin toss in predicting bank failures.
Banking regulation revolves largely around the three pillars of the Basel framework. Bank supervisors are supposed to evaluate banks based on the CAMELS framework — an acronym for capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk.
Since many parts of this assessment are subjective, there is a tendency to focus on the numerically derived ratios, in particular the Tier 1 capital ratio.
Such a focus may be inherently flawed since the ratio is computed infrequently, quarterly at best, is backward looking and often plagued by issues of accounting treatment.
Rendering suspects its use as an early warning signal. No surprise, therefore, that the Royal Bank of Scotland supposedly had the second-highest Tier 1 ratio of the UK’s top banks until just before needing a bailout.
The IMF study cites several other cases where the regulatory ratios were simply too late to be of any use. In overcoming the inadequacy, this and several previous studies suggest the use of equity market indicators of solvency together with the regulatory ratios in assessing bank stability.
Several market-derived indicators like the yield of a bank’s outstanding bonds or the spread of its credit default swaps (CDS) could be of use.
Some argue equity market indicators are superior to debt market ones, largely because equity markets are more liquid and more efficient at processing new information than other markets.
The presence of equity analysts and other researchers, who closely monitor listed firms, ensure equity prices quickly adjust to new information.
Equity prices are forward looking with expectations built-in, thereby enhancing their currency and relevance as indicators of solvency.
Using a sample of 220 listed banks across the world, one research paper examined the relative efficacy of the regulatory Tier 1 ratio against several market- derived ratios like the market capitalisation ratio, leverage ratio, implied volatility and CDS spreads in predicting bank distress.
When tested for the period just prior to the global financial crisis of 2008-09, the Tier 1 ratio performed poorly, confirming Haldane’s argument that they may be no better than a coin toss.
By contrast, the best predictability came from the market-based ratios. The best and cleanest was the market capitalisation ratio. The results were consistent even in the post-crisis period.
These findings have huge implications for banking regulators and policymakers of the Muslim world. Given the generally underdeveloped capital markets and infantile equity markets, the central banks of these countries may be missing a key lever of banking supervision and regulation.
If market-based ratios are wonderful predictors of banking fragility, the underlying assumption is well functioning markets. Unless equity markets are efficient and functioning smoothly, market-based ratios cannot be meaningful.
For this to happen, several requisites have to be met. First, banks must all be publicly listed and equity markets have to be highly liquid, offering the depth and breadth needed by the diverse range of participants.
Good governance of the listed entities needs to be ensured through regulation that compels adequate timely disclosure. Rule of law and its fair enforcement needs to be paramount.
Holding management accountable to the various stakeholders is a necessity. Since equity markets are an intermediary just like banks, faith and confidence in them are important.
While the regulatory framework and ratios are intended to instil this confidence, the experience with past bank failures has shown there can never be enough regulation to make a very brittle system supple enough to withstand shocks.
The Basel banking framework has evolved with each systemic banking crisis and the current version, Basel III, was born out of the inadequacies exposed by the last subprime induced global financial crisis."

CORONAVIRUS | The two-week movement control order announced by the government last night to reduce the spread of Covid-19 has raised questions as to how this would impact the workforce.
The order, which is to take effect tomorrow, will see all non-essential government and private venues shut down, meaning most offices will be closed."

The packed gathering, where guests had to take shuttle buses to sleep at other venues, was attended by nationals from dozens of countries, including Canada, Nigeria, India and Australia, according to an attendee list posted on social media.
There were also citizens of China and South Korea – two countries with high rates of coronavirus infections.
Social media posts show hundreds of worshippers praying shoulder-to-shoulder inside the mosque, while some guests posted selfies as they shared food.
Only half of the Malaysian participants who attended have come forward for testing, raising fears that the outbreak from the mosque could be more far-reaching
Khuzaifah said some of the worshippers who attended the event have since refused to be tested for coronavirus, preferring to rely on God to protect them.
Karim, a 44-year-old Malaysian who attended the gathering and was later tested positive for coronavirus, says the government should have cancelled the event.
“We are a bit disappointed that this outbreak has been blamed entirely on us. That view is unfair. There was no ban on our gathering,” said Karim, who gave only his first name.
“Now I am concerned because I am positive. Please pray for me.”
The worst is not over yet, so please pray for all

MALAYSIAN equities continued their downward spiral yesterday, with the benchmark index of the country’s 30 largest stocks recording its fifth straight day of losses as the Covid-19 case count keeps rising.
The FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) fell 1.4% or 17.57 points to close at 1,239.01 yesterday, bringing total market capitalisation loss over the last five days to RM109.52 billion. The MSCI AC Asia Pacific Index slipped 0.11%.
Among the main index-linked laggards were Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, Axiata Group Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd, Genting Bhd, Public Bank Bhd and RHB Bank Bhd.
Gainers included Maxis Bhd, IHH Healthcare Bhd, Hong Leong Financial Group Bhd and Petronas Dagangan Bhd.
Maybank Investment Bank Bhd said the gauge could reach an extreme level, making bottom-fishing likely, particularly in banking, plantation, consumer and dividend yield stocks.
On the other hand, BIMB Securities Sdn Bhd believed markets might rebound out of hope, though the worst is yet to come.
“Malaysia recorded its worst one-day outbreak over the weekend, raising the number to 428 — the highest cases among Asean. We think this could impact market sentiment as consumers turned increasingly cautious on spending.
“Secondly, there is little evidence to suggest that the coronavirus outbreak could have reached its peak soon and if this pandemic would end by summer,” it said in a note.
Malaysia reported 117 new Covid-19 cases yesterday, bringing the country’s total to 790, including 60 recoveries and two deaths.
History suggests the impact of an economic shock could be a drawn out affair for financial markets as seen in 2008 to 2009, when the global financial crisis hit, BIMB Securities added.
“The S&P 500 found a bottom at -58% in six months, while the FBM KLCI fell by 47% in 10 months,” it stated.
Malaysia isn’t alone in the bear market territory, though. Global stocks have been roiling in recent days as governments worldwide struggle to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.
Since 2019, or over the last 15 months, the FBM KLCI has lost 26%, sliding from 1,691 to 1,257 points. About 6% of the decline occurred in 2019, while the remaining 20% was lost in the first quarter this year.
Meanwhile, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index has fallen 14% from 966 to 827 points over the same period.
According to AmInvestment Bank Bhd, a silver lining in the seemingly unabated fall in the FBM KLCI is visible.
“Assuming the FBM KLCI is to fall by about another 100 points from the current level to 1,150 points, this will bring the FBM KLCI in line with the MSCI EM Index’s 10-year (2010-2019) average price-earnings ratio of 13.3 times.
“This will put Malaysia back onto the radar of international emerging-markets fund managers, who currently generally feel less excited about Malaysia due to its high valuations,” the research house said.
Oil also slumped to the lowest in nearly 17 years, with Brent crude touching US$27.85 (RM121.70) per barrel as at press time.
“Both Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate continue wilting as the ongoing price war and the exponential increase in countries closing borders crushed any rebound hopes.
“Producers and refiners are now madly scrambling to find onshore and offshore storage facilities for the upcoming weave of oil that nobody wants in April,” Oanda Corp Asia-Pacific senior market analyst Jeffrey
Halley wrote in a note yesterday.
That alone, according to Halley, will keep a lid on prices, even without the demand shock from the Covid-19 pandemic."

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters): Malaysian authorities are scrambling to track down about 2,000 Rohingya men who attended a religious gathering that has led to a big spike in Covid-19 cases across South-East Asia, a security source and two other people told Reuters.
More than 100,000 Rohingya live in Malaysia after fleeing from Myanmar, but they are considered illegal immigrants. Their status would likely make many of them reluctant to identify themselves to get tested for the virus even if they showed symptoms, other sources, in the Rohingya community, said.
Malaysia's search for the Rohingya highlights the challenge for governments trying to track the virus among communities living without official papers and wary of authorities.
The religious gathering late last month at a mosque on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur was attended by some 16,000 people, including the Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, one source said.
As well as the Rohingya, about 1,500 Muslims from across Asia attended.
Nearly 600 Covid-19 cases in South-East Asia have been linked to the gathering, including 513 in Malaysia, 61 in Brunei, 22 in Cambodia, at least five in Singapore and two in Thailand.
Malaysia has 790 virus cases in all.
Malaysian authorities have been tracking down the participants but say they have been unable to find about 4,000 of them.
""They have gone back to their families across Malaysia, it has become difficult for us to contact them. Many are afraid of admitting that they attended, they fear they will get into problems with the authorities,"" one of the sources, who works with the refugee community, said.
""The government is concerned that if they don't come forward, the infection might spread further.""
The government had asked the police criminal investigation division to look for the missing participants, the security source said.
Police declined to comment and directed queries to the Malaysian National Security Council under the Prime Minister's Office. It could not immediately be reached for comment.
Malaysia implemented travel curbs and shut down non-essential businesses from Wednesday (March 18) for two weeks to contain the virus after the spike in cases linked to the mosque gathering. One person who attended the gathering died from Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, this week.
Participants spent most of their time crowded into the mosque for the four-day event, but some went to restaurants, shopping malls and Kuala Lumpur's landmark Petronas twin towers, according to Reuters interviews with people who attended and social media posts.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Malaysia told Reuters it had heard that refugees and asylum-seekers were at the gathering and it was working with the Ministry of Health to ensure that all refugee and asylum-seeking communities were included in government response measures.
""Refugees and asylum-seekers are advised to seek medical attention if they present symptoms of Covid-19 infection, regardless of whether they were present at events like the mentioned religious gathering,"" UNHCR Malaysia said in an email.
The Ministry of Health did not respond to requests for comment.
A 39-year Rohingya father of four, who lives in Penang, said he spent days at the mosque event with nearly two dozen Rohingya friends. He said none of them was showing any symptoms and he went to a hospital but no test was done.
""Everything's fine, no fever nothing,"" the construction worker said. Reuters is withholding his name to protect his identity.
Salman, a Bangladeshi construction worker who lives near the mosque, said he and many other Bangladeshis went to the gathering. His virus test was negative but the hospital calls him daily to check if he has symptoms, Salman said.
""When I went for testing, they didn’t ask for passport or work permit or any documents. They just asked for my name, age and address,"" said Salman, who declined to give his full name.

Malaysia on Thursday said it could deploy its armed forces to fully implement movement controls placed to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Malaysian Defense Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said using the armed forces to prevent the spread of the virus ""was among the suggestions raised at the special meeting on COVID-19 on non-health related matters,"" local daily The Star reported.
""I hope that this will not be necessary but if the compliance rate remains low, there is a big possibility that the military will be used [to get people to stay at home],"" Yakoob told reporters.
Malaysia recently imposed the measures, known as the Movement Control Order (MCO), on Wednesday to run until the end of the month. It includes a ban on non-essential workplaces and urges people to stay at home.
Yaakob cited police figures showing a roughly 60% public compliance rate with the MCO precautions.
Malaysia has reported 790 cases of COVID-19. Two people have died of the disease, with nearly 60 others recovering.
Malaysian officials announced they had traced over 10,000 attendees of a mass religious gathering held last month amid the global COVID-19 pandemic, according to the daily Malay Mail.
10,000-person prayer gathering
Urging participants of the gathering to apply for medical tests, Health Director-General Datuk Dr. Noor Hisham Abdullah said one of the participants died on Wednesday.
Noor Hisham added that 10,650 such people were traced.
""Up until midnight March 19, 2020 [March 18, 2020, 1600GMT], 10,553 of the tabligh [Islam preaching] congregants that attended the gathering at Masjid Jamek Seri Petaling have been checked, 4,986 samples taken and 513 positives,"" he said on Twitter.
Since first being detected in Wuhan, China in December, the novel coronavirus has claimed 8,810 lives globally, most in China, according to global data maintained by Johns Hopkins University (JHU).
At least 218,823 cases of the virus have been confirmed in at least 158 countries and territories, with Europe as the new epicenter of the pandemic, according to the World Health Organization.
Despite the rising number of cases, most people who get infected suffer mild symptoms and recover."

KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 — Two Malaysians are among this year’s top 50 world contenders for the Global Teacher Prize award, a competition meant to recognise exceptional educators who have made outstanding contributions to the profession.
The first was English teacher Samuel Isaiah from Sekolah Kebangsaan Runchang in Muadzam Shah, Pahang, who was shortlisted for his outstanding work with the Orang Asli community by championing advanced learning at primary school using tablets and computers.
Isaiah’s method is fairly unique in a rural Orang Asli setting, said Varkey Foundation, the organisation behind the award.
It noted the children at the primary school have learned to love, embrace and use technology and experience English language learning on par with urban schools.
The other, Science teacher Norhailmi Abdul Mutalib from SMK Jerlun, Ayer Hitam, Kedah, made the list for his innovative method in teaching particle physics.
His teaching approach has included empowering his students to decide the direction of their learning and enabling them to produce creative content online through blog writing and video-making, Varkey Foundation said.
Norhailmi had also used collaboration techniques and flipped classrooms to increase students’ performance throughout the year.
The percentage of his students who scored A in science exams increased drastically from only 3.9 per cent in 2015 to 29.85 per cent in 2017 and the percentage of students passing the science subject at his school rose to 96 per cent last year, the organisation added.
“Congratulations to Samuel Isaiah and Norhailmi Abdul Mutalib for reaching the final 50. I hope their stories inspire those looking to enter the teaching profession and highlights the incredible work teachers do all over the world every day,” said Sunny Varkey, the founder.
“Our recent Global Teacher Status Index finally gives academic proof to something that we’ve always instinctively known: the link between the status of teachers in society and the performance of children in school.
“Now we can say beyond doubt that respecting teachers isn’t only an important moral duty — it’s essential for a country’s educational outcomes.”
The Global Teacher Prize Academy, the committee that determines the winner, includes prominent names such as Wendy Kopp, co-founder and CEO of Teach for All and Dean and Professor, Harvard Graduate School of Education, United States; Fareed Zakaria.
A prize committee will pick the top 10 finalists from the 50 shortlisted teachers and a winner will then be chosen by the Global Teacher Prize Academy.
The prize committee and the academy will look for evidence that applicants for the Varkey Foundation Global Teacher Prize had met several criteria.
This includes having employed creative and effective education methods that may be universally replicable, achieving demonstrable student learning outcomes in the classroom and having tangible impact on the community.
The winner will take home US$1 million (RM4.2 million)."

每一个投资者买入一家公司的股权有很多的原因，可能包括了看上他们的成长，喜欢他们稳定的业务，喜欢他们的高派息量，又或者说… 单纯因为人家说好你就跟着买入了
对于人家说好你跟着买入的，除非你确认对方真的是够了解那家公司，不然的话你的行为可以被判定为 “Speculative – 投机性“ 的～那么投资跟投机差别在哪里？很简单，同样一家公司，同样一个价位买入，投资的可能准备部署Average Down，买更多便宜货，而投机的则寝食难安，不清楚到底要不要砍掉，这就是两者之间的差距！
不过，若是因为COVID-19 带来的灾难影响了公司的基本面 / 根基，或者动摇到了你买入的原因的话，那么你就要考虑止损了..
“可是版主啊，你不是要讨论高股息的咩，长篇大论这些课题干嘛？“
这是因为我想打破盲目买入 “高股息“ 股的迷思，我不想你因为现在公司的 Dividend Yield 看起来非常高而买入，后来公司的股息调整后，买入的原因改变了，你又要Cut Loss 了..
首先，我们要先了解Dividend Yield 或者 Dividend-Price Ratio里面包含了什么，他的方程式很简单：
Total Annual Dividend Payment（一年内给出的股息）/ Market Capitalization （市值）= Dividend Yield（股息率）
先看看Market Capitalization（市值），市值代表着的是一家公司在市场上的价值，也等于是股价 x NOSH（市面上的股数），当股价提高了，市值当然跟着提高（NOSH 维持不变的话），因此，我们可以判定：
-市值增加的话，你在目前价位买入的话股息率会减少
-市值减少的话，你在目前价位买入的话股息率会增加
随着近期美国市场崩盘，加上我们自己国家的政治不稳定以及病毒开始爆发的课题，绝大部分公司的股价都大跌了，这也是为什么那么多 “高股息” 股会浮出水面～
那么，Total Annual Dividend Payment（一年内给出的股息）就很好理解，我们可以判定：
公司一年内给出的股息越多，股息率就越高
公司一年内给出的股息越少，股息率就越低
就是那么简单而已，不过，大家有发现当中其实有问题吗？
当我们讨论到一年内给出的股息的时候，我并没有提及 “买入” 的时候，因为这是已经过去的股息率（除非你在最近的 Ex-Date 买入），并不能代表公司未来可以维持这样的股息支付力。"

March 20, 2020 Update: Coronavirus treatment breakthrough: French study confirms that a combination of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Azithromycin are effective in treating COVID-19 patients.
Earlier today, we published a story about a new study published by NIH which shows that Hydroxychloroquine has been found to be more effective and potent than chloroquine in vitro treatment of coronavirus. While the media is focused on the vaccine race and leaving the discussion of THERAPEUTICS almost completely neglected, a recent well controlled clinical study conducted by Didier Raoult​ M.D/Ph.D, et. al in France showed that 100% of patients that received a combination of HCQ and Azithromycin tested negative and were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment. According to a new unearthed paper, new evidence shows CDC knew since at least 2005 that chloroquine is effective against coronaviruses.
In the meantime, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the ‘compassionate use’ of chloroquine to treat coronavirus patients in the United States. In addition, recent guidelines from South Korea and China report that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are effective antiviral therapeutic treatments for novel coronavirus.
A therapeutic agent that prevents infection with novel coronavirus is highly desirable–especially for persons with high-risk exposure (e.g healthcare professionals) as well as persons with comorbidities (heart disease, diabetes, etc) and compromised immune systems. Ground-breaking in vitro studies demonstrate potential efficacy of hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic for novel coronavirus infection in primate cells.
Note: Hydroxychloroquine (brand name Plaquenil) is an inexpensive, globally available drug (tablet) that was approved for widespread medical use since 1955. It is commonly used today to treat malaria, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.
The study is part of the initiative from an independent group of scientists and physicians working on an open-data clinical trial for prevention of COVID-19, through the use of hydroxychloroquine in combination with other therapeutic agents. The group is now calling on President Trump to allow Americans to use the drug.
Unlike a typical commercial drug trial, the objective of the group is to share trial data with the public* and health-care professionals as close to real-time as possible (with a reasonable level of data quality assurance). Given the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic, the group is looking for every possible means to fast-track the effort. You can read their draft paper at https://www.covidtrial.io/"

The coronavirus has plunged the stock market over the past weeks. Stock valuations are nearing lows last seen since the Global Financial Crisis. While others panic, the successful investor would seize onto this great opportunity to buy great businesses at a cheap price.
First, we recognise that great businesses are resilient and will start reaping handsome profits once the economic downturn ceases. So identify high-quality businesses to invest in, never mind the prevailing fearful economic mood. But before investing during this COVID-19 crash, here are five things an investor should consider.
Note: This is neither a recommendation to purchase or sell any of the shares mentioned in this article, and the information here is for educational purposes and/or for study or research only.
1. Income vs growth
An important consideration before investing in the stock market is to decide whether you are investing for growth or income.
If you are investing for income, a number of Singapore stocks and REITs pay out pretty decent dividends. For example, if you invest in Netlink NBN Trust or Ascendas REIT, you can expect to reap an annual dividend yield of around 5.5% and 6.3% respectively (as of 20 March 2020). In fact, the recent comedown in Singapore REITs have seen their average yields rise as high as 10.5%. And unlike U.S. stocks, the dividends you receive from investing in SGX-listed stocks are tax free.
However, it is important to remember that a high dividend yield stock doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a good business. The plunging share price of a stock due to poor fundamentals can cause its dividend yield to look deceptively high.
If you are investing for growth, U.S. stocks like Amazon, Alphabet, and Facebook are fundamentally good businesses that would be resilient enough to bounce back even stronger from the COVID-19 crisis. Their room for growth is huge given their global reach and the economic moats they have established for themselves.
2. Home or foreign stocks
Another aspect you need to consider is your comfort level towards investing in overseas markets. While investing in your home market gives one the added advantage of localised knowledge, investing in foreign markets like the U.S. gives you huge growth opportunities that may not be possible in your home market.
For example, if you are going for capital gains rather than dividends, investing in U.S. stocks like Amazon gives one a lot more potential upside. The potential capital upside of Singapore companies is limited given the small domestic consumer base which they predominantly serve.
It’s fair enough to say that the choice between investing in the local and overseas market need not be a binary one, and you can always invest in both.
3. Capital allocation
If you prefer a dividend-leaning portfolio as opposed to a growth-oriented one, you could allocate 70% of your capital to dividend stocks and the rest to growth. The reverse is true if you prefer a growth-oriented portfolio. Keep in mind that which way you lean depends on your personal financial situation, investment goals, and risk profile.
You’d also want to diversify your portfolio across 10 stocks. In the book Modern Portfolio Theory and Investment Analysis, authors Edwin J. Elton and Martin J. Gruber concluded that portfolio volatility is reduced by 70% by owning six stocks in your portfolio, by 76% with 10 stocks, and by 81% with 20 stocks.
4. Stock valuation
Assuming you have done your due diligence and identified some great companies to invest in, the question is: When do you go in?
Remember, a low stock price does not always mean that the stock is undervalued. To find out, we need to have a look at a stock’s valuation. One way of valuing a stock is to compare its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio with its long-term historical average. It reflects how the market, as a collective, prices the stock with regards to its earnings.
For example, Apple’s historical average P/E over the last 10 years is 15.8. (Based on Apple’s latest annual earnings per share of US$12.66, that would give Apple an ‘intrinsic value’ of US$200.03.) As a value investor, we prefer to invest in Apple if it trades below its historical average; and especially when there’s a significant margin of safety. In Apple’s case, that would be near one standard deviation below the historical P/E average (12.3)."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=132","Mar 24, 2020 12:41 PM","WealthMaster","As you can tell, despite the recent crash in prices, Apple’s P/E is still above its historical average — because it was overpriced to begin with — and you may prefer to wait some more to see if Apple’s stock price corrects further.
5. Investing bit by bit
A black swan event in COVID-19 has sent the market spiralling downwards. Even if I invest with a margin of safety, the market could still be southward bound. In other words, I catch a falling knife. But it’s also hubristic to think I can anticipate when the market has bottomed.
So don’t invest all your capital at one go; deploy your capital in tranches. I’ll illustrate this point here:
Let’s say I have S$10,000 to invest and choose to allocate my capital equally among 10 stocks. That would mean I have $1,000 set aside for a single stock.
We can first invest 40% of our capital ($400) in a stock when it trades 10% below its intrinsic value. If the stock price falls another 10%, we deploy half of our remaining capital ($300). If the stock price falls another 10%, we deploy the rest of our remaining capital ($300).
However, unlike SGX-listed dividend stocks which can trade below S$1 per share, some U.S. companies like Amazon and Alphabet trade in excess of US$1,000 per share. In this case, given our limited capital, there’s no way we can deploy our investment using all three tranches, so you may have to make do with one or two.
Using lower cost brokerages like Interactive Brokers, Saxo Markets or FSMOne can also help to reduce fees when you’re deploying multiple tranches. For example, Saxo Markets charges a minimum of US$4 per trade for U.S. stocks (compared to US$20 for brokerages in Singapore), and FSMOne charges a minimum of S$10 per trade for Singapore stocks (compared to S$25 normally). You can compare the fees among brokerages when investing in Singapore, Malaysia, and the U.S. here.
The fifth perspective
It’s understandable why we are fearful in these uncertain times, but it’s also during these moments where the best opportunities arise. As long as you do your due diligence and pick high-quality companies to invest in during this market crash, you’ll be able to ride out the volatility and set your portfolio up for sizeable gains down the road.
In the immortal words of Warren Buffett:
‘Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.’"

Last week, the first volunteers in a study of an experimental COVID-19 vaccine received their first doses, and the vaccine’s developer, Moderna Therapeutics, is already thinking ahead. Although testing on the vaccine will take at least a year to complete, the work could provide valuable information about how the immune system can fight coronaviruses and could give scientists a head start if any new outbreaks of the virus were to occur.
Non-essential staff at Moderna Therapeutics’ manufacturing facility, in Norwood, Mass., including president Dr. Stephen Hoge, are working from home as recommended by public health officials, but those involved in manufacturing what may be the first vaccine against the novel coronavirus are ready to scale up production if the first phase of testing on the vaccine shows that it’s safe.
The vaccine will be studied first in a group of 45 healthy volunteers, who have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In this group, scientists are looking to see if the shots are safe, and to test three different dosages to see which seems to activate the strongest immune response. If these initial subjects don’t develop any severe side effects or reactions, then researchers will recruit hundreds more healthy volunteers to confirm those results,
For the first phase, Moderna shipped hundreds of vials of the test vaccine to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is overseeing the study in multiple centers in the US. For the next, says Hoge, “it will be several fold, maybe five-fold larger than the first phase. We are talking thousands of vials.”
And if the vaccine proves not just safe, but also successful, the company is preparing for an anticipated “incredible demand to scale up the vaccine very, very quickly,” Hoge says, “we have already started to do work to scale up to producing millions of doses.”
That’s made possible, in part, by the non-traditional technology used to make this particular vaccine. Moderna uses mRNA, a genetic form of the virus’ genome, in its vaccine. When it’s injected into people, cells then process it so immune cells can recognize it and target it for destruction. Unlike the processes used to make most traditional vaccines, this method does not require growing huge amounts of the virus, which is time-consuming.
It’s also why the vaccine was developed in record time. Chinese researchers first posted the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 in mid-January, and by Feb. 7, Moderna had vials of the vaccine ready for the standards-testing needed before the treatment could be cleared for human trials. By the last week of February, that was completed and the company sent vials to NIH for further review by its scientists. Then both Moderna and NIH filed for a request to the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates trials of experimental therapies, to start injecting the vaccine in people for human testing."

FOR the past several decades, Malaysia experienced several economic downturns such as the regional economic crisis of 1997.
During the slowdown, the economy slumped across several sectors such as in manufacturing and services.
Despite the sluggish growth, the people persevered and remained resilient. No matter how downcast the economic clouds were, the people ignored the naysayers and continued with their daily lives.
The people went about with their activities going out with their families for outings and meals. At the time, small businesses continued to open their doors and businesses thrived.
The people were the main drivers of the country's economy which provided the buffer against the global slowdown.
They provided the private consumption needed to shield the country from weak external demands such as waning exports of palm oil and electrical and electronics products.
Last year, the people stood pat against the erratic world economy exacerbated by the US-China trade war.
And now, the people's steadfastness are tested once again with the Covid-19 already wreaking havoc on the global and domestic fronts.
Never before has the country seen its shopping malls and towns so deserted due to the movement control order.
Due to the almost non-existent domestic economy, economists are concerned that the world, Malaysia included is headed for a recession.
S&P Global Ratings expected the global economy to enter into recession in 2020 and said a recession across Asia-Pacific is ""now guaranteed.""
To cushion this blow, Universiti Utara Malaysia Associate Professor of Economics Dr Irwan Shah Zainal Abidin said the government can unleash a second stimulus package with a bigger amount of RM50 billion.
""Money must be given directly to the people, especially the B40 and the M40 households group. Businesses which are directly affected must be given some help too.
""Then, new short and long term measures must be devised sooner rather than later to manage the expected spike in both the fiscal and debt levels,"" said Irwan.
Thus, it is comforting to hear that the government will convene as soon as the lockdown is over to discuss and roll out the second stimulus package.
Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin announced that the second stimulus package will be announced on March 30. The stimulant is imperative as it will act as a catalyst for the people to spend again.
In its research note, Kenanga Research said the second stimulus package could kickstart the country's growth while ensuring extra social security for the people to ride the challenging economic environment.
The government needs to rejuvenate the people's wallets so that they can spend again. Muhyiddin's announcement that Employee Provident Fund's contributors can withdraw RM500 per month for the next 12 months is also a much needed panacea.
He also announced a RM130 million injection for all small businesses to be distributed by all state governments. And now, with all these measures in place, the tenacity of the Malaysian people will be required once again.
Just like in 1997 and the economic crisis of 2007/2008, the unique spending habits of the Malaysian people will be needed once again to breathe life into the economy and defeat Covid-19.
Once the movement control order is over, the economy could regain its composure just like it was before."

PETALING JAYA: Another patient has died, bringing the Covid-19 death toll to 16 on Tuesday (March 24).
Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah in a Facebook post on Tuesday night said that the man's death has been reported to the National Crisis Preparedness and Response Centre.
“The 16th death, or patient 1,334, is a 75-year-old Malaysian with a history of several chronic illnesses.
“The individual started to show symptoms five days before being admitted to the Tuanku Mizan Military Hospital on March 16 and was later transferred to Hospital Kuala Lumpur on March 18.
“The individual’s health deteriorated and he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) to receive respiratory aid. He was confirmed to be Covid-19 positive on March 21.
“However, the individual died on March 24 at 7.40pm. The source of the individual’s infection is still under investigation,” he said.
Earlier, Dr Noor Hisham announced a total of 106 new cases were recorded on Tuesday, bringing the total to 1,624."

The Covid-19 news cycle seems be on 24 hours a day and that seems to be the most information i received every day in my WhatsApp or telegram group. In fact, it would seem to be the most dominating headline of our every day life. The question in my mind was why now? Why finally after so many long months only we are at this point? Was it ignorance, optimism, or wilful blindness?
But enough of Covid-19, I am sure most are sick and tired of this. Let me focus on what matters, how to make the most of the current situation. When Malaysia was a tiger economy in the 1990s until end of the millennium, the crisis hit us hard due to the Asian financial crisis. It took Southeast Asia economy almost 20 years to be on a sound footing.
Many have said, finally, this is it, recession. The recession they have predicted finally arrived. Some predicted it to arrive since 2013. I remember a very big fund listed on our share market was one of those. Well, surely a broken clock may be right once a day. The question is not about being right but if you are right, what are you going to do about it? This is the same thing I ask myself every single night before going to bed (second last thing is observing global markets indicators). Are we willing to pull the trigger?
The reason why heroes are so well loved because there are few and hard to come by. I believe once this whole entire episode is over, there will be only a handful that people will sing about. Specifically about their success in making the most of this frightening times. So let me share few simple viewpoints and of course some of our actions taken in this climate. I do not believe we will be right but if anything, history have taught us well and we should always head back to history to guide us especially in the times of uncertainty and great crisis. I believe this is a major crisis and especially so unexpected to the start of a new decade.
1. What rises will fall & similarly what has fallen will rise :
With the triple whammy of political instability, oil plunge and Covid-19, the perfect storm has come to the shores of Malaysia. None can escape unscathed. Now when the market is on a bull run, we think it will keep going up. Ex: At 15x PE, analysts say its cheap comparing to global peers which valuations stands at 25x. Today, those so-called cheap laggard counters are actually down to a valuation of only 4-6x PE valuation. True it is unfair to generalise as it is a downtrodden market affected even the best investors in the world. However this is a reflection of the market sentiment and investor confidence."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=133","Mar 25, 2020 12:18 PM","WealthMaster","Now if you compare the major dips from the peak to the bottom in 1997 - (1250 to 500), 2008 - (1400 to 800), & today 2020 - (1900 to 1219), it would appear there may be still some down side. On average each crisis, it falls close to or more than 50% from the peak of the market. Also you will notice the timeframe of recovery is between 6 months - 12 months from the bottom. 2008 was more of a V shape rebound compared to U shape rebound for 1997. Would 2020 crisis be a V or U shaped? In my view, it would be a U-shaped if the vaccine is not created sooner than later. After all, since the explosion of epidemic in Wuhan, China till today, it has been almost 4 months.
The important difference is this, so far there is no mass layoff yet and no street protest or unrest for Malaysia. Also, BNM is still solid and fundamentally sound compared to back in 1997. However, all this will get out of control if the new Government do not get their actions together to formulate a proper way out for the country. Remember, there is still shortfall from GST, shortfall from oil plunge income for the national coffers, increasing budget deficit, high debt outstanding from 1MDB amongst the many other issues we have yet to resolve. With limited fiscal room for the Government to manoeuvre, there is a risk our MGS will become less attractive for foreign funds especially with this global sell down, foreign funds as more choice than before where the global markets having lofty valuations compared to Malaysia.
2. Statesmanship to Lead the Country out of Turmoil :
One of the most notable effort by our country leaders during the 1997 crisis was to implement capital control to help us out. Shortly in 1 year, Malaysia was back on growth track. Till today, many dispute this decision by our Govt then. It wasn't until much later that international community praised Malaysia government in rejecting IMF money by pegging Ringgit against USD.
The fact of that matter is today, we do not have the leader of comparable calibre to lead us, be it in terms of government policy or economic policy. The backdoor government only cares about their own position and power and in the midst of the Covid-19 played a terrible political play for their own personal interest leading to the spike in cases due to lapse in supervision and control measures implement.
Many things could have been prevented and many rescue plans could have been formulated if the government was still operating, not a window of 2 week coupled with further effort spent on politicking, trade bartering and on boarding for new / old but incompetent ministers. This is my biggest concern as I believe the international community will find a resolution to the virus but the aftermath will have long lasting effect on the country whereby the economy will take a long time to rebound due to poor leadership."

On 14 March, 1600+ from Tabligh reported to have breathing difficulty. I estimate the gov test 100-200 of them daily. Not really sure how many GH can test per day, but I don't think it can be quick. By counting the date, most of them have been tested by now. What we see from now maybe from the second wave, the friends and relatives of those 1600+ and those from 12500 attendees who ran away hiding.

HONG KONG: China stocks hit a one-week high on Wednesday on hopes that the U.S. Congress would pump trillions of dollars to support the world's largest economy during the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic.
Also helping sentiment, Mainland China reported a drop in new confirmed coronavirus cases on Wednesday as imported infections fell and no locally transmitted infections were reported.

1. I wish to officially put on record our appreciation to the doctors, nurses, health workers, Immigration and other front liners protecting Malaysia from the COVID-19 outbreak. The COVID-19 outbreak has been well contained with most of those infected having recovered fully.
2. Eventhough COVID-19 has been well contained, the disease has a significant impact on the global economy and Malaysia.
3. Therefore, the Government will introduce the 2020 Economic Stimulus Package to ensure economic risks associated with the outbreak are effectively addressed. Various strategies have been formulated to ensure that Malaysian economy remains on strong foundations.
The RM20 billion economic stimulus package
4. The stimulus package valued at RM20 billion is anchored on three strategies as follows:
Strategy I: Mitigating impact of COVID-19;
Strategy II: Spurring rakyat centric economic growth; and
Strategy III: Promoting quality investments
Strategy I: Mitigating impact of COVID-19
5. The most immediate economic impact of COVID-19 has been the sharp decline in tourist arrivals throughout the region. Hotels, airlines, travel companies and more broadly the tourism-dependent retail industry have been badly affected.
6. To mitigate the impact, the Government will implement a three-pronged approach — first, to ease the cash flow of affected businesses, second, to assist affected individuals, and third, to stimulate demand for travel and tourism.
Easing cashflow
7. To assist businesses most adversely affected, the Government proposes for a period of 6 months beginning from April until September 2020:
First: To allow deferment of monthly income tax instalment payments for businesses in the tourism sector. In addition, companies affected by the COVID-19 to be allowed to revise their profit estimates for 2020 with respect to monthly income tax instalment payments without penalty;
Second: To provide 15% discount in monthly electricity bills to hotels, travel agencies, airlines, shopping malls, conventions and exhibitions centres;
Third: To exempt Human Resource Development Fund (HRDF) levies for hotels and travel-related companies; and
Fourth: To exempt the 6% service tax for hotels. However, this exemption will be made effective earlier, that is from March to August 2020.
8. The Government will also provide financing facilities for affected companies, as follows:
First: Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) will provide a Special Relief facility worth RM2 billion, particularly in the form of working capital for Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) at an interest rate of 3.75%; and
Second: Bank Simpanan Nasional (BSN) will allocate RM200 million in microcredit facility offering an interest rate of 4% to affected businesses. In addition, the approval process for existing loan funds will be further streamlined such as Bank Pembangunan’s Tourism Infrastructure Fund of RM1.5 billion.
9. All banks are required to provide financial relief in the form of payment moratorium comprising restructuring and rescheduling loans for affected businesses and individuals. BNM is tasked to ensure that all financial institutions will assist all companies in need without exception.
10. In the spirit of shared responsibility to overcome current challenges, the Government calls on industry players to play their part — for hotels to offer discounts and shopping malls to reduce rentals to their tenants.
11. Malaysia Airport Holdings Berhad (MAHB) will provide rebates on rental for premises at the airport as well as landing and parking charges.
Assistance for affected individuals
12. The Government acknowledges lower tourist arrivals has negatively impacted those reliant on tourism. The Government will give a one-off payment of RM600 each to taxi drivers, tourist bus drivers, tourist guides and registered trishaw drivers.
13. As a sign of appreciation to those in the front line protecting Malaysia from the contagion, Government staff directly involved in the containment efforts will be eligible for a special monthly critical allowance of RM400 for medical doctors and other medical personnel, as well as RM200 for immigration and related front line staff commencing February 2020 until the end of pandemic.
14. To date, the Ministry of Health has committed RM150 million to purchase the relevant equipment, medicine and consumables in the effort to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. The Government will provide the necessary resources to ensure the COVID-19 outbreak is well managed."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=133","Mar 27, 2020 3:06 PM","Wellington Sky","Human capital development
15. The Government encourages employers to further invest in raising the productivity of human capital during this economic slowdown period.
Towards this, the Government will provide double deduction on expenses incurred on approved tourism-related training. The Government will also provide up to RM100 million on a matching grant basis to HRDF to fund an additional 40,000 employees from the tourism and other affected sectors.
16. The Government will also provide RM50 million to subsidise short courses in digital skills and highly skilled courses. This incentive is expected to benefit 100,000 Malaysians.
17. The Malaysian workers retrenched can rely on the Employment Insurance System (EIS) with a current fund of RM1.1 billion. Furthermore, EIS will increase the claimable training cost from RM4,000 to RM6,000 for the affected sectors. A daily training allowance of RM30 per day will also be provided to trainees under EIS.
Stimulate tourism sector
18. To stimulate tourism industry, the Government will introduce initiatives as follows:
First: personal income tax relief of up to RM1,000 on expenditure related to domestic tourism;
Second: All Malaysians will be eligible for digital vouchers for domestic tourism of up to RM100 per person for domestic flights, railway and hotel accommodation. Additional matching grants for tourism promotion will be provided. An allocation of RM500 million is provided for the vouchers and tourism promotion; and
Third: Relaxation of existing guidelines limiting use of hotels by Government agencies as part of mitigating the reduced demand.
Strategy II : Catalysing rakyat centric economic growth rakyat’s assistance
19. The effects of COVID-19 reverberate beyond the tourism industry. Malaysian businesses, especially exporters are affected by supply chain disruptions involving factories and ports in China.
20. Therefore, the Government will carry out immediate measures to boost local consumption growth to cushion the effect of negative external factors, while protecting local Malaysian jobs. These measures include:
First: the minimum Employees Provident Fund (EPF) contribution by employees will be reduced by 4% from 11% to 7%, with effect from 1 April 2020 to 31 December 2020. This will potentially unlock up to RM10 billion worth of private consumption.
Malaysian workers have the option to opt out from the scheme and maintain their contribution rate.
Second: a payment of RM200 to all Bantuan Sara Hidup (BSH) recipients scheduled for May 2020 will be brought forward to March 2020.
Third: an additional RM100 will be paid into the bank accounts of all BSH recipients in May 2020. Subsequently, an additional RM50 will be channelled in the form of e-tunai.
21. To enhance the income of rakyat and reduce cost of living, the Government will undertake the following initiatives:
First: Agrofood facility of RM1 billion will be provided by BNM at an interest cost of 3.75% to promote food production activities to meet domestic and export demand.
Second: RM10 million allocation to FAMA to provide food storage facilities to help reduce food prices.
Third: Grants of RM1,000 to 10,000 local entrepreneurs to promote sale of their products on e-commerce platforms.
Fourth: Allocation of RM20 million to Malaysian Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC) for Perkhidmatan e-Dagang Setempat (PeDAS) programme to transform Pusat Internet Desa into e-commerce hubs.
Rural stimulus
22. The Government will allocate an additional RM2 billion for the immediate implementation of small infrastructure repair and upgrading projects nationwide especially in rural areas. To ensure that the projects are effectively implemented for the benefit of the rakyat, the allocations will be channelled in partnership with State Governments, local authorities, NGOs and local communities.
23. The projects need to be implemented expeditiously in order to give positive impact in stimulating the economy. To expedite the implementation of all projects, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) will provide special relaxation on financial procedures for the year 2020 as follows:
First: Increase procurement threshold value for balloting from RM50,000 to RM100,000 and for quotations from RM500,000 to RM800,000;
Second: Ensure Ministries channel sufficient allocations to
respective implementing agencies by first quarter of 2020. MoF will oversee the compliance to procurement schedule to ensure projects are undertaken on a timely basis.
Strategy III: Promoting quality investments
24. To bolster business confidence, the Government is committed to sustaining public investments and in particular, expedite in 2020 the tenders and implementation of development expenditure projects.
25. In addition, agencies and Government linked companies (GLCs) will also accelerate planned investment projects for 2020, including:"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=133","Mar 27, 2020 3:06 PM","Wellington Sky","First: Ministry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment
and Climate Change (MESTECC) will open for bids quota of 1,400MW for solar power generation. This is expected to involve RM5 billion of private investments and generate 25,000 jobs;
Second: Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) will implement up to RM3 billion on works related to the National Fiberisation and Connectivity Plan (NFCP); and
Third: GLCs such as TNB will invest RM13 billion in 2020, including accelerating projects such as LED street lights, transmission lines and rooftop solar installations.
26. To enhance greater national competitiveness, the Government will promote higher value-added private sector investments through:
First: A Co-Investment fund of RM500 million to be co-invested and matched by private investors on a ratio of at least 1 to 3 which will make the total funds amount to RM2 billion for investment in early-stage and growth-stage Malaysian companies;
Second: waiving of the listing fees by Securities Commission and Bursa Malaysia for one year for companies seeking listing on Leading Entrepreneur Accelerator Platform (LEAP) or Access, Certainty, Efficiency (ACE) markets, as well as companies with market capitalisation of less than RM500 million seeking listing on the Main Market;
Third: BNM will provide an SME Automation & Digitalization Facility of RM300 million at an interest cost of 3.75%;
Fourth: the Government will provide accelerated capital allowances over a two-year period on expenses incurred on machinery and equipment including ICT;
Fifth: The Government will provide a tax deduction of up to RM300,000 on renovation and refurbishment cost; and
Sixth: Import duty and sales tax exemption on importation or local purchase of machinery and equipment used in port operations for 3 years commencing 1 April 2020.
Closing
27. In 2003, Malaysia experienced a similar situation with the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that began in East Asia, tourist arrivals plunged regionally. That played a role in bringing Malaysia’s quarterly Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth down from 7.1% in the third quarter of 2002 to 4.6% in the same quarter a year later. However, as a result of the comprehensive economic stimulus package, Malaysian economy recovered to 6.5% in the fourth quarter of 2003. Insya-Allah, the 2020 economic stimulus package will be as successful.
28. Due to the global economic scenario and COVID-19 impact, Malaysia’s GDP growth in 2020 is estimated to be in the range of 3.2% to 4.2%. I believe, the economic stimulus package will enable the Malaysian economy to achieve the highest point of the range. In formulating the stimulus package, the Government exercised prudence with respect to its fiscal position. As a result of the stimulus package, fiscal deficit is estimated to slightly increase to 3.4% of GDP compared with the original
target of 3.2% of GDP.
29. The Government is cognisant that the implementation of the economic stimulus package cannot be successfully delivered by the Government alone. Therefore, the Government calls on the private sector to play their part in ensuring the stimulus package is successful.
30. At the same time, the Government calls on the rakyat to remain steadfast, brave and diligent in prevailing over the current challenges and emerge even stronger after this episode.
31. Insya-Allah, with the cooperation, persistent effort and solid identity, our beloved nation will become more prosperous and resilient.
Thank you."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=134","Mar 30, 2020 12:09 PM","Wishingwells","LONDON, March 29 — The United Kingdom will do well if it manages to keep the coronavirus death toll below 20,000, a senior health official said yesterday after the deadliest day so far of the outbreak saw the number of fatalities rise to more than 1,000.
Stephen Powis, the medical director of National Health Service England, warned the public against complacency and said everyone had to play their part in hindering the spread of the virus.
The number of confirmed cases stood at 17,089 on Saturday morning. The death toll rose by 260 in a day to 1,019, the seventh highest toll in the world behind Italy, Spain, China, Iran, France and the United States.
When asked if Britain was on the same trajectory as Italy, where the death toll has passed 9,000, Powis said that if the public adhered to the nationwide lockdown the total toll could be kept below 20,000.
“If it is less than 20,000... that would be a good result though every death is a tragedy, but we should not be complacent about that,” he said at a news conference in Downing Street.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson became the first leader of a major power to announce a positive test result for coronavirus on Friday. He is self-isolating in Downing Street but still leading the UK response to the crisis.
Britain is bracing for the epidemic to peak in the coming weeks, and is building field hospitals in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Cardiff to bolster its state-run National Health Service (NHS).
The government, which had been criticised by some doctors and nurses for not providing them with enough protective gear and testing kits, said on Friday it was introducing a much bigger testing regime, with checks for health workers in England.
Frontline medical staff in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are already being tested.
Coronavirus in government
As the British government urged the public to stay indoors, the virus struck at Downing Street itself. Besides Johnson, health minister Matt Hancock has also tested positive and chief medical adviser Chris Whitty is self-isolating with symptoms.
The minister for Scotland, Alister Jack, said yesterday he had developed a temperature and a cough in the past 24 hours and was now working from home in isolation. He has not been tested for coronavirus.
Jack spoke in the House of Commons on Wednesday, immediately before Johnson appeared at the weekly Prime Minister's Questions session, during which Jack was seated on the government bench behind Johnson.
Efforts were under way to keep building up the NHS's ability to cope.
Hospitals have been rushing to increase intensive care capacity, including by turning operating theatres and recovery areas into beds for critically ill patients.
“At the moment, I am confident the capacity is there,” Powis said. “We have not reached capacity.”
A drive-through coronavirus testing facility for health workers has begun operating in the car park of the Chessington World of Adventures theme park near London.
Health workers, who remain in their cars, are tested by nurses who carry out swabs in the nose and mouth through the windows."

~ Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, chief U.S. equity strategist at JPMorgan, expects the S&P 500 to reach 3,400 in early 2021.
~ That would top an all-time high of 3,386 set on Feb. 19. It is also 47% higher than the broad market average’s Friday close of 2,304.92.
~ “Acknowledging that equity markets globally are now down 30-50% from their recent highs ... we see an asymmetrical return profile for equities with upside significantly higher than downside over the next year,” he says.
The S&P 500 could return to record highs by early next year if U.S. efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak work and the government can quickly move forward with fiscal stimulus to cushion the impending economic blow, JPMorgan’s chief U.S. equity strategist said Friday.
Dubravko Lakos-Bujas wrote in a note to clients he expects the S&P 500 to reach 3,400 in early 2021. That would top an all-time high of 3,386 set on Feb. 19. It is also 47% higher than the broad market average’s Friday close of 2,304.92.
The S&P 500 entered a bear market on March 12 — bringing the longest-ever bull expansion to an abrupt end — as the fast spread of the coronavirus and resulting shutdowns soured economic and profit growth forecasts around the world. However, after the relentless selling wave, Lakos-Bujas now sees a chance for stocks to return to record levels.
“Acknowledging that equity markets globally are now down 30-50% from their recent highs, and that investor positioning has become increasingly favorable, we see an asymmetrical return profile for equities with upside significantly higher than downside over the next year,” Lakos-Bujas wrote.
For his scenario to play out, though, the U.S. government must pass a “comprehensive fiscal package promptly.”
The White House is currently seeking more than $1 trillion in government stimulus to soften the virus’ economic hit. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday the administration wants to send direct payments to U.S. kids and adults as part of that package. Those payments would total about $500 billion. Several industry groups — particularly airlines — are also seeking relief money.
“Aggressive fiscal policy needs to be undertaken immediately,” Lakos-Bujas said, noting that failure to pass such measures “would likely result in a broader capitulation of equities including the heavyweight momentum stocks.”
The other side of the equation is curbing the coronavirus spread in the U.S. More than 15,000 cases have been confirmed in the U.S. along with over 200 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Authorities in the U.S. have imposed measures to contain the number of cases and “flatten the curve,” which would keep the country’s health care system from being overrun by the outbreak.
“The spread of the outbreak in the US will still remain a key concern,” the strategist said. “At the same time, there are early signs of progress being made of potential anti-viral treatment, though the outcome is still uncertain.”"

The Federal Reserve said Monday it will launch a barrage of programs aimed at helping markets function more efficiently in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.
Among the initiatives is a commitment to continue its asset purchasing program “in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions and the economy.”
Others include a $300 billion lending program for Main Street businesses and the Term Asset-Backed Loan Facility implemented during the financial crisis.
Markets reacted positively to the moves, cutting most of the losses in stock market futures that had once been “limit down” in overnight trading.
The Fed also said it will purchase agency commercial mortgage-backed securities as part of an expansion in its asset purchases, known in the market as quantitative easing. The move represents an expansion into the commercial sector of real estate for the central bank’s acquisitions.
“We are now in QE infinity, again,” Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said in a note.
The measures come on top of programs the central bank announced last week aimed at easing the flow of credit markets and the short-term finding that banks need to operate.
“The coronavirus pandemic is causing tremendous hardship across the United States and around the world. Our nation’s first priority is to care for those afflicted and to limit the further spread of the virus,” the Fed said in a statement. “While great uncertainty remains, it has become clear that our economy will face severe disruptions. Aggressive efforts must be taken across the public and private sectors to limit the losses to jobs and incomes and to promote a swift recovery once the disruptions abate.”
Monday’s announcement represents the most aggressive market intervention the Fed has made to date.
Previously, it had announced it would buy $500 billion worth of Treasurys and $200 billion in MBS. The new move represents an open-ended commitment to the QE program.
Oil reverses losses, jumps 4% after Fed promises aggressive asset purchases to support markets
Oil prices reversed losses on Monday, jumping 4% after the Federal Reserve promised aggressive asset purchases to support markets. The move higher comes after U.S. West Texas Intermediate crudeposted its worst week since 1991.

U.S. stocks had the best day in almost a dozen years as investors rediscovered their appetite for risk with Congress closing in on an unprecedented spending bill to prop up the slumping economy. The dollar halted a 10-day winning streak.
The S&P 500 rebounded from the lowest level since 2016, notching a third straight Tuesday turnaround -- and the biggest one-day gain since October 2008 -- after starting the week with a rout. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 11% to clock its biggest advance since 1933.
Lawmakers are negotiating the final sticking points in a roughly $2 trillion stimulus bill to help the U.S. economy get through the coronavirus pandemic, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was hopeful a deal could be reached today.
“U.S. equities are responding to the possibility of this gargantuan fiscal stimulus package and some certainty in the political situation,” Stephen Dover, head of equities at Franklin Templeton, said in a phone interview.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index also surged, led by health-care and industrial companies, even as data began to show the extent of economic damage to the region from the coronavirus pandemic. Benchmarks across Asia jumped, with Korea’s index soaring almost 9% after the government announced measures to stabilize markets.
The dollar slumped against developed and emerging currencies alike, in a tentative sign of reduced stress after the greenback’s steepest appreciation since the global financial crisis and longest winning streak since 2012. European bonds tracked Treasuries lower.
About $26 trillion has evaporated from equity markets since mid-February, and investors have been left sifting the wreckage and weigh the chances of a lasting rebound. On the one hand, Wall Street has begun to argue that liquidations are nearing an end with real-money investors like pension funds ready to step in, and there are signs of improvement in some of world’s regions that were hardest-hit by the virus. On the other, the number of infections globally continues to accelerate and many of the largest economies are grinding to a halt.
Tuesday’s gain in risk assets follows an unprecedented move by the Federal Reserve to backstop large swaths of the financial system. Still, key gauges of U.S. manufacturing and services in March fell the most on record, suggesting the deep toll the pandemic has already taken.
“Sentiment has improved, but to call it a turning point is too strong a word for now,” said James McCormick, global head of desk strategy at NatWest Markets. “It is more of a tug-of-war. Policy bazooka is in place, but will be fighting against very weak data and still worrying trends on Covid-19 data. We are more neutral on risk assets now.”
Elsewhere, emerging-market stocks jumped alongside their currencies. Gold extended recent a recent surge and industrial metals rallied."

~ The White House and Senate leaders reached a deal early Wednesday on a massive $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill to combat the economic impact of the outbreak, NBC News reports.
~ Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin agreed to enhanced oversight of a $500 billion bailout fund that Democrats had criticized, according to a senior administration official.
~ One of the key issues that had yet to be resolved is the terms of the airline aid and oversight that comes with it, two sources said.
The White House and Senate leaders reached a deal early Wednesday on a massive $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill to combat the economic impact of the outbreak, NBC News reports.
On Tuesday, leaders in both parties had said that they were closing in on an agreement. Multiple people familiar with the situation told CNBC that they were still close to a deal, although talks continued as they worked through the text and hashed out final details. Two of the people had cautioned that talks could spill into Wednesday morning.
One of the key issues was the terms of the airline aid and oversight that comes with it, two of the people said. Democrats have pushed for a number of stipulations along with aid to the industry, including longterm bans on stock buybacks, limits on executive compensation, commitments not to furlough workers and board representation.
Meantime, President Donald Trump stressed in a press conference Tuesday that the money the U.S. lends “will be coming back” to it. The airlines have pushed for half of their aid in grants, arguing debt from loans would be too onerous.
One of the sources said there continued to be questions around oversight of the $500 billion fund that Republicans have proposed to support distressed companies. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said the Federal Reserve could leverage the loans in the fund to offer up to $4 trillion in financing. The mechanics, though, are still in question, said the source.
Democrats, still angry over the leeway banks got in the 2008 bank bailout, have argued the fund gives the Treasury too much discretion. One option being considered is a weekly check-in with companies borrowing from the fund, the source said.
Still, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow all spoke optimistically about the fund Tuesday. They said there are plans to add more oversight to that fund, with the addition of an oversight board and an inspector general.
“It will be completely transparent,” Kudlow said at a coronavirus task force briefing Tuesday at the White House.
Schumer had earlier in the day indicated in a speech on the Senate floor the fund was a key focus for Democrats.
Still, the two parties have worked already worked through a number of disagreements.
For the Democrats, that includes securing more funding for hospitals, and a state and local stimulus fund as part of their “Marshall Plan.” Schumer touted on the Senate floor unemployment insurance on steroids, which promised beneficiaries insurance for four months.
A draft bill from early Tuesday afternoon has had language stipulating a $350 billion fund for small businesses to mitigate layoffs and support payroll.
It also offered cash payments of up to $1,200 for individuals, $2,400 for married couples and $500 per child. Those amounts are reduced if an individual makes more than $75,000 or a couple makes more than $150,000.
President Donald Trump, describing the proposal as a $2 trillion package, said Tuesday that “we are working to pass the biggest and boldest financial relief package in American history.”"

If you didn’t already start hedging against the risk of a deep sell-off in credit markets last month, don’t bother now.
Ville Talasmaki, who helps manage about $16 billion of credit investments for Finnish financial group Sampo Oyj, says the warning signs had been plain for a while.
“There’s not much you can do to hedge yourself against the crisis anymore,” Talasmaki said by phone. “All the wise decisions should have been made in February and before that when you had all the warning signs and red flags waving in front of you.”
With panic setting in as the fallout of the coronavirus spreads, the market appears no longer to be functioning rationally. As a result, good-value corporate bonds have been being dumped indiscriminately, Talasmaki said.
For the risky end of the debt market -- high-yield bonds and leveraged loans -- “it’s brutal out there; overall, the picture is one in which “you’ve thrown out the baby with the bath water,” Talasmaki said.
Now, with historic stimulus packages unveiled by the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve, there are signs that sentiment is improving. For higher rated credits in particular, the panic appears to have subsided.
“As long as the liquidity backstop by the ECB is credible, then the risk is low for this to become a full-blown risk or a catastrophe in Europe,” Talasmaki said.
The next step as an investor is to be ready to buy when the recovery sets in.
“History has taught us that the first investments after the crisis are the best ones,” Talasmaki said. “Ones where the issuer is forced to pay a higher price, a premium, for accessing the market.”"

~ Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke expressed optimism about the longer-term picture for the U.S. economy.
~ While the country is in for a “sharp, short” recession,” he sees a “fairly quick rebound” ahead.
~ Bernanke guided the Fed during the financial crisis and accompanying Great Recession.
Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke sounded an optimistic tone on the longer-term state of the economy, predicting in a CNBC interview Wednesday that while the U.S. is facing an acute recession, it shouldn’t last.
“It is possible there’s going to be a very sharp, short, I hope short, recession in the next quarter because everything is shutting down of course,” he said on “Squawk Box.”
“If there’s not too much damage done to the workforce, to the businesses during the shutdown period, however long that may be, then we could see a fairly quick rebound.”
During the financial crisis that exploded in 2008, Bernanke guided the Fed through its efforts to save the economy. He was the first central bank chairman to pull its benchmark interest rate down to near zero, and the Bernanke Fed implemented a slew of programs that have been resurrected to deal with the current crisis.
While he guided the Fed through the financial crisis and accompanying Great Recession and is recognized authority on the Great Depression, he said the current situation bears only minor resemblance to those two periods.
“This is a very different animal from the Great Depression” which he said “came from human problems, monetary and financial shocks. This is has some of the same feel, some of the feel of panic, some of the feel of volatility that you’re talking about. It’s much closer to a major snowstorm or a natural disaster than a classic 1930′s-style depression.”
In fact, he said, the current situation is almost the opposite of the financial crisis, where problems in the banking system infected the broader economy. This time, issues in the broader economy brought on by the coronavirus are infecting the banks.
He stressed the important of getting the coronavirus itself under control so that policy can do its work.
“Nothing is going to work, the Fed is not going help, fiscal policy is not going to help if we don’t get the public health right, if we don’t solve the problem of the virus, of the infection, so making sure that the risk has declined sufficiently before put people back in the line of fire,” Bernanke said.
“So I think the public health is the most important one,” he added. “If we can get that straight, then we know how to get the economy working again. Monetary and fiscal policy can do their thing and we won’t have anything like the extended downturn we saw even, I don’t think, in the Great Recession, much less the Great Depression of the ’30s.”
Earlier Wednesday, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard expressed similar sentimentsabout the economy, telling CNBC he expects a big short-term hit but a strong rebound.
He praised the work being done by Chairman Jerome Powell and the rest of the current Fed.
The Powell Fed has pulled benchmark borrowing rates down to near-zero and implemented a slew of programs aimed at keeping liquidity flowing to the financial system and businesses.
“I think the Fed has been extremely proactive, and Jay Powell and his team have been working really hard and gotten ahead of this and shown they can set up a whole bunch of diverse programs that will help us keep the economy functioning during this shutdown period, so that when the all-clear is sounded, we will have a much better rebound than we otherwise would,” Bernanke said."

~ The Senate passes a $2 trillion economic relief package to respond to the coronavirus pandemic.
~ It now heads to the House, which hopes to approve it by Friday.
~ The legislation, approved as waves of layoffs hit workers and hospitals look for resources, may not be the last action Congress takes to help a reeling economy and health care system.
The Senate passed a historic $2 trillion coronavirus relief package Wednesday night, as it tries to stem the destruction the pandemic has brought to American lives and wallets.
The chamber approved the mammoth bill in a unanimous 96-0 vote after days of furious negotiations, partisan sniping and raised tempers on the Senate floor. The bill now heads to the House, which will push to pass it by voice vote Friday morning as most representatives are out of Washington.
“This is a proud moment for the United States Senate and for the country and we’re going to win this battle in the very near future,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters after the vote.
The 880-page legislation includes direct payments to individuals, stronger unemployment insurance, loans and grants to businesses and more health care resources for hospitals, states and municipalities. It includes requirements that insurance providers cover preventive services for the coronavirus disease COVID-19.
The Senate rushed to pass the sweeping aid bill as data are expected to show a historic spike in unemployment claims after businesses across the country shuttered to try to slow the outbreak’s spread. Some hospitals have started to buckle under a flood of patients, asking for critical supplies such as masks and ventilators.
Coronavirus cases in the U.S. number more than 68,000, while deaths have now topped 1,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
The chamber approved the plan to combat the outbreak as the crisis started to thin its ranks. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., did not vote after testing positive for COVID-19, and neither did GOP Sens. Mitt Romney and Mike Lee of Utah, both in isolation after contact with their colleague. Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota senator and second-ranking Republican, also missed the vote after feeling ill.
While the Senate took precautions Wednesday such as keeping votes open longer to reduce crowding, senators still huddled in groups and chatted.
Speaking before the chamber passed the bill, McConnell said the Senate would not return until April 20. However, he said lawmakers would be “nimble” as the evolving crisis could force further action to boost the American economy or health care system.
“If circumstances require the Senate to return for a vote sooner than April the 20th we will provide at least 24 hours of notice,” he said.
Before passing the bill, the Senate first rejected an amendment proposed by Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., to cap unemployment insurance at a recipient’s previous wages. The bill adds $600 per week to the benefits a recipient would normally get for up to four months. Sasse’s amendment failed in a 48-48 vote.
The senator and three of his GOP colleagues threatened to delay passage of the legislation if they could not get a vote on an amendment. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., then suggested he could hold up the bill’s approval if they did not back down from their opposition.
While the snag caused fears the bill would not pass, hitting U.S. stock indexes just before markets closed Wednesday, it ultimately did not stop the Senate from approving the proposal.
In a letter to colleagues Wednesday night, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said the chamber will convene at 9 a.m. Friday to consider the legislation. The Maryland Democrat said that “in order to protect the safety” of representatives and staff and “prevent the further spread of COVID-19,” he and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., expect the House will take a voice vote.
“Members who want to come to the House Floor to debate this bill will be able to do so. In addition, we are working to ensure that those who are unable to return to Washington may express their views on this legislation remotely,” he wrote.
House approval would send the package to President Donald Trump’s desk. He has expressed support for the agreement his Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin negotiated with Senate Republicans and Democrats.
During a White House coronavirus briefing Wednesday, Trump said he would sign the legislation “immediately” after Congress passes it."

The measures are aimed at mitigating the forced selling pressure on the market, as well as safeguarding investors’ interest in respect to those who have pledged their shares for financing,"" the exchange regulator said in a circular to POs this evening.
These flexibilities may also allow investors to provide other types of collateral for purposes of margin financing, as may be necessary, it said.
To facilitate these measures, it has temporarily modified the relevant provisions of the Rules and Directives of Bursa Malaysia.
In particular, Rule 7.30(12) - which dictates that the PO must liquidate the client’s margin account in the event that the equity in the account falls below 130% of the outstanding balance - has been modified to remove the mandatory liquidation requirement. So, the PO now has the discretion to decide whether to liquidate the margin account or otherwise, in accordance with its credit policy.
As such, the provision in Rule 7.30(14), which states that no further margin financing can be extended following the events stated in the rule above, has been waived for consistency.
Besides that, it is no longer mandatory for a PO to request for additional margin, and to impose haircuts on any collateral and securities purchased and carried in margin accounts upon the occurrence of: i) unusual rapid changes in value of the securities, ii) the non-existence of an active market for the securities, iii) suspension of the securities from trading, or, iv) no possibility of immediate liquidation for the securities.
“A PO will instead have the discretion to decide whether to request such additional margin or impose a haircut, in accordance with its credit policy,” it said. This is a modification to Rule 7.30(19).
The bourse also modified a paragraph which requires the assignment of zero value to all other types of collateral. Instead, a PO must now refer to its credit policy in assigning a value to other types of collateral, including bonds, collective investment schemes, unit trusts, gold and immovable properties.
The waiver and modification of these rulings will take effect tomorrow (March 27) until Sept 30, 2020.
The bourse also took note of the extended Movement Control Order (MCO) and encouraged all POs, which provide counter service to their clients and customers, to limit their respective counter service hours to between 10am to 3pm during business days."

China and the U.S. aim to work more closely together in light of the spread of the coronavirus, leaders of both countries said in a phone call Friday Beijing time.
U.S. President Donald Trump said in a tweet that he spoke with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping “in great detail” about the COVID-19 pandemic, which has so far killed more than 24,000 people globally.
“China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the virus,” Trump said on Twitter. “We are working closely together. Much respect!”
The phone conversation followed a video conference meeting of G-20 leaders during which Xi gave a speech calling for greater international cooperation.
In the call with Trump, Xi said that U.S.-China relations are at a critical juncture, and hoped the U.S. would make substantial action in improving the relationship, according to a Chinese-language state media report translated by CNBC.
“The Chinese side is willing to continue to provide information and experience with the U.S. without reservation,” the report of Xi’s comments said.
The Chinese state media report of the call noted Trump said China’s experience gave him “great inspiration.”"

~ Conditions for market stabilization, revival mostly met: JPM
~ Most risky assets should trade higher in next quarter: Normand
Strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. have concluded that most risk assets -- a universe that typically includes stocks and credit -- have seen their low points for the recession that’s gripped economies around the world.
Conditions that JPMorgan had set for market stabilization and revival have largely been met, with recession-like pricing, a reversal in investor positioning and extraordinary fiscal stimulus, strategists led by John Normand wrote in a note Friday. Coronavirus infection rates remain a “wild card,” as they remain high even if they’re “slowing” in the U.S. and Europe.
“Risky markets should remain volatile as long as infection rates create uncertainty about the depth and duration of the Covid recession, but enough has changed fundamentally and technically to justify adding risk selectively,” Normand wrote. “Most risky markets have probably made their lows for this recession, except perhaps oil and some EM currencies beset by debt-sustainability issues.”
Most risk assets should trade higher in the second quarter of the year, Normand said. He recommends that investors average into oversold markets, particularly those where central banks are buying directly. (Averaging into markets entails spreading out the purchases over time rather than diving in in one go.)
Not everyone sees the bottom as necessarily in.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s David Kostin reiterated in a note Friday that he expects the market to turn lower in coming weeks. He cited a checklist for a sustained rally similar to Normand’s -- of slowing viral spread, evidence that fiscal and monetary policy stimulus is working, and a bottoming in investor positioning and flows.
Gavekal Research Ltd.’s Anatole Kaletsky said in a note Monday that it’s too early to buy equities, citing reasons including “surprisingly complacent” investor sentiment and historical data showing bear markets almost never end on a single massive sell-off without retesting the bottom."

~ Consider structured products for Singapore bank shares: UBS
~ “We are quite near the bottom in Asian equities”: DBS’s Hou
The rout in Asian equity markets this year has not been for the faint-hearted. Yet, investment experts at private banks say it’s time for clients to indulge in a bit of bargain hunting.
Wealth managers such as UBS Group AG and DBS Group Holdings Ltd. are recommending clients dip their toes in structured products based on regional stocks, while Bank of Singapore Ltd. has upgraded Asia ex-Japan equities. Concerns about the health crisis’ economic repercussions have wiped out $5.5 trillion in Asian stock-market value since Jan. 20 when traders began reacting to virus fears. The region’s benchmark index, which snapped a four-day advance to fall 1.8% as of 11:35 a.m. in Singapore, is set for its worst quarter since 2008, led by energy shares.
While the past week’s rebound has failed to convince most investors that the market has hit a bottom, private banks are not sitting idle. Here’s what investment chiefs are recommending to clients.
UBS
“Look for oversold names,” Kelvin Tay, the Asia Pacific chief investment officer for UBS’s wealth-management unit, wrote in a note Wednesday. Historically low valuations for regional stocks excluding Japan are offering opportunities in companies related to online consumption, such as gaming, e-commerce and food delivery, he added. The Swiss bank is also recommending China property shares listed in Hong Kong, Japanese automation and machinery companies and 5G-related firms.
In an interview earlier this month, Tay said investors can consider structured products such as equity-linked notes and reverse convertible notes on Singapore bank stocks for lower “entry points.” “You are talking about banks yielding 6% and a tier-1 capital ratio of about 15% -- you can’t get it anywhere else in the world,” he said.
DBS
“We are quite near the bottom in Asian equities,” said Hou Wey Fook, DBS Bank’s chief investment officer, pointing to valuation indicators trading near historical lows, implied volatility levels, and “playbooks from SARS” and the global financial crisis. Within the region’s equities, the Singapore-headquartered bank favors China shares.
Clients have been investing in beaten-down Singapore real estate investment trusts and health-care stocks by purchasing securities or structured products enhancing yields, added Joseph Poon, group head of DBS Private Bank. He said there’s been an up-tick in clients’ trading volume this year.
HSBC
According to Patrick Ho, HSBC Private Banking’s chief market strategist for North Asia, investors still need to manage the “very weak economic and profit data of the coming weeks and months.” But in the meantime, the private bank is recommending companies with “above average” profitability, strong balance sheets, the ability to pay stable dividends and strong brand presence.
Ho said he has identified such firms in the consumer, technology and telecommunication sectors in Asia as well as China’s real estate."

~ “Numbers in the coming weeks will show just how hard the housing market was hit, but I am optimistic that the upcoming stimulus package will lessen the economic damage and we may get a V-shaped robust recovery later in the year,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist.
Homebuyer demand was strengthening markedly just before COVID-19 began its spread across the U.S.
Pending home sales, which measure signed contracts on existing homes, rose a stronger than expected 2.4% in February compared with January. Sales were up a steep 9.4% annually, according to the National Association of Realtors. That is the highest pace in exactly three years.
“February’s pending sales figures show the housing market had been very healthy prior to the coronavirus-induced shutdown,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist. “Numbers in the coming weeks will show just how hard the housing market was hit, but I am optimistic that the upcoming stimulus package will lessen the economic damage and we may get a V-shaped robust recovery later in the year.”
Regionally, pending home sales in the Northeast rose 2.8% for the month and were 5.9% higher than a year ago. In the Midwest, they increased 4.5% monthly and 14.9% annually.
Pending home sales in the South were up just 0.1% monthly, but 7.1% annually. In the West, where home prices are highest, sales grew 4.6% for the month and jumped 10.8% from a year ago.
The spring housing market was set up to be one of the best since the last recession. Closed sales of existing homes in February jumped 7% annually to the highest level since February 2007, according to the National Association of Realtors. Those closings were based on deals made in December and January. Signed contracts to buy newly built homes also soared in February, up 14% annually.
While it is impossible to know exact numbers, one estimate is that home sales this spring will drop 35% annually, according to Capital Economics. The market was already struggling with record low inventory, and now some sellers are de-listing their properties. They either don’t want people touring their homes or don’t wan to sell into a down market."

~ Officials consider aid for mortgage markets, travel industry
~ Pelosi says states and local governments will need more help
The White House and congressional Democrats are preparing for a fourth round of economic stimulus to get the U.S. through its coronavirus outbreak, even while they’re still arguing over the $2 trillion measure President Donald Trump signed Friday.
White House officials have compiled lists of requests from government agencies totaling roughly $600 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The proposals include more state aid as well as financial assistance for mortage markets and the travel industries.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters on Monday that Democrats are “collecting information, taking inventory” on what might be needed in another round of stimulus. She also indicated states and local governments need more federal assistance, and said there could be further direct payments to everyday Americans.
And in an interview with the New York Times published on Monday, she indicated that another possible move was getting rid of the limit on state and local tax deductions, or SALT, that was part of the 2017 tax overhaul and affects California, Pelosi’s home state, and New York.
But a spokesman for Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, dismissed the idea as “a nonstarter.”
“Millionaires don’t need a new tax break as the federal government spends trillions of dollars to fight a pandemic.” said the spokesman, Michael Zona.
The U.S. outbreak isn’t expected to peak for another two weeks, according to projections by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, and the president has urged Americans to continue “social distancing” practices that have devastated the economy until May.
Trump said early Monday that he’s considering hazard pay for health care professionals in a subsequent bill. He said Sunday that he’s assigned the Treasury and Labor secretaries to work on restoring a tax break for corporate restaurant spending that was repealed as part of his 2017 tax overhaul. Such a change stands to benefit the president’s company, the Trump Organization, which rents space to restaurants at many of its resort properties.
Many of the priorities Pelosi outlined for a fourth round on Monday were part of an alternative stimulus bill House Democrats proposed last week, but were rejected by Senate leaders in negotiations with Trump’s administration.

~ Larry Fink, CEO of the world’s biggest asset manager BlackRock, told shareholders that the economy will recover from the coronavirus pandemic, and when it does, there will be “tremendous opportunities” to be had.
~ “In my 44 years in finance, I have never experienced anything like this,” FInk said in an annual letter to shareholders, citing the mounting cost of the virus to human life, markets and businesses small and large.

Larry Fink, CEO of the world’s biggest asset manager BlackRock, told shareholders that the economy will recover from the coronavirus pandemic, and when it does, there will be “tremendous opportunities” to be had.
“In my 44 years in finance, I have never experienced anything like this,” Fink said in an annual letter to shareholders, citing the mounting toll of the virus to human life, markets and businesses small and large.
“As dramatic as this has been, I do believe that the economy will recover steadily, in part because this situation lacks some of the obstacles to recovery of a typical financial crisis,” Fink said. “Central banks are moving quickly to address problems in credit markets, and governments are now acting aggressively to enact fiscal stimulus.”
Late last week, President Trump signed a historic $2 trillion stimulus bill to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic. The law expands unemployment benefits, sends $1,200 checks to individuals, offers loans to small businesses and includes a $500 billion Fed program to prop up corporations. The move follows a series of actions from the Federal Reserve to stabilize the financial markets that companies and lenders rely on.
“At BlackRock, we take a long-term view of markets, and we take a long-term view in the way we run our company,” he said. “The world will get through this crisis. The economy will recover. And for those investors who keep their eyes not on the shaky ground at our feet, but on the horizon ahead, there are tremendous opportunities to be had in today’s markets.″
BlackRock manages $7.4 trillion for clients around the world and has the industry’s biggest ETF franchise. The furious decline in stock markets this month have created an opportunity for some clients to move more into equities, Fink said. He cautioned that it is “impossible” to know if markets have bottomed and that heavily indebted companies will struggle in the weeks ahead.
“For some clients, the recent sell-off created an attractive opportunity to rebalance into equities,” Fink said. “Indeed, many of our clients – even those who generally have a heavy allocation to fixed income due to their risk profiles – are looking to increase their equity allocation in this market.”

Firstly, we have the traditional window-dressing activities, which tends to see some sort of buying interest among fundamentally beaten down stocks. This happens among stocks which are widely held by institutional shareholders and are significantly lower in value than the start of the year and hence some sort of buying momentum could help fund managers to make their year-to-date performance “much better” and reflect the index’s performance.More good news is covid19 is at ending stage.
Second, we are in the midst of the Q1 reporting season , all companies, especially with the December year-end, would report their bottom line numbers in terms of their performance. While Q1 earnings could dictate market’s reaction, i.e. if the reported profits are either above or below estimate, what typically happens at the end of the Q1 period is the change in broking firm’s valuation matrix.
Analysts would roll-over their fair values of the stocks under their coverage based on the coming months earnings expectations, i.e. next year’s full year earnings forecast will now come into play instead of the 2020 performance. This typically lifts market’s perception on value as companies that are valued based on one-year forward earnings are likely to be more attractive than current year’s earnings, on the assumption that growth trajectory is still intact or improving.
Third, as we usher in the year 2020, somewhere between JUN effect will come into the picture as investors will start to nimble and re-adjust their portfolio for next year’s market’s theme as well as re-positioning on stocks where some fund managers could have locked-in their gains based on this year’s individual stock’s performance.
Fourth, although this is not a typical strategy but markets tend to have a positive momentum going into the 2021, which is celebrated as early as Jan next year, and not more than three weeks into the trading cycle of the Gregorian New Year.
Hence, with four positive catalysts helping sentiment, perhaps it’s an opportune time to look at the potential beneficiaries of this momentum.

KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia’s cash-strapped airlines could get up to RM10 billion financial assistance from Khazanah Nasional Bhd.
Sources said the potential RM10 billion would specifically be in the form of loans guaranteed by Khazanah to help the local carriers cope with the Covid-19 pandemic.
This was meant as a short-term relief for them to cover operating cost and improve liquidity, a source told the New Straits Times.
The pandemic has exacerbated the local carriers’ yields and profitability, which had already been compressed by overcapacity and irrational levels of competition particularly in Asia Pacific.
“The assistance depends on how long the Covid-19 crisis will last. Most airlines have cash reserves less than a month to keep their operations, except AirAsia Group,” the source said.
He said the government’s intervention via the sovereign wealth fund would be critical at this juncture to assist local airlines such as Malaysia Airlines Bhd, AirAsia, Firefly and Malindo Air as the air transport industry supported about 450,000 jobs in Malaysia in 2018.
“The short-term relief is important for local airlines to continue operations and keep their staff employed amid capacity reduction in certain affected routes, aircraft grounding and travel restrictions enacted to curb the spread of the virus,” the source added.
Khazanah managing director Datuk Shahril Ridza Ridzuan said he could not comment on the possible financial aid.
“Apologies but things are too fluid right now,” he said when contacted.
Malaysian carriers recently initiated a voluntary unpaid leave scheme and at least 10 per cent reduction of its senior management salary including their allowances following their reduced operations due to the pandemic.
Malaysia Airlines group chief executive officer Captain Izham Ismail confirmed that the national carrier had been in discussions with the government on emergency measures to help it sustain operation.
He said the discussions did not involve on mergers between Malaysia Airlines and AirAsia Group.
“Solutions to address the industry oversupply situation and long-term sustainability need to be addressed holistically.
“While mergers between airlines is one option, addressing the issues via regulations and policies should also not be ignored as it could just be as effective,” he said.
Izham added that any merger proposal would need to take into account anti-competition regulations, and address the numerous implementation or integration challenges including the people aspects, and respective commitments/liabilities of both airline groups.
Sobie Aviation consultant and Singapore-based independent analyst Brendan Sobie said the Covid-19 crisis presented a rare opportunity for the Malaysian airlines industry to benefit from a reset.
“However, securing government support is a critical first step if the industry is to weather this crisis and transform,” he told the NST.
Sobie pointed out that government support was needed globally and not just in Malaysia, adding that some countries had committed to supportint their aviation sector.
“This is not about the survival of the fittest airlines but about which governments will follow the likes of the US and Singapore in supporting their airlines,” he added.
Sobie said there were lots of potential components in a government support package including job support schemes, loans or loan guarantees, and reduced or waived taxes, charges and fees.
“Ideally a package in Malaysia would include all these components, resulting in a lower cost base, ensuring sufficient liquidity and avoiding layoffs.
“By maintaining jobs at pre-crisis levels, airlines will be able to restore capacity as soon as the crisis is over and resume growth,” he said adding that this would drive an overall economic recovery and ensuring Kuala Lumpur’s role as an air hub is not diminished,” he added."

“I’m not yet confident in advocating overweight risk assets positions because you’re vulnerable in that scenario to a deterioration of the news on the medical front,” said Hugh Gimber, a global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, in a phone interview. “The policy measures have helped but they’re not on their own enough for us to call a definitive bottom in this market.”While global equities rallied last week and on Monday amid optimism that fiscal and monetary support measures can limit the fallout from the pandemic, the situation around the virus remains critical and companies are continuing to slash their earnings outlooks. The full extent of damage to corporate profits remains unknown, making it dangerous to turn risk-on, Gimber said.The strategist at the $1.9 trillion asset manager is closely monitoring the strength of the labor market in the U.S. and Europe for signs of how quickly the economies will be able to rebound once lockdown measures are lifted. This data can provide a signal to resume buying equities, he said.During these challenging times, Gimber recommends focusing on quality companies with strong balance sheets and low leverage both in stocks and bonds.
“You want to be investing in companies that have the balance sheet flexibility to be able to handle this short-term hit to activity and come out on the other side the strongest,” he said.
In the bond market, he favors government debt with shorter duration over debt with a longer-term maturity as he sees the gains there as more limited. He’s particularly keen on investment-grade bonds that benefit from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s and other central banks’ purchases and support measures.
He’s much more cautious on high-yield debt issued by companies with weaker balance sheets. “The central banks will help solve the liquidity challenge for corporates, but they can’t help to solve the solvency issue for those more under-pressure names,” Gimber said.
Still, the current level of high-yield bond spreads offers a good entry opportunity for those looking to invest for one or two years because in the short-term, volatility can be significant, he said.
U.S. equities advanced on Tuesday after economic data topped estimates and 10-year Treasuries climbed. Still, coronavirus remained at the top of investors’ minds as Spain suffered its deadliest day of the pandemic, and European governments doubled down on efforts to maintain rigid lockdowns."

BRUSSELS: A pet cat has been infected with the Covid-19 coronavirus in Belgium after being contaminated by its owner, Belgian health authorities said on Friday.
Cases of contamination of pets are rare and authorities ruled out any risk of contamination to humans from home animals.
The report follows similar cases in Hong Kong where two dogs tested positive for Covid-19 during a screening campaign carried out on 17 dogs and eight cats living in contact with people carrying the virus.
In Belgium, the discovery was made by researchers at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in Liege.
This is “an isolated case” which can occur after “close contact between animals and infected humans“, said Doctor Emmanuel Andre, a government agency spokesman on the pandemic.
The virus can be transmitted from humans to animals but “there is no reason to think that animals can be vectors of the epidemic in our society“, he said.
In Hong Kong, “the dogs showed no symptoms“, while in Belgium “the cat was suffering from transitory respiratory and digestive problems“, said the Belgian food safety agency AFSCA in a statement.
“So far, there is no evidence that a domestic animal can transmit the virus to humans or other pets“, the public authority said.
As a precautionary measure, it is “strongly recommended” to apply standard rules of hygiene when dealing with pets: “avoid close contact with pets... wash your hands after handling any animal, do not let the animal lick your face.”
The aim is to prevent the transmission of the virus to the animal and to prevent the animal itself from becoming a carrier of the virus."

reported no locally transmitted coronavirus infections for the previous day and a small reduction in new cases involving travellers from overseas, as new restrictions on the entry of foreigners kicked in.
Effective Saturday, China has temporarily suspended the entry of foreign nationals with valid Chinese visas and residence permits.
The new restriction reflects worries in Beijing over the risk posed by so-called imported cases of the virus after widespread lockdowns within China helped to bring domestic transmissions under control.
Beijing has also ordered airlines to sharply cut international flights from Sunday.
A commentary in the People's Daily newspaper on Saturday reflected the concern.
""At this time, we must be extremely vigilant and cautious, and we must prevent the post-epidemic relaxation from coming too soon, leading to the loss of all our achievements,"" it said.
China's National Health Commission said on Saturday that 54 new coronavirus cases were reported on the mainland on Friday, all involving imported cases. There were 55 new cases a day earlier, one of which was transmitted locally.
The total number of infections for mainland China now stands at 81,394, with the death toll rising by three to 3,295, the commission said.
Hubei province reported no new cases, and three new deaths.
The province of 60 million, where the virus was first detected, has recorded 67,801 coronavirus cases and 3,177 deaths.
Chinese President Xi Jinping told US President Donald Trump on Friday that China would support US efforts to fight the coronavirus.
The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States rose by at least 16,000 on Friday to nearly 102,000, the most of any country."

Doctors and nurses on the front lines of the US coronavirus crisis pleaded yesterday for more protective gear and equipment to treat waves of patients expected to overwhelm hospitals as the number of known US infections surpassed 100,000, with more than 1,600 dead.
Physicians have called particular attention to a desperate need for additional ventilators, machines that help patients breathe and are widely needed for those suffering from Covid-19, the respiratory ailment caused by the highly contagious novel coronavirus.
Hospitals in New York City, New Orleans, Detroit and other virus hot spots also have sounded the alarm about scarcities of drugs, medical supplies and trained staff while the number of confirmed US cases rose by 15,000 yesterday to just over 100,000.
That was down slightly from more than 16,000 new cases reported on Thursday, the largest one-day US surge to date, but kept the United States as the world leader in the number of known infections, having surpassed China and Italy on Thursday.
“We are scared,” said Dr Arabia Mollette of Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Centre in Brooklyn. “We’re trying to fight for everyone else’s life, but we also fight for our lives as well, because we’re also at the highest risk of exposure.”
The United States ranked sixth in death toll among the hardest hit countries, with at least 1,605 lives lost as of Thursday evening, marking the first time the country had recorded more than 300 deaths in a single day, according to a Reuters tally of official data. Worldwide, confirmed cases rose above 576,000 with 26,455 deaths, the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Centre reported.
Even as hospital patient numbers steadily climbed, shortages of key medical supplies abounded.
One emergency room doctor in Michigan, an emerging epicentre of the pandemic, said he was using one paper face mask for an entire shift due to a shortage and that hospitals in the Detroit area would soon run out of ventilators.
“We have hospital systems here in the Detroit area in Michigan who are getting to the end of their supply of ventilators and have to start telling families that they can’t save their loved ones because they don’t have enough equipment,” the physician, Dr Rob Davidson, said in a video posted on Twitter.
Emergency powers
US President Donald Trump yesterday invoked emergency powers to require General Motors Co to start building ventilators after he accused the largest US automaker of “wasting time” during negotiations.
He had previously resisted mounting calls for him to invoke the Defence Production Act, a Korean War-era statute that gives the president broad procurement powers in national emergencies, seeking to exert pressure on manufacturers to act voluntarily.
Sophia Thomas, a nurse practitioner at DePaul Community Health Centre in New Orleans, where Mardi Gras celebrations late last month fuelled a local outbreak in Louisiana’s largest city, said the numbers of coronavirus patients “have been staggering.”
“We are truly a hotbed of Covid-19 here in New Orleans,” she said, adding that her hospital was trying to cope in part by shifting some patients to “telehealth” services that allow them to be evaluated from home.
New York-area doctors say they have had to recycle some protective gear, or resort to the black market.
Dr Alexander Salerno of Salerno Medical Associates, a general medical practice with offices in northern New Jersey, described going through a “broker” to pay US$17,000 (RM73,572.60) for masks and other protective equipment that should have cost about US$2,500, and picking them up at an abandoned warehouse.
“You don’t get any names. You get just phone numbers to text,” Salerno said. “And so you agree to a term. You wire the money to a bank account. They give you a time and an address to come to.”
Nurses at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York said they were locking away or hiding N-95 respirator masks, surgical masks and other supplies that are prone to pilfering if left unattended.
“Masks disappear,” nurse Diana Torres said. “We hide it all in drawers in front of the nurses’ station.”"

After days of wrangling, the US Congress passed a US$2.2 trillion relief package yesterday, sending the bill to Trump, who promptly signed it into law.
In addition to aiding hospitals, the package will send cash to businesses and unemployed workers suffering from the effects of stay-at-home orders that have had the side effect of strangling the economy.
A number of hotels in New York City, including the famed Plaza Hotel, the St. Regis and the Four Seasons, are making rooms available to medical workers fearful of carrying the virus home to their families after work, or to non-critical care patients, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said.
Marney Gruber, an emergency doctor who works in multiple hospitals around New York City, said commonly used medications were in short supply and hospitals were running out of oxygen tanks.
“These are staples in emergency medicine and ICUs — these are your bread and butter, truly, your very basic essentials,” Gruber said.
At least two New York medical schools, New York University and Columbia, have said they will graduate their fourth-year students early so they can begin treating patients with the coronavirus right away.
In the nation’s second-largest city, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said cases were spiking, putting the Southern California region on track to match New York City’s infection figures in the next five days.
The mayor spoke as he and California’s governor, who ordered all coronavirus-related evictions banned through May 31, toured a newly arrived naval hospital ship equipped with 1,000 patient beds at the Port of Los Angeles. Its sister vessel is to be deployed to New York Harbor in the near future.
At the Riverside County Fairground east of Los Angeles, California National Guard troops were setting up a 125-bed medical station to serve residents of the Coachella Valley, an area teeming with elderly retirees considered especially vulnerable to Covid-19.
The US military also is setting up field hospitals in Seattle and New York, the Pentagon said."

She said that might happen if such individuals are exposed to risk, such as having close contact with a Covid-19 patient.
""In this situation, the person may get infected. ... if you tested negative once, (this) does not mean you will remain negative in the future, ” she said during the Ministry’s Facebook live-stream on ‘Kenali Covid-19’ (Get to know COVID-19) Friday (April 3).
The live-stream, which also included the Ministry’s medical specialist Dr Aizuniza Abdullah, was aimed at answering questions on Covid-19 posted by the public.
Elaborating, Dr Zienna said it was therefore important for people to adopt preventive measures such as washing their hands, social distancing, and staying at home to contain the spread of the outbreak.
Meanwhile, on claims that vitamin C could prevent Covid-19, Dr Zienna said so far no studies have proven it.
""Generally, vitamin C can be taken as a supplement but not to prevent Covid-19. No studies have suggested it, ” she said."

There are many battles to be won in the Covid-19 pandemic. The first one is the information war — to make Malaysians understand why it is necessary to put the Malaysian economy and society in a lockdown to halt the spread of Covid-19 by breaking the chain of transmission of the virus.
It is worth noting that Nepal imposed a full lockdown on March 24 when it had a second case of Covid-19. Eleven days later on April 3, it has six confirmed cases but no death."

We must boost the Covid-19 testing facilities to track down people with symptoms, identify their contacts and quarantine them until they are no longer infectious, as well as ramping up the number of ventilators and hospital beds.
South Korea had been among the most aggressive when it comes to testing. The country prioritised identifying and isolating people testing positive for the disease, and developed capacity to run about 15,000 diagnostic tests a day. It has conducted more than 300,000 tests to date, free of charge, including in drive-through testing booths since replicated elsewhere."

Covid-19 mass testing becomes a vital post-movement control order (MCO) strategy to revive the Malaysian economic engine.
The third war is for Malaysia to survive and win the post-MCO coronavirus pandemic economics.
In Germany, Covid-19 pandemic economics will see almost half a million companies in Germany sending their staff on short-term working schemes — known as “Kurzarbeit” — to trim their payroll costs with immediate effect.
Short-term working worked well as a tool to prevent massive layoffs during the last financial crisis in 2008. It sends people home or slashes their hours substantially, but keeps them officially employed with the state funding around two-thirds of their salary."

“A wise man adapts himself to circumstances, as water shapes itself to the vessel that contains it.”
I started sharing in i3investor from the knowledge I have acquired through some of the super investors in US and a couple from locally.

Many people in i3investors asked me if their stocks met those criteria, and I have taken the time and trouble to find out through the financial statements and answered them accordingly based on quantitative analysis. I still remembered many of those stocks which I suggested meeting the criteria jumped in prices. Those were the good times and I think I have sowed some goodwill in i3investor."

Don’t be someone who turns people off
The big takeaway here is that if you want to be the person who is successful, who everyone wants to hire, you need to build habits of integrity.
There are a handful of ways to that:
• Fulfill your promises
• Be honest
• Be trustworthy
• Give credit where credit is due
• Be mindful and emotionally intuitive
• Manifest humility
• Be willing to admit you’re wrong
• Offer help when it’s needed
• Treat others with respect
• Be charitable

Not limited to just being hired (although that's something critical too) but in all other aspects of life too. Without being of ""the right character"", which definitely includes integrity, one will face various friction and negative events in his life.

“This is an unprecedented budget for extraordinary times,” Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat told parliament on Monday, just over a week after the city-state unveiled more than $30 billion in new support measures as it braces for its worst recession.
On Friday, Singapore said it will close schools and most workplaces for a month as part of stricter measures to curb a recent jump in coronavirus infections. Singapore has reported a total of 1,309 infections and six deaths from the coronavirus.
Heng said the new measures unveiled in the third budget will increase the total spending on coronavirus relief to S$59.9 bln or 12% of gross domestic product (GDP). He said Singapore will draw an additional S$4 billion from its past reserves to fund the new measures.
“The situation remains highly fluid and uncertain. The government stands ready to provide further support should it become necessary,” Heng said.
Heng said Singapore’s overall budget deficit for financial year 2020 is expected to increase to S$44.3 billion, or 8.9% of GDP."

SINGAPORE: Record low interest rates are tempting some retail investors in Singapore to load up on debt to buy shares, just as the coronavirus outbreak creates the most volatile markets since the global financial crisis.
Earlier this year, 31-year-old insurance agent Heng Kai Sheng got advances on three separate credit cards to the tune of S$150,000 (US$105,000).
With the money, he opened a share-financing account at a local bank and pledged the lot as collateral.
He was granted leverage of around 3.5 times, a S$500,000 kitty Heng’s plowing into the stock market.
“As Asians, our parents always tell us ‘don’t borrow money, repay your mortgage as soon as possible’, ” said Heng, whose initial S$170,000 share portfolio now totals about S$135,000. “But money is so cheap.”
According to preliminary data from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, bank financing for stock purchases by retail investors rebounded in February after three consecutive months of declines.
Individuals pumped around S$2bil into equities in March, 50% more than the previous month, Singapore Exchange Ltd data showed.
The increase comes as the nation’s benchmark equity gauge registered its worst quarter since the global financial crisis. The SPDR Straits Times Index ETF, the largest Singapore-listed exchange-traded fund tracking the city-state’s stocks, saw net inflows of about S$247mil in the three months ended March 31, its largest quarterly boost since 2002, Bloomberg-compiled data showed.
“There are probably new and existing investors who aren’t leveraged who would definitely want to take advantage of the sell-off to buy shares, ” said Joel Ng, an analyst at KGI Securities (Singapore) Pte.
There are also some suggestions retail investors may be using their homes as collateral to borrow money.
David Gerald, founder of investor lobby group Securities Investors Association (Singapore), said he was aware that investors “may want to refinance their housing loans” in the low-rate environment to free up cash for equity investments. However, “investors should be cautious not to over-leverage” in volatile markets because they may face margin calls, he added.
Not everyone is joining the party. While share financing by banks rose in February, the amount decreased 11% when compared to a year ago. And according to Ng, margin calls “really intensified” in March, particularly for private-bank clients who were sold leveraged products or who took on debt to buy real-estate investment trusts.
Heng said he had a three- to-five-year horizon for his investments, and maintains he’s doing the math to make sure he can always cover the interest, which ranges from 1.38% to 2.03% on the credit cards.
Some of the shares he bought include Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp, which slumped 21% last quarter, Singapore Telecommunications Ltd, down 25%, and Mapletree Industrial Trust, which declined 6.5%.
Heng knows he’s taking a risk but he’s not too worried.
“For young people like us, even if you fail, you can make up the capital, ” he said. “If you have sufficient earning power, you should take a bit more risk.”"

The paper ‘Facemasks and similar barriers to prevent respiratory illness such as Covid-19: A rapid systematic review’ has published at the pre-print repository MedRxiv yesterday and has not yet been peer-reviewed. In the review, a group of researchers based at the University of East Anglia, UK, systematically searched and analysed studies that looked at the effectiveness of facemasks. They searched for studies on whether such masks could prevent the spread of influenza-like illnesses and other respiratory symptoms in community settings, as opposed to medical settings such as clinics and hospitals. Overall, they found 31 studies that meet the criteria of inclusion in their analysis, including 12 randomised control trials (RCTs). In most cases where the information is available, these studies had used medical-grade paper surgical masks. Of the 31 studies, three RCTs found that the masks reduced the odds of developing influenza-like illnesses and respiratory symptoms by only six percent."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=140","Apr 7, 2020 2:59 PM","MoneyMaker168","Meanwhile, in the observational studies, they found that the odds of spreading respiratory diseases is reduced by 19 percent if both the infected person and their housemates wore a face mask. The effect is ‘very small’ if only the infected person or their healthy housemates wore the masks.
In studies on Hajj pilgrimages, the evidence on the protective effect of facemasks is inconsistent. However, the researchers criticised that the quality of the available studies was poor, and that the RCTs would underestimate the protective value of facemasks while the observational studies would exaggerate it. “The evidence is not sufficiently strong to support widespread use of facemasks as a protective measure against Covid-19. “However, there is enough evidence to support the use of facemasks for short periods of time by particularly vulnerable individuals when in transient higher-risk situations,” the group said, while advocating higher quality studies on the subject. Other scientists not involved in the review praised the new paper as timely and backed its findings.
“This research, while not yet peer-reviewed by scientists, is a reasonable review of previous studies and presents the existing evidence fairly – which is that there is only very limited evidence of the benefits of wearing face masks by the general public, no evidence that wearing them in crowded places helps at all, and no evidence at all yet related to Covid-19,” said University of Reading cellular microbiology Simon Clarke to the UK non-profit group Science Media Centre. University of London biological anthropologist Jennifer Cole told the SMC that the study supports prioritising limited stocks of face masks for healthcare workers, as well as others in ‘high-risk settings’ such as supermarket checkout staff and public transport operators."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=140","Apr 7, 2020 3:00 PM","MoneyMaker168","“This study, therefore, supports the importance of prioritising limited stocks for healthcare staff and other key workers in the high-risk settings identified by the study as more likely to benefit from mask use. “It is important to synthesize what we know right now, and even though these studies largely do not relate to the current outbreak, it is the best knowledge available at present,” she said. University of Southampton senior research fellow in global health Michael Head told the SMC that the review shows that there are special circumstances where masks are useful, such as when moving around people with weaker immune systems and others who are more vulnerable to disease. “There was also evidence of a potential small protective effect when facemasks were worn in community settings where the contact was quite brief such as in shops.
“However, these protective effects appear to be very small, and the studies reviewed typically contained significant biases (for example, when reporting user compliance). “Thus, despite this excellent review, there are still uncertainties around future policies that consider facemasks,” he said. Currently, the World Health Organisation’s official guidelines state that members of the public should only wear facemasks only if they are sick, or if they are caring for the ill. Those who do wear a mask must know how to use and dispose of it properly, it said, and to use it in combination with frequent handwashing."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=140","Apr 7, 2020 3:02 PM","MoneyMaker168","On Saturday, however, WHO's top emergencies expert Dr Mike Ryan suggested that using improvised ‘mouth coverings’ by members of the public is “not a bad idea”. ""So we can certainly see circumstances in which the use of masks, both homemade or cloth masks, at the community level may help in an overall comprehensive response to this disease,"" he said. However, he stressed that medical-grade masks should be prioritised for healthcare workers, and if masks are used, it should be part of a strategy that does not negate the need for handwashing and social distancing. Health Ministry director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah had said the ministry is still waiting for new guidelines from the WHO, but reiterated that those who show symptoms of illness should wear a mask.
“For the public, if you have symptoms, then, by all means, put on a mask. “The question is should everyone always wear masks but if you are exposing yourself to the public, perhaps you should, but again we need to look into evidence first,” he told a press conference on Sunday."

This results in very low chance of contracting covid to other people. Now imagine i do not wear face masks (like the majority of the US population), look what happened.

Face mask covers 2 out of 3. So technically, you're 66% safer than not wearing a face mask.
Plus don't forget, people whether they realize it or not, people tend to consciously or unconsciously touch their face especially their rubbing their eyes, nose and mouth. If not mistaken, the best way to prevent infection now is by washing your hands for 20 secs or use alcohol hand sanitizers. Face mask prevents you from ""accidentally"" touching your mouth and nose without first sanitizing or washing your hands. So, another 2 out of 3.
Another point, a more important point, it takes a few days before a person shows symptoms. From the date of actual infection to the date where the symptoms first appear, how many unnecessary people will get infected?
So bottom line, it's better to be safe than sorry. So people, wear your mask!

Then you have another saying it is is not uselul and only the sick should use it .
So for the five days a person with Covid 19 does not know they have it and spread it exponentially to many hundreds and especially close to them . Now lets say your family members get admitted to ICU and die and you are responsible all because you are not wearing one or a family friend you told no need to wear one gave it to them . You would regret telling everyone the verdict is not in so no need to wear a mask .
Its not rocket science that everyone going into public should wear a mask when the verdict is confusing . For me as a Medical Professor I would not like to be responsible for such catastrophic loss of life if I was wrong about only the sick should wear a mask but tell everyone why take a chance and all should wear a mask . After all it is so cheap and easy to make one if you dont already have one .
Be sensible and just wear a cloth mask or if you lucky to have previous stocks of surgical or N95 just wear it and dont argue so that you wont regret causing the death of many innocent lives especially that of your family .

It uses mostly, data from the Inland Revenue on income tax declared in 2019 to determine eligibility as that was the last income tax data available to the authorities. As such, there will be:
1. Those who are paid more that RM 8000 per month in 2018 but lost their jobs in 2019 who would miss out on BPN payment. There must be a way to allow these group of people to apply for BPN post-MCO, with the appropriate documentations.
2. Those who earned less than RM 8000 per month in 2018 but have earned more than that since then. They could be eligible for BPN.
3. There are business owners who would declare low salaries from companies that they own but have higher actual earnings due to majority of expenses being tagged as cost of doing business and additional income through dividends (dividends are not taxed at individual level), they may be found eligible in the system for BPN.
4. Those who under-declare their income could also be eligible for BPN. In the case of Mahfuz and Fuziah, we have to ask them how did they file their income tax in 2019 when they earn RM 24,880 per month and RM 16,000 per month, for Mahfuz and Fuziah respectively, that in the record of IRB they are earning less than RM 8000 per month.
The government should consider sharpening the accuracy of its selection by taking data from IRB, EPF and Socso."

CORONAVIRUS | Chief Secretary to the Government Mohd Zuki Ali today announced a reduction to the public service entertainment allowance as part of the civil service contribution to the Covid-19 fight. According to Zuki (photo), any savings from the allowance reduction would be channelled to the government’s Covid-19 Fund. “Public service officers in the top management group are also sensitive to the situation in the country. A meeting between the chief secretaries and heads of service on Apr 7 agreed to contribute to the Covid-19 Fund by reducing the public service entertainment allowances (ITK) for the public sector's Premier Grade (Jusa) employees. “The ITK reduction rate for main grade/special Grade B and C is five percent while it is 10 percent for main grade/special Grade A and above."

On March 27, the government also announced a RM250 billion economic stimulus package to further help the country tackle the economic and health ramification of the crisis. To date, Malaysia had recorded 4,119 positive Covid-19 cases, of which 65 patients have died and 1,487 fully recovered."

They have become almost untouchable, even in hard times, they receive bonuses on top whatever allowances they get. It is not surprising graduates would regard public sector career as a preferred choice. Removing the entire entertainment is the least they can do. For every ringgit collected almost 90% goes into sustaining a bloated civil service. This sector does not generate future wealth.

Come on Chief Secretary to the Government. You must be joking. You people are a disgrace with this 5% and 10% announcement.
Even the Sultan of Kelantan has forsaken 6 months of his emoluments. Daulat Tuanku!!
And you have the cheek to announce this meager cut after having a great meeting of Secretaries? Malaysians are suffering...some at the brink of depression and being lost what to do next.
While ordinary Malaysians grapple with what to put on the table for their family each day, you civil servants have your fat salaries banked in on the 24th of each month, thanks to TAX PAYERS.
Those in GLCs, statutory bodies and Civil Service A and Senior Grade staff should be taking a 20% cut in salaries.
CEOs of statutory bodies and all economic corridors should have their salaries cut by 50% as many CEOs are drawing RM 70k and above plus grand emoluments.
Please do not donate if you are not sincere. Your announcement smacks of insincerity. May GOD Bless You all."

At the meeting they should be clearly told that there will be no entertainment under the MCO and following the noble acts of the King and other Royals, they should sacrifice something for the nation. After all they are paid full salary even during the MCO. As Govt servants they should set exemplary actions for the rakyat. It all boils down to leadership. Whoever chaired the meeting was not dynamic enough to make the giant step of asking for more from them. If one is getting RM1000, 10% translates to RM100. Imagine out of an entertainment allowance, which is spent on dining, they can only part with 10%. What about their savings on petrol and others? Can't they part with it?
Don't expect the rakyat to congratulate and thank you for this. When you give, please give wholeheartedly and generously, not a token amount just for the sake of contributing. Meaningless.
This should also apply to all MPs, they too should contribute from their allowances."

KUALA LUMPUR: Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin will address the nation in a live telecast at 4pm today.
He is expected to announce the National Security Council’s decision on an extension to the Movement Control Order (MCO) imposed amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
The live telecast will be available on several local television networks.
Yesterday, Health Ministry director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said he will brief the Prime Minister on the latest updates on the outbreak for a decision to be made on the MCO’s extension.
The MCO, which started on March 18, is scheduled to end on April 14.

Ismail Sabri on the other hand has hinted that more stringent measures including further curtailments of movements which will likely be introduced after MCO2 extends next Tuesday.
Should Muhyiddin decides to pull the trigger again, this will the 3rd MCO imposed by the PN-led government and the 2nd time MCO is going to be extended.
MCO1 (March 18-April 1) was generally accepted by all Malaysian and most found it necessary as many parts of the world including China and parts of Europe has already experienced thousands of death casualties by then. Everyone was hoping that Muhyiddin has made a wise decision and the two weeks period of lock-down was accepted.
But a week before MCO1 was to end, Muhyiddin made a kiasu announcement and claimed that MCO1 has not delivered the expected results and, in his own words, 'out of no-choice', the country came under another two weeks of clamp-down. It was sheer disappointing indeed for the vast majority as this means there is no income for an entire month.
So if Muhyiddin were to make yet another extension, even if it is just for just another week into March 21, people will not take kindly with MCO3 as he will be seen to be making frivolous decisions.
No country in the world has so far made two consecutive extensions of lock-downs and by the look of it, Malaysia is likely going to be the first.
Each additional day the shut-down is extended, billions of ringgit in workers' income are lost. What about the losses of businesses of the industries that are gravely affected by the moratorium? Until today, i.e. on the 24th day of MCO, Muhyiddin has not even bother to inform us the losses the country is incurring each day of MCO. That speaks so much of his concern for the country."

Absolutely correct. If the criteria for selection to head a GLC is merely to have an MP status to your name, then PN is nosediving our economy to the dark ages. We need qualified and competent leaders, not just someone who is a member of a political party or even friends linked to for example MO1 pretending to clean up the debts and problems but actually cleaning up the money for themselves.
We can see not all of PH's chosen ones are competent either. Some of these incompetent people are still sitting on the boards and management, still enjoying the perks and fat cheques that come with their appointment and pushing their personal agenda onto the GLC. The discontent is finally being brought to light by PATRIOT. .
The Armed Forces Pension Fund (LTAT) is under fire from this veterans group Patriot who are complaining loudly and publicly regarding LTAT's investment Boustead Bhd starting with BHIC's freefalling share price and the overall handling responsible is by its CEO Dato Amrim. Changes are overdue. While LTAT's Chief Executive and technocrat Nik Amlizan has done a commendable job cleaning up POST-BN, however board members and political appointees Maznah Jalil and Akhram Sanusi are such huge question marks. How qualified are they to sit alongside established army generals and experienced investment managers in LTAT? How did they even get appointed there? Are they even deeper inside their subsidiaries and who are their kuncus if any? What is crystal clear is with the huge billions losses they are failing in their jobs ... Some netizens are asking when as like what the Patriot pointed out, there needs to be immediate removal of such political appointees.
Next why LTAT's Boustead Bhd seems like inow a complete worst mess. Analysts have said that it's technically bankrupt. Is that right? The new CEO Amrim has obviously failed to turn it around. Their companies have not become better butt far far worst. Really its worst financial performance losing more than RM 1.2 Billions. Worst ever in history.. Unheard of Amrim can lose so much money, almost half of 1MDB 2.6 Billion of MO1 slushy money and not get fired yet? How did he get the job? Chosen as friendly to old MO1 cronies? This is the Army Pension Fund we talking about right? The frontliners at MCO saving our lives right? And this is how we repay them? That's not the criteria set out by TS Rafidah. So they should be sacked immediately and those 50:50 should have their pays and perks reduced by 70 percent. Keep the money for the army boys not for the political cronies. Enough of this ScUMNO. Thank you TS Rafidah."

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected Malaysia’s real gross domestic product (GDP) to grow at a rate of nine percent next year, the fastest among the Asean-5 countries, which are expected to see a combined GDP growth of 7.8 percent.
Besides Malaysia, Asean-5 includes Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam, which are set to expand by 8.2 percent, 6.1 percent, 7.6 percent and seven percent, respectively.
For 2020, the Washington-based organisation forecasts Malaysia’s economy to contract 1.7 percent, as the Asean-5 GDP shrinks 0.6 percent.
The IMF’s latest 2021 projection for Malaysia is higher than Fitch Ratings’ growth forecast of 5.8 percent.
Global growth is expected to rebound to 5.8 percent in 2021, well above trend, reflecting the normalisation of economic activity from very low levels, the IMF said in a report released yesterday.
It projected a minus three percent global growth for 2020, which is largely affected by Covid-19 pandemic.
“The advanced economy group is forecast to grow at 4.5 percent, while growth for the emerging market and developing economy group is forecast at 6.6 percent,” it said.
In comparison, in 2010 global growth after the global financial crisis rebounded to 5.4 percent from -0.1 percent in 2009.
However, the rebound in 2021 depends critically on the pandemic fading in the second half of 2020, allowing containment efforts to be gradually scaled back and restoring consumer and investor confidence, the IMF said.
Significant economic policy actions have already been taken across the world, focused on accommodating public health care requirements, while limiting the amplification to economic activity and the financial system.
The projected recovery assumes that these policy actions are effective in preventing widespread firm bankruptcies, extended job losses and system-wide financial strains.
Nonetheless, the level of GDP at the end of 2021 in both advanced and emerging market and developing economies is expected to remain below the pre-virus baseline.
As with the size of the downturn, there is extreme uncertainty around the strength of the recovery.
“Some aspects that underpin the rebound may not materialise, and worse global growth outcomes are possible - for example, a deeper contraction in 2020 and a shallower recovery in 2021 - depending on the pathway of the pandemic and the severity of the associated economic and financial consequences,” IMF said."

Most economist think that the global fundamental economic principles are intact - supply and demand are still present but what has disrupted global demand and causing this global economy meltdown is a medical cause and not a economic cause. Hence economist think that once the covid 19 pandemic recedes; the global spending and demand will not only normalized but increased. This IMF projection of Malaysia's GDP to grow 9pct in 2021 is based on a collective ASEAN projection hence it is flawed. Malaysia's main and pretty much only export is petroleum. Unless oil prices explode to USD 100 to 120 a barrel next year; only then can we see the projected 9% GDP Malaysian. This is unlikely to happen because even if the global economy improves beyond global expectations in 2021, the problem is there is just to many oil producers in the world today and what we hand just witnessed in March 2020 between the Russians, American and Saudi is that no one can agreed on cutting oil production to sure up demand. Secondly, for a country to truly feel the positive global economic benefits is to enter into the global supply chain network. Sadly Malaysia has long detached from this supply chain network. The only two items that Malaysia contributes to the global network is Petroleum for which we are a small player and have no leverage in controlling global prices and palm oil, a has been product soon to be replaced by synthetic palm oil. As for manufacturing, most manufacturing from Malaysia in the 80's and 90's have moved to Vietnam and China and thus Malaysia hardly makes money from Manufacturing. With the PN gov't in place in the last two months that comprises of a globally famous corrupt collation partner UMNO and a Islamist anti capitalism partner; it is very unlikely Malaysia is going to attract foreign investment. Not to mention the lackluster caliber of the current super bloated cabinet ministers and PM and his inner circle does look like the current negative GDP for 2020 is going to be managed well. Hence I think IMF may play a role in solving Malaysia's economic woes for which politicians across the political divide have failed - a bail out from the IMF and world bank. This would be a bitter pill to swallow as both these entities will drastically cut Malaysia's operating cost which will see massive gov't cuts in unnecessary glamours projects, massive reduction in civil servants post, end to preferential treatment in Malaysia business, politicians made accountable corruption and end to dumbo politics which is rampant these days."

In short. Malaysia has been too reliant on oil and not innovative enough to actually progress the nation economically
Both government and commerce has viewed Malaysians as serfs to be used and abused To feed their own selfish ends
Instead they should have been seen as assets to increase the productivity and diversification of the economy
The collapse of oil prices has exposed Malaysia to a reality which Harapan could not deal with. The pandemic will see the end of the Malaysian delusion, because there will be nothing left on which to rebuild the economy.

Former primary industries minister Teresa Kok said she is happy that her successor, Khairuddin Takiri has decided to proceed with policies related with bamboo planting, despite having criticised the idea when she mooted it last year.
“I am happy that Khairuddin Takiri is continuing the policies and direction towards bamboo planting, which was mooted by me and the Malaysian Timber Industry Board (MTIB) last year.
“I believe the new minister has realised that his statement criticising my suggestion in March 2019 was a little unwise as he did not get a clear picture of the suggestion to plant bamboo on a wider scale,” she posted on her Facebook last night.
Kok said Khairuddin might not have known that the article published by Utusan Malaysia, titled ‘Forget oil palm, plant bamboo’ that he had then referred to, was twisted out of context.
On March 3, 2019, Khairuddin had posted on his Facebook questioning Kok’s idea for the bamboo industry.
“Another ‘sensible’ idea from a minister, aside from rubber tapping during the wet season. Plant bamboo and coconuts to replace oil palm.
“They are trying to hide their failure to manage the market prices of palm oil until the prices have fallen so much by coming up with a new idea, which they think is ‘sensible’.
“Is it that easy for ministers to throw ideas out?” Khairuddin had then stated in his Facebook posting.
In her Facebook posting today, Kok also said she is willing to offer advice, opinions and suggestions on the bamboo initiative or any other matters under her former ministry.
On Feb 24, the Pakatan Harapan government collapsed after Bersatu and several PKR leaders led by Azmin Ali defected and joined hands with BN and PAS.
This new cooperation later received the support of Gabungan Parti Sarawak (GPS), enabling the parties to form a simple majority Perikatan Nasional government with Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin at the helm."

The veritable cynic in me is going against his proper instinct for a bit. I must say –cough, splutter, ugh! – that I’ve been suitably impressed with the ‘Belakang Masuk’ regime of Muhyiddin Yassin. Much to my surprise, it has not so much as handled as how the Covid-19 crisis was managed.
It was managed quite superbly. So much so, I’m stunned. I did think the regime of interlopers were out of their depth every which way. All of them. Collectively. So what happened?
What happened wasn’t Muhyiddin, really. It wasn’t anyone in the regime for that matter. Far from it. The Muhyiddin regime would’ve been running around like, as Australians like to say, headless chooks (chickens).
It was one man on whom even the Chinese Communist Party-controlled China Global TV Network (CGTN) – propaganda purveyors, of course – heaped high praise just the other day, when the infection and death rates began to stabilise and – lo and behold! – climb down.
That man is Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah, whose name gets a paragraph. As it should.
Noor Hisham was throughout the voice of calm and candour. He was measured. He was professional. He told it as he saw it. He didn’t colour Covid-19. He didn’t fudge the statistics, as Malaysia is so historically inclined to do. He didn’t blame anyone. He didn’t point the finger at China either.
Noor Hisham was entirely above politics.
Noor Hisham was so unlike Hishammuddin Hussein. Remember him? When MH370 disappeared, long after it was tracked by Malaysian air force radar ‘turning back’ over northern Malaysia and vanished into the southern depths of the Indian Ocean, Hishammuddin, who moonlighted as defence minister, turned the disaster into a political sideshow."

Needless to say, he was not. He was cagey at first. Heck, he was cagey throughout. Then his confidence grew and he played to the gallery. He must have thought this was his chance to shine, to be anointed prime minister-in-waiting after his cousin leaves the country’s money-vaults. As they say: give a politician a ‘live’ television camera and a microphone and he or she will sing Canto pop-songs long into the night.
He thought he was in full charge of the facts. And when he wasn’t, he tried to pass the buck (read microphone) to somebody else. Trouble was: none of the dimwits knew any better than Hishammuddin or Najib Razak, who, incidentally, made himself quickly scarce from the media briefings. I suppose he had lots of state institutions to allegedly liquidate and take his wife Rosmah Mansor on international shopping sprees.
Noor Hisham, conversely, was a steady-hand. He steadied the ship at a time when, if left to the interlopers of the ‘Belakang Masuk’ regime, would have gone amok with a hellfire of announcements and pronouncements that, if not utterly confusing or meant to confuse, would surely have obfuscated the situation, as dire as it was or could have been.
Noor Hisham was like his US counterpart Dr Anthony Fauci, who at times contradicted his lunatic boss Donald Trump, who – surprise, surprise – didn’t sack him like he had so many others before who’d trampled on his fat toes, a.k.a. the Trump authority.
The other person the CGTN heaped praise on was New Zealand’s health director-general Ashley Bloomfield, who worked closely with the intelligent Kiwi prime minister Jacinda Ardern"

As an aside: shame on all those politicians, anywhere in the world, but especially in Malaysia, who failed to show the moral compunction, as Ardern has, to take a 20% salary cut for six months. Or as the politicians in the state of Victoria in Australia, who gave up their pay hike for 12 months, donating it to charities. Or the prime minister Scott Morrison and his cabinet, who buried their heads in sand over taking a pay cut as the country’s unemployment rate looks set to soar beyond 10%, twice the pre-Covid-19 number.
Even the lunatic Trump didn’t give up a dime of his US$400,000 a year salary, or Mike Pence, who’s paid US$235,000 just to look pretty as Trump’s co-stagecoach rider. In fact, Trump donated US$100,000, his last quarter salary, to the severely underfunded Department of Health and Human Services but most Americans say it’s a sham. Read here for more.
Noor Hisham came across as completely trustworthy. This isn’t a word you’d use cavalierly on politicians generally but especially on Malaysian politicians in a country renowned for greed, selfishness and endless racism, corruption and kleptomania."

This is a characteristic of being trustworthy. His updates were premised not on the political or the need to “hide” facts but on facts and figures carefully culled to land a full and proper picture of the situation facing the people and become the basis for decision-making.
It’s a pity a number of Malaysian louts – uneducated idiots, generally – tried to flout the movement control order (MCO) rules. Nothing unusual, really, knowing that this is in fact part of “Malaysian culture” to test the limits of authority. Don’t throw them in jail but put them on a slow, preferably leaking, boat to China.
There’s no way Muhyiddin could have managed the crisis without Noor Hisham and the staff of hospitals, the police (for once) and the armed forces personnel who backed up the police. The good thing – and I want to say this sincerely – is that Muhyiddin let Noor Hisham take charge of the situation and manage it, and he told his interlopers in cabinet and elsewhere to back off and shut their loose traps.
That they did. But this doesn’t mean Malaysians have now profound new faith in the ‘Belakang Masuk’ regime. Once Covid-19 dies down or hibernates, as seems most likely, the Muhyiddin regime will be back to old tricks. Even the black arts.
The first shots of this idiotic nonsense of old – the Umno-isation of Pengkianat (oops: Perikatan) Nasional have been fired over the bow of Malaysians. Muhyiddin is guaranteeing cronyism will live strong and bright and forever. Every cabinet minister and his or her underling, including MPs, I gather, will be given high-paying jobs in Malaysia’s terribly state-protected, crony-infested, inefficient and uncompetitive government-linked companies (GLCs)."

That was refreshingly incisive Manjit Bhatia
But when we have to praise scheming Malay politicians only for their supreme sacrifice of staying away from the limelight (and the virus) and allowing good sense to prevail, we know what a low ebb we have reached.
And yet we've had at least one retired ambassador making a clarion call to the masses to support ""the current government, whatever its faults,"" because it "" is focused on the elephant in the room.""
While he didn't bother to list what its faults are except to acknowledge them by omission, he made much of its focus on the elephant - which is akin to praising a fireman for training his fire hose on the flames or a teacher for getting into the classroom or an MP for attending parliament.
But enough about brown nosing. The warning you put out about the potential resumption of crookedness-run-amok when the virus diminishes in its virulence is a valid one.
Just as social distancing merely pauses or slows down the spread, Covid 19 offers Malaysians a respite from the impending onslaught of bigotry in all its shades from a Malay-only government led by a Malay-first PM who was terribly discomfited by the multi-ethnic composition of the coalition he subverted."

3. Most of our politicians rise based on this system
4. Former DCA top civil servant Azharuddin Abdul Rahman known around the world for his laughable Balotelli analogy is also a product of this system
5. Noor Hisham Abdullah is a outlier to the system, not to the nation. I do not intend to put a racial spin on him but it is the elephant in the room
6. Take note that Noor Hisham Abdullah only came to prominence during recent change to the PN regime. During the PH regime, Dr Wan Azizah, Dr Dzul and Dr Lee Boon Chye were doing just fine. This does not portend well for this PN government. Post Covid 19, if the politicians recover their normal mode, Malaysia will be in more grave problems

They believed that they were firmly in political control, the Malays were backing them sole hardheartedly and they actually believed in their ""Ketuanan Mentality"" propaganda that they were dishing out thinking that UMNO were made of the greatest of minds. Malaysian press has always been regulated hence questions were vetted before being asked to ensure that ministers look like they are in control. But when Hishamuddin and gang were faced with the international media on the MH issue who were all unscripted and they were asking tough questions on the downing of the plane; the true ""Kebodohon UMNO"" nature popped out of the bag thus making Hishamuddin and his UMNO regimen look like nincompoops. Fast forward to the current Covid 19 crisis. The current PN leader PM Myhuddin in reality realizes that he is incapable of handling this national emergency and best to let DG Dr Hisham handle it. Secondly he must be aware by now that his coalition is filled with backstabbers (UMNO), imbeciles (PAS) and disloyal (Bersatu) members and his ground is shaky. Any mess up from his part on this national emergency; his own coalition partners may use this as a reason to get rid of him. He also know that in-spite of Azmin Ali & himself selling the reason for them over throwing the previously democratically elected gov't was to champion the rights of the Malay people with this PN all malay gov't, somehow he is aware that this reason is not received by most malays and most malays & non malays alike are just waiting for PN to mess up and collapse and thus not really willing to give them a chance. Lastly he knows that the caliber of his gov't and ministers are in the not to bright category. Hence he has no choice but the leave it to the DG Dr Hisham to settle this covid 19 issue and hopefully get some credit in the long run if Dr Hisham manages it well. If the Covid 19 epidemic management goes south then in the true Malaysian politician style PM Myhuddin will make Dr Hisham take the blame."

Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (KPDNHEP) Minister Alexander Nanta Linggi has made some clarifications regarding what businesses are allowed to operate in the third phase of the movement control order (MCO) as well as the application process. “Under the first and second phases of the MCO, KPDNHEP had given permission to industry players to ensure the rakyat has access to basic necessities and critical products throughout the MCO. “In order to balance the economic sustainability of the country, the government has agreed to take proactive and responsive steps to allow several additional economic sectors to operate in phases (in the third phase of the MCO),” he said in a statement today. He clarified that businesses in the food, e-trading and delivery sectors that have already received the ministry’s approval to operate in the first or second phase of the MCO do not need to reapply with KPDNHEP. However, those who have applied to the ministry before but have yet to receive their approval should reapply to the ministry again, he said. Meanwhile, there are several additional sub-sectors that are being allowed to operate under supervision by the ministry. They are hardware stores, electric and electronic stores (does not include telecommunications and ICT stores) and full-service laundromats. These sub-sectors must apply for approval to operate under the MCO, said the minister, through the International Trade and Industry Ministry’s (Miti) website. “Only complete requests which fulfill the standard operating procedures (SOPs) will be considered. Requests received from anywhere else other than the (Miti) portal will not be processed,” he added. These companies must also make sure that the location of their business is not within a red zone, yellow zone or areas under the enhanced movement control order (EMCO) as imposed by the National Security Council (NSC), he said. He stressed that these businesses will be under his ministry’s supervision and they must also obey the rules set by the NSC, the Health Ministry, the local government as well as other relevant enforcement agencies. If they are found to violate any of them, the businesses will have their approval license revoked immediately, he said. The MCO was first implemented on March 18, initially for a two-week period. It has since been extended twice, first to April 14 and then later to April 28."

Don’t they realize full-service laundromats can potentially INDIRECTLY transmit Covid-19 ?
Consider the following scenario.
It only takes ONE ASYMPTOMATIC Covid-19 infected customer to trigger off SEVERAL clusters.
Imagine a situation whereby an asymptomatic customer sends his clothes to the laundry. His clothes would surely be contaminated with the virus. The laundry worker, on seeing that the customer looks healthy, might not take precautions while handling his clothes. Wouldn’t the laundry worker be at risk of getting infected ? If she gets infected a symptomatically, she will continue to work at the laundry. Will she not be passing the virus onto other customers’ WASHED CLOTHES while she folds and packs them ? The uninfected customers, on seeing that the worker looks healthy, happily brings the clothes home and you can imagine what will happen after that.
Opening of laundry shops put the laundry workers at risk. Customers, though not in close direct contact with one another will also be at great risk. Though social distancing between customers can be maintained at the laundry shops but can we rule out the possibility of the disease spreading by INDIRECT CONTACT (through handling of contaminated unwashed clothes and handling of washed clothes by the infected laundry worker).
Furthermore, if self-service laundry shops are not allowed to open, more customers might rush to full-service laundry shops thereby increasing the probability of transmission of the disease.
MINISTERS , PLEASE USE COMMON SENSE WHEN YOU MAKE. DECISIONS DURING THIS TRYING TIME. ALL OF YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE WISER THAN THE. RAKYAT ! ! !"

You don't need to build the tallest building on earth or send a person to space to earn respect.'
China Global TV Network (CGTN) has listed Health MInistry director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah (above) as one of the world’s top three doctors ‘born’ from public health officials in handling the Covid-19 outbreak, alongside America’s Dr Anthony Fauci and New Zealand’s Dr Ashley Bloomfield.
On its website on Tuesday, CGTN said it has crowned Dr Noor Hisham as one of the top doctors in the world for his straightforward and calm approach in handling the COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia.
CGTN said that a few months ago, hardly anybody knew of Noor Hisham, 56, and the other two but they have now become the most “trustable” sources of information and facts for the pandemic in their own countries.
""Every time I see Health director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah, I feel reassured. The man has been a tower of strength for many Malaysians,"" CGTN quoted a local portal journalist as saying, adding that Noor Hisham is also a ""trusted face"" and ""a bulwark against confusion"".
According to CGTN, Fauci, 79, is the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAD) while Bloomfield, 54, is the director-general of health in New Zealand.
Meanwhile, Health Minister Dr Adham Baba congratulated Noor Hisham for earning the recognition.
Adham, in his latest Facebook posting, said: “A great appreciation and honour for the country’s medical sector when our Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah is recognised by China Global Television Network as among the world’s best three doctors in handling the Covid-19 situation.”"

We salute Health Ministry director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah for his focused daily update, done in an assuring and unassuming manner.
Even on a day when there is a surge in the number of sick cases, he is very obliging by informing viewers what has caused the surge and how and what the Health Department is doing to contain it.
He is never in the habit of making accusatory or defensive comments or overreacting or over-promising anything. He starts calmly and ends his update calmly.
Even when attacked by other private doctors, he has professionally avoided discussing those complaints during his updates. He is truly a gentleman doctor. A gift to Malaysians during this challenging time."

Of course, there would also be the odd inevitable naysayers and fault-finders.
It is quite evident that he is not given to political niceties and is focused on his responsibilities of marshalling the country’s efforts towards slaying the Covid-19 beast.
Noor Hisham has no time for sweet talk out of political considerations. He just calls the shots as he reads them.
In fact, his performance is so outstanding that Health Minister Adham Baba, aware that he pales in comparison, has wisely chosen to stay out of the limelight.
Even if this recognition is by a “local” TV network and not by an international body, we can take pride that one of ours has received such ""World Top 3"" esteem."

He has done a miserly 3.0 per thousand testing, thereby allow the stealth virus to infect and create a larger asymptomatic cluster which he makes little attempt to uncover.

People are beginning to see the truth about Noor Hisham following what looks like an orchestrated publicity campaign including paid content on image influencer websites.
He was considered untouchable and medical professionals who criticised him for not dealing with difficulties on the ground like lack of PPE were viciously attacked in the media and threatened with the sack. Now we know their claims had substance.
Everyday when he announces the new data we are increasingly disbelieving what he says. The low numbers appear to be due to low testing. He repeatedly announces new clusters - even 2 million foreigners - who have not been tested so the numbers massively understate the potential. Our numbers are so low relative to other countries that it defies belief.
Now we know from yesterday's revelations that with Dzulkifley and Lee he was involved in the decision for not banning mass gatherings before the tabligh event which is the source of so many cases and deaths.
The numbers go up the MCO is extended, the numbers go down the MCO is extended. It's most likely that he's shooting in the dark and not in control like he says. The MCO will extend under Noor Hisham, millions of people will be harmed by that and he shows no concern whatsoever... so long as he is in the limelight that's all that matters to him and his fan club.

Though, the praise from CGTN is nothing but political propaganda from the CCP.
I am still surprised that ALL politicians and the DG did not highlight or take any active actions against the two biggest risk groups. The Tabligh cluster and the migrant workers cluster. In South Korea alone, one church gathering is enough to spark a national emergency. In Singapore the highly praised ""isolate and contact trace"" has just been breached by the migrant workers. In fact, both NZ and Australia pretty much copy the Singapore model and they both now have good successes with the stringent lock down measure. Both AU/NZ does not have migrant workers issue though.
In terms of test per millions population. Malaysia is in the middle quadrant. Certainly not even close to the Australia, NZ, South Korean and Singapore. https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-19-tests-cases-scatter-with-c...
The two biggest unique risk factors for Malaysia are the Tabligh cluster and the mirgant workers clusters (of which no one really know how many they are but probably in the 2 - 3 millions people). Blindly following WHO guidelines could be a path to disaster. Many European countries were following WHO guidelines of not closing borders early and look at where they are at now. Taiwan would not be the best COVID19 managed country today if it did not contradict WHO and implement stringent border control very early.
Moral of the story. You need to look at the unique risk factors in each country and take actions accordingly. I feel Malaysia did not take appropriate actions against the two biggest risk factors which IMHO is a time bomb waiting to explode. I hope I am proven wrong ..."

Like any Form Five student, Nurul Aini Zamri is concerned about her SPM examinations. Under usual circumstances, school is a mere 10-minute walk from her home in Kampung Orang Asli Pulau Indah, Port Klang. However, with it now closed and teaching and learning moved online, Aini has found herself completely disconnected. “We don’t have a computer, we don’t have a laptop,” she told Malaysiakini when interviewed at her house recently. The Mah Meri teenager needs to pass Bahasa Malaysia and History to graduate secondary school, but slow internet speed in her village means she has not been able to download revision exercises that her teacher shares in the class’ WhatsApp group."

Her classmates, who largely ignore her because she is Orang Asli, are not helpful either. Mobile internet data on her father’s mobile phone is fast running out, but buying “top-up” is not as important as putting food on the table right now. Her parents catch and sell seafood for a living and have not been allowed to work since the movement control order (MCO) began. Food vs data Experiences like these were a common thread in Malaysiakini’s conversations with parents about e-learning. Like Aini’s parents, Suriayana Mohammad struggles to get fast-enough internet speed to download school work for her two children onto her smartphone. They live in metropolitan Kajang. “The government is giving free internet but people are all staying at home now so the speed is very slow. We have been finding it hard to download (school) activities for the kids. “We have been facing this problem in the city, but what about those in the kampung?” she wondered. For some working parents, the added responsibility of supervising home-based learning was stretching them too thin. Even with sufficient internet and devices, Nadirah R from Shah Alam struggles to divide her time between working from home, doing house chores and being a teacher to her children. “Now I need to multitask as my work hours are also their school hours. There is a clash. “The problem is when I need to cook, look after my younger children and organise the house all while I work or else my boss will get upset with me. How can I do this?” she exclaimed in a phone interview with Malaysiakini. For Puchong homemaker Jumiati Ilyas, fixed broadband is one of the many things her family has had to sacrifice to minimise expenses. This means her three school-going children will miss out on e-learning initiatives, but this is the best she can manage for now. “I understand the need for my kids to study at home during the MCO. But my husband has not been able to go out to work, so I had to do it (cut the internet). “I am more worried about being able to provide food and drink to my kids,”"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=150","Apr 20, 2020 10:50 AM","THEREALDEAL","The digital divide For many households across the country, fixed broadband is a luxury. Even in the most industrialised states in the country, data from the Communications and Multimedia Ministry showed that less than 15 percent of people had access to home internet. In less-developed states, the number was far more meagre. As of the second quarter of 2019, 14.7 percent of Putrajaya inhabitants had fixed broadband - the highest in the country. Selangor was a close second with 14.4 percent while Kuala Lumpur was third with 13.4 percent. In contrast, only 2.1 percent of Kelantan inhabitants had home internet while in Sabah it was 2.6 percent. That said, Malaysians appear to rely much more on their mobile phones for internet access. According to Q2 2019 data from the ministry, mobile broadband penetration among Kuala Lumpur inhabitants was at 246.4 percent. The trend of having several mobile internet subscriptions per person was similarly seen in Johor, Malacca, Negeri Sembilan, Perak, Penang, Sarawak and Selangor. In Sabah, however, only 78.3 percent of inhabitants had mobile broadband. Earlier this week, Education Minister Radzi Jidin said the ministry had conducted a survey on 670,000 households and 36.9 percent said they had access to no electronic devices at all. Only six percent had personal computers and even less (5.7 percent) had tablets. Smartphones were more commonplace at 46 percent."

However, in both urban and rural areas, teachers told Malaysiakini that they were facing challenges in finding a method that worked for the whole class. For one educator in a Petaling primary school, some of her students had the means for such learning but others, usually those from low-income families, struggled to access data-heavy tools like Google Classroom, Microsoft Teams or Zoom. According to Australian internet service search engine WhistleOut, a one-hour Zoom group video call at 720p needs 1.35GB of data. Therefore for families that rely on mobile internet for work and school, an extra 1GB daily from the government might not be sufficient to support daily Zoom classes. Under these circumstances, the simple messaging app WhatsApp was more feasible. Even then, some were missing out. “WhatsApp is a problem for those parents who have phones that can’t access the internet, especially full-time homemakers,” shared the teacher on condition of anonymity. Educators in rural areas were also using WhatsApp, but this was reaching only a fraction of students. An English teacher at a secondary school in Semporna, Sabah, Yong Lin Li, has been out of contact with about 40 percent of her students since the MCO began. For those she is able to reach, she designs her lessons around the many limitations they face at home."

Students have until Wednesday to submit their homework. “I don't conduct classes every day. Because let’s say if on Monday a student doesn’t have any internet and can only reload on Tuesday, they can still pick up,” she shared in an interview with Malaysiakini. Another consideration was the amount of time her students could spend on their parent’s electronic devices to complete their assignments. Due to frequent internet disruptions, Yong admitted that keeping students engaged was a challenge. “In some classes, I can get homework back from half my students. In other classes, maybe only four to five students consistently do the work,” she said. Also facing low engagement rates in her WhatsApp-based lessons was fellow TFM English teacher Julianna Rushdi, who is only in contact with half her students."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=150","Apr 20, 2020 10:51 AM","THEREALDEAL","Placed at a different Semporna secondary school that had a significant stateless student population, she observed that those who needed more attention were often the same students who struggled with e-learning most. “Definitely students from the front classes are the ones doing more work [...] if the family has a little more money, they will usually be in the front class and they can study at home. “But students in the back classes, some of their family conditions are not so good and it is very hard for them to study at home. Or they don’t have a phone and I can’t contact them,” she said. After five weeks out of the classroom, Julianna said it was becoming increasingly challenging to virtually supervise and motivate her students. “They are teenagers, so they rather use the (free) 1GB to watch Instagram, play games and watch Youtube. They waste the 1GB actually, but we can’t force them to do work for the whole day. “It is quite difficult to control this,” she shared. Step in or they fall behind Be it in rural or urban areas, households are struggling to adapt due to a lack of hardware, high-speed internet, internet data and time for home-based e-learning. In turn, these conditions are making it difficult for teachers to engage with students during the MCO, especially those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. While it is a relief that public examinations have been cancelled or postponed, news that schools could remain closed for even after the MCO is lifted has teachers concerned that even more students could slip through the cracks. Julianna hopes the Education Ministry will streamline the curriculum, teaching methods and monitoring mechanisms for home-based learning. Yong, meanwhile, wants the ministry to step in to minimise the digital divide. The Singapore government, for example, loans out laptops, tablets and internet dongles to enable needy students to participate in home-based learning. Yong suggested that hardcopy reading material could also be made available to such students. Educational television programmes on TV Okey could be supplemented with lessons broadcasted over the radio. “Or else, there will definitely be some side effects. There will be a gap between those who have access to online materials and those who don’t."

The Cheras MP said the food aid, including groceries and rice, were intended for distribution to 1,000 B40 families in his constituency.
""The sports complex was chosen as the place to keep 2,000 food packs. A thousand for Cheras and 1,000 for Bandar Tun Razak.
""Bandar Tun Razak's share of the food packs were distributed much earlier, but then the Cheras one, because I'm not a member of the ruling coalition, I was denied my share,"" Tan told Malaysiakini.

Of the 1,000 packs marked for Cheras, Tan said 250 were taken for distribution, but he was unsure of the recipients.

Rina, in response, denied Yeoh's claims and insisted that no parties were forgotten or left behind, with more than 260,000 food packs and various other assistance channeled since the movement control order first came into force on March 18."

PETALING JAYA, April 20 — The newfound love and appreciation Malaysians have for Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah seems to be growing stronger each passing day.
The 56-year-old has received extensive praise in recent weeks for his handling of the Covid-19 outbreak in the country, catching the attention of people both locally and internationally, with many feeling a new sense of admiration for Dr Noor Hisham.
So much so that Malaysians decided to fill the health ministry’s live Facebook post of Dr Noor Hisham’s daily press conference yesterday with birthday wishes for their new hero—two days ahead of the actual date."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=151","Apr 21, 2020 10:39 AM","Elaine Tan","“The Health DG no longer needs any introduction, he has become a welcome face every day providing much-needed comfort and assurance to all Malaysians,” said the petition.
“His ever-composed demeanour calms the anxiety of Malaysians everywhere and his outstanding attention to detail and work ethic is now globally recognised.
“We hope that through this petition we can rally Malaysians behind the ministry of health, so that they may be continually motivated to know that the prayers, support and appreciation of all Malaysians are with them.”
The petition aims to collect one million signatures from Malaysians “united against Covid-19” to show their support and appreciation for Dr Noor Hisham and all frontliners in the country, with over 28,000 people signing it thus far.
“We sign off by wishing our beloved Dr Noor Hisham a very happy birthday, and may God bless him, all frontliners and their families the best of health,” said the petition.
Malaysia enters its 34th day of the movement control order period, with a total of 5,425 confirmed cases to date."

For them, Tunggu, siasat, selesai, to see how to let them off. Did anyone notice how quiet the IGP / DG MOH are on these high profile law breakers.

With the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the challenges facing healthcare personnel are slowly falling under the media spotlight. There is, however, another group of people in the government hospitals who stay in the shadows, risking their lives just to ensure that the patients and medical staff are always in a clean and sterile environment while fighting against the virus. These unsung heroes are hospital cleaners who perform a crucial role but have very few rights and benefits and whether one is a new worker or a 20-year veteran, the salaries are the same - the minimum wage of RM1,100. The remaining allowances and benefits are up to their respective contractors. Rita Santaran (above) took up the fight for the rights of such workers and lost her job in the midst of a takeover, although the new contractor, UEM Edgenta, told Malaysiakini that Rita was indeed offered the chance to continue her employment. A former chairperson of a hospital cleaners' union in Perak and a single mother with four children, Rita raised a whole family with a monthly wage of around RM1,000 (after deductions)."

She had worked in a departmental store, a factory and so on. But after giving birth to her children, Rita decided to work in a hospital, which is much closer to her house than the factories. “It is more convenient for me if I want to send my children to school, or go back home to see them,” she told Malaysiakini. In the early years of nationhood, cleaners in government hospitals were part of the civil service. This was until then prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad launched the national privatisation policy in 1983. At that time, the government decided to transfer the ""non-professional"" services under public agencies to the private contractors - this included cleaning and maintenance works. As a contract worker over the past seven years, Rita has gone through three different contractors and only one of them raised her salary - by RM50 - in 2015."

And he said the government launched this programme to give the opportunities for contractors to be maju. “So, my question is, if all the contractors want to maju, how about us, the workers?"" Rita said. Hospital cleaning as a profession Rita spends her mornings on housekeeping as well as sending her children to school."

The shifts are 3pm to 11pm or 11pm to 7am, with only one and a half-days off a week. During her one-hour lunch break, she still has to be on call for contingency while having lunch. If any patient vomits, haemorrhages or bed-wets, the workers have to go to the ward and clean it up quickly. “If they cannot find us, they will complain to our office and we will get a warning letter,” Rita said. Cleaning in hospitals is different from cleaning in banks, schools or other office spaces. According to Rita, there are strict procedures to be followed in a cleaning task, including certain detergents or powders to be applied first and certain kinds of mops to be used next."

Two years ago, Rita and several colleagues contracted shingles (herpes zoster) after cleaning up the blood of a dialysis patient. “That uncle bled a lot, the chair was full of his blood, I had to clean it. I was also not very healthy at the time, I had a cough. So I got infected very soon after.” “It spread to my back and my hands until I couldn't lift one of my hands.”"

She also noted that the medical allowance was too little for cleaners, considering their constant exposure to disease. Bullied by employer after husband’s death Four years ago, Rita’s husband passed away suddenly, after a month of fever, leaving her to support the children. The grief, coupled with the stress of making a living, affected Rita’s working performance and the supervisor changed her workplace to a bigger building. “I worked in the hospital's Emergency Department before, with stable working times. I was moved to the students' hostel. A very big building with more workload and almost no one to interact with. That made my trauma more serious.” After Rita protested, the supervisor agreed to reassign her - on condition that she give up stable working hours for shift work. ""He knew that I had just become a single mother, and if I worked the night shift, there would be no one to take care of my children. I had no choice but to accept it.” After facing unreasonable treatment for many years, Rita realised how the contract system exploits workers and she became braver about confronting her bosses to defend the rights of the workers. “During the meeting they will scold us and talk to us as if we are very low, telling us to go and die. I told them that they, being the leaders, shouldn’t talk like this. It’s unfair. “My colleagues thought I’m fierce, but actually I’m not. It’s already 2020, we have to improve.

In 2016, M Sarasvathy, the then deputy president of Party Sosialis Malaysia (PSM), went to meet the cleaners at the government hospital where Rita worked, to explain the plan of forming a workers’ union. Rita and several colleagues decided to join the union, which had not been officially registered yet at that time. “Saras (Sarasvathy) told us that the aim to form a union is to help the workers. Since we have been contract workers for a long time and the employer didn't give us reasonable treatment, no salary increments, she suggested we join the union. “And we joined, despite the union not being registered at that time.

Saras and her comrades went to 22 hospitals in northern Malaysia to explain the concept of the union to the cleaners, helping those in each hospital to establish their own union. The government hospital where Rita worked had 47 cleaners. As of last December, 37 cleaners had joined the union. Rita and her colleagues had deep discussions about the plight of workers under the contract system. “We always discuss our problems in the union. Most of us have the awareness. Why don’t we ask for our rights, ask to abolish the contract system?” Indeed in the middle of last year, a documentary titled ""Bila Kami Bersatu"" filmed the daily struggles of a union of hospital cleaners."

Thirty-eight out of the 43 demands listed by the union had been accepted by the employer, except for those involving money such as bonuses and increments. It was a great moment for them. However, the workers were then informed that they would come under a new subcontractor again, this year. The new subcontractor, Edgenta UEMS, is in charge of cleaning services in 32 hospitals in northern Malaysia and is under a public-listed government-linked company (GLC), UEM Edgenta. For the record, the UEM Group has been a fully-owned subsidiary of Khazanah Nasional Berhad since 2001."

Besides that, the employer said the ""new workers"" should attend an interview, and those selected will be under a three-months probationary period. Those who cannot read and write would be terminated. The company refused to recognise the collective agreements that had been sighed with the previous contractors and said that the union would be automatically ""disbanded"" when the company takes over. Tense times after protest The union then mobilised over a hundred cleaners from several hospitals in northern Malaysia to stage a protest in front of the Health Ministry in Putrajaya. Rita was one among them. They sat in front of the Health Ministry in Putrajaya, asking to see the then Health Minister Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad"

According to Rita, one of the high-profile leaders of the new subcontractor was also present and promised the cleaners that they would become permanent staff and the protesters would not be dismissed. Eventually, the workers did not have to fill in job applications forms or undergo probation but they realised that their benefits were cut after receiving the offer letters. Thus, many of them signed the offer letters with a note - “Received with objection' (Terima dengan bantahan)” to express their dissatisfaction."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=152","Apr 22, 2020 12:58 PM","Wellington Sky","After that, representatives from the union, Edgenta UEMS and the Health Ministry, met several times to negotiate the matter. Ultimately, the employer agreed to issue a new offer letter to those who signed under ""Received with objection"" while the union would issue a formal letter to explain the reasons for the objection. However, Rita said she and five other workers didn’t receive the new offer letters. Four out of the six of them had participated in the demonstration in Putrajaya. At the time of writing, Rita has been out of work for four months. With the Covid-19 outbreak, she lost her part-time job recently. Although she believe that her termination was due to union-busting, she has never regretted her decision to be active in the union. “Only when the union is strong enough, can we get what we deserve.” Touchingly, the union members who have continued in their jobs are now donating so that their unemployed comrades can receive up to RM200 per month. “If not for the union, I think no one would help us.” Rita and the other workers have filed a police report as well as a complaint with the Industrial Relations Department on Jan 3, 2020, on the issue of unjust dismissal. According to Rita, after the protest in Putrajaya, workers who played an active role in the union started to be targeted by the employer. Their working schedules and workplaces have been changed. Sadly, some colleagues who are non-union members tipped off their supervisor when Rita and her colleagues talked about the union activities. “My supervisors asked me what I would get by joining the union. I said I could get my rights, and he stopped asking me. But he will tell my colleagues not to be like me or they will lose their jobs. ” Despite the bumps and turns, the formation of unions has shaken up the rigid structure of labour and loosened the unequal relationship between supervisors and workers. Rita recalls that before the union was formed, the answer to any complaint would often be: ""You can quit if you don’t like the job."" Or, there would simply be no response. “After the union was formed, our supervisors are more careful and act on our complaints. They will tell us not to complain to the union because the union will send a formal letter to fight for the rights of workers.” UEM Edgenta says it is committed to job security When responding to Rita’s claims, UEM Edgenta told Malaysiakini that there was no attempt to sideline or terminate the six workers and that the workers themselves refused to accept the employment offer without the note ""Terima dengan bantahan""."

However, the six individuals refused.” “Hence the positions were offered to other applicants to ensure uninterrupted operations at the mentioned hospitals.” According to the statement, UEM Edgenta had offered a permanent employment status for the workers, which brings them additional benefits and value. “The aim is to provide the cleansing operatives with more job security and it would be easier for them to apply for banking facilities such as loans.” “Over 2,200 individuals, the majority of them former employees of the subcontractors, had accepted the employment offer unconditionally, and were recruited as new Edgenta UEMS permanent employees.” Furthermore, the company claimed that it was not legally bound by the collective agreement (CA) between the union and the previous subcontractor NS Medik Sdn Bhd as it is not the ""transferee, assignee or successor"" as stated in the CA. “This was not a take-over or merger or an acquisition, nor was it a change in business ownership. Edgenta UEMS is a separate entity altogether and has no relationship with NS Medik Sdn. Bhd.” While she struggles to defend workers’ rights, Rita never relaxes her fight for the livelihood of her entire family. She expressed worries about her son who is going to take his SPM exam early next year. “I should have sent him for tuition, but I'm unemployed and can't afford it."" One of her daughters is waiting for her STPM results and work part-time at a petrol station. “She'll help with the household expenses, but I want her to save the money.

But it also requires some capital to set up a business, so we are still considering it.” Currently, Rita is still waiting to hear feedback from her complaint to the Industrial Relations Department. “Of course, (if favourable) I would return to work at the hospital.

Contractors are businessmen/women, whose sole intention is to make big money, by
tightening on expenses and salaries. Contract Workers are also deprived of medical and hospitalization benefits.

PSM shouldn’t work in isolation in organizing the workers in the style of MTUC, CUEPACS or even NUPW. We are in the era of publicly funded social welfare system with well supported civil societies in the respective field. PSM must tap into welfare Payment systems to assist the low income earning workers if they lose the job in the event of organizing the labour. We must tap into the funds available with the ministries to run cooperative societies. The civil societies can do this with the assistance of retirees of the healthcare industry to bid the public-funded cleaning contracts in the sector. The collaborative system can tap into HRDF to train its members to qualify for the corporate type contracts to empower the low income earning population socially and economically.

In a bid to help those who lack the necessary finances to purchase groceries and food during the Movement Control Order period, the Malaysian government has taken upon the duty to distribute food packs to those who fall under the B40 category recently.
Each was said to contain over RM100 worth of groceries that included basic essentials such as rice and cooking oil."

If that wasn’t already bad enough in terms of delay, Mr Cha found out that instead of the 950 packs of food he requested, he only received 150.
And this is after the Ministry told him that his region would receive 1,000 food packs, instead of 950, in an updated list."

Almost to compensate for the countless others who slog day and night at personal risk to themselves to keep the country safe.
Using just Rasah as an example, the swindle would be more than the already obscene amount siphoned off, which seems a simple RM100 – RM35, that is, RM65 per packet. It must be remembered that the contents of the aid packages running into the thousands would have been purchased in bulk with discounts given by the supplier. Thus an aid-bag with a price tag of RM35 may actually cost about only RM30. And we thus encounter the new norm – from RM100 for the poor, steal RM70. This does not even include other features of ingenuity like items past their use-by dates and 5kgs mysteriously becoming 3kgs.
The first official reaction to the accusations would be that these Opposition MPs have a secret agenda and are bent on presenting the government in bad light when it is dedicated and sincere in its efforts. It is almost certain that there would be no follow-up action, no investigation, no nothing. That is because if we dig deep enough, we will find that those responsible for a scam of this magnitude would be much higher in the pecking order, old wine in old bottles.
That loud noise you just heard was PAS, UMNO, and Bersatu leaders keeping their silence."

History will be made on May 18 as Parliament is set to convene for only a day with one party being represented on both sides of the floor. Bersatu, which is leading the broad Perikatan Nasional coalition, will have members led by its president Muhyiddin Yassin on the government bench while a smaller group led by its chairperson Dr Mahathir Mohamad will sit with the opposition. This will likely be a perplexing and unprecedented scenario, one which many Bersatu leaders, save for Mahathir, are unwilling to go on record for when contacted by Malaysiakini. Some claimed that there was a gag order. On April 20, Mahathir made it clear that he will not join the government bench and that Bersatu - which means ""to unite"" or ""to be one"" - was essentially split in two. ""So, the faction against the government cannot sit together with the faction with the government,"" he said. Parliament has yet to update its website with the seating arrangement."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=155","Apr 24, 2020 12:33 PM","MoneyMaker168","Based on the experience of Perak in 2009 - the only other incident of a change in government mid-term - the new seating arrangement will only be revealed on the day of the sitting. Can't stop Dr M According to a party insider, who spoke to Malaysiakini on condition of anonymity, the party leadership cannot punish Mahathir for sitting on the opposition bench. He said the party rules stipulate that a member can only be dismissed if the person joins another party, contests in an election for public office against a Bersatu candidate, sues the party or loses Malaysian citizenship. ""What is the offence (if Mahathir sits with the opposition)? There is no offence,"" said the source. Several party leaders were in agreement that any attempt to sanction Mahathir or other party MPs siding with the opposition would be difficult and a drawn-out process. A complaint would have to be lodged with the disciplinary committee in which an investigation would follow. The member being investigated will also have to present himself before the committee for a hearing."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=155","Apr 24, 2020 12:33 PM","MoneyMaker168","Another party leader expressed doubt that Muhyiddin would have the gumption to take action against Mahathir - the founding member of the party. ""Do they dare to take action against party member number one? The party is already unstable as it is,"" said the source. Prior to the movement control order (MCO), Mahathir and his allies had been conducting roadshows to rally party members against Muhyiddin for pulling off the ""Sheraton Move"" in late February and installing himself as prime minister. Although the bulk of Bersatu MPs backed Muhyiddin, it has caused deep divisions within the party. Will there be negotiations? Several party leaders told Malaysiakini that the Muhyiddin faction might find ways to avoid the potential embarrassment by hiding the split. For instance, Bersatu supreme council member and long-time Mahathir loyalist Abu Bakar Yahya said the seating arrangement is controlled by PAS' Takiyuddin Hassan, who is the law minister and therefore also in charge of Parliamentary affairs. ""If we really know Tun (Mahathir), he is not the type who would break the rules. ""We would only know for sure when the letter informing of the seating arrangement comes,"" said Abu Bakar, who is also Mahathir's political secretary. At the time of writing, one attempts to establish if there were any efforts by Muhyiddin's faction to extend the olive branch to Mahathir has been unsuccessful."

""It is unprecedented but we are living in unprecedented times,"" he said. Rais added that Bersatu also needs to look at the matter carefully so as not to worsen the rift between its two top leaders and break the party further apart. ""My hope is that there would be some form of reconciliation between the two top leaders in the greater interests of the nation given that we are facing a very portent pandemic."" Asked if there were efforts to mend ties between Muhyiddin and Mahathir, Rais said it was a work in progress. ""Muhyiddin extended the olive branch from his inaugural speech as prime minister.

That's why they can bully Muhiddyin openly without worry about consequences, that's why Muhiyddin can't enforce discipline within PN.
Can you imagine if DAP did the same thing by demanding position openly?
Despite some noises, Tun M was treated with respect in PH. PH even agreed to let him be PM as long as he wants, Anwar said give him space to do necessary to save the country.

So far all indications are that Tun is waiting for the MCO to be over to make his move. The PH has also not made a decision on who is to be the Opposition leader since they need to consult with other parties and groups in the Opposition like Warisan, the Mahathir faction, Upko, PSB and other Independent MPs. Neither has PH refused to work with Tun. So to those who are ardent supporters of Muhyiddin here, do not be so overconfident about the direction of Tun and PH.

Attorney-General Idrus Harun has dismissed claims by a civil rights NGO that his office had failed to provide prosecutors with guidelines, leading to allegations of prosecutors going overboard in meting out punishments for those violating the movement control order (MCO). ""Nothing could be further from the truth,"" said Idrus (photo) in a statement issued today in response to claims by Eliminating Death And Abuse In Custody Together (Edict) that unlike other institutions involved in the administration of justice, the Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) had failed to issue guidelines to prosecutors to ensure even-handed implementation and enforcement of the MCO. He said guidelines and directives are regularly issued to the deputy public prosecutors (DPPs). ""The DPPs are also governed by a code of ethics. Monitoring of court cases involving breaches of MCO is done every day by the head of the Prosecution Division and his deputies."" Idrus added that DPPs are required to send a report on those cases daily to the AG. ""As an example, DPPs were reminded recently to be particularly sensitive to cases involving juveniles to ensure they are not remanded except in the most unavoidable of circumstances and they are treated in a court for children under the Child Act."" He, however, said some matters, like remand and sentencing, are not within the purview of the AG."

Earlier this month, it cited the case of a 61-year-old cardiologist who was brought to a courtroom in handcuffs after being nabbed while jogging, students at a college in Penang who were handcuffed and chained together, poor fishermen unable to pay RM1,000 fines and a starving Form Six student languishing in Marang prison because his family could not raise RM800 bail. Edict had also claimed that some VIPs and politicians had gotten away with committing MCO violations. Idrus said the actions and decisions of the AG, as well as those of the DPPs, are based on powers and responsibilities conferred by the Federal Constitution and the law. ""Edict appears to have made the erroneous assumption that just because they have not sighted any directives or guidelines by the AG, therefore there must be none."" ""This is not true. DPPs, as well as the police and the court, have been working hard under novel conditions while potentially exposing themselves to the risk of infection,"" he said. Idrus added that while the AGC, being a public institution, welcomes criticism of its actions, they should be constructive and based on facts duly established and not on conjecture and diatribe which are not fact-checked."

2. AGC cannot initiate prosecution without complete/actionable investigation papers by police. If an incident is reported in the media but police has not been quick to investigate and supply the papers to AGC, then the case cannot proceed.
3. AGC then vigorously prosecutes the case in court, subject to any plea bargaining by defence. AGC seeks to maximise punishment or bail in line with the law and severity of the case. It does not mitigate the accused's action as that is up to the accused counsel to do so and neither does it overstep into adjudicating the matter before the court.
4. The sentencing is done by the courts/justices/magistrates and beyond the AGC's purview
5. There is an internal mechanism that happens within AG's chambers to monitor on prosecution of offences. AG denies there is any over zealous prosecution or activism or selective prosecution based on its role in the process
6. In short Mr AG is saying, I don't own the whole process. Indirectly, he is implying De Facto Law Minister, Chief Justice, Home Minister, IGP all have to do their part

For a man who was deeply involved in a political coup early this year, it’s strange for Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin to say that people are fed up with politics and instead wanted to the government to work hard for the people."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=158","Apr 28, 2020 2:09 PM","Wellington Sky","Most people can see that it is actually the main players in his fledgling Perikatan Nasional government that are jostling for positions and power during this current crisis of Covid-19 outbreak in Malaysia.
Perhaps the Prime Minister made the remarks in his attempt to hide the fact that, at this moment, he is merely a sitting duck despite his immense powers as the head of the government.
Why do I say this? Let me begin with a true story. Lim Kit Siang and I rushed back from our events in Johor on 25 July 2015 at the request of Parti Keadilan Rakyat’s Secretary-General Saifuddin Nasution Ismail for an emergency discussion. As close allies, we consult each other regularly, especially on major developments in politics."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=158","Apr 28, 2020 2:09 PM","Wellington Sky","Saifuddin told us he heard that Attorney-General Abdul Gani Patail was going to charge Prime Minister Najib Razak for abuse of power in the SRC case in the following week. Kit Siang took time to ponder, and said to us: “Will Najib be a sitting duck waiting to be slaughtered?”
Three days after that, on 28 July 2015, Gani, Muhyiddin and Shafie Apdal were sacked from the Barisan Nasional government."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=158","Apr 28, 2020 2:09 PM","Wellington Sky","Now back to today. Muhyiddin is governing his shaky coalition with 10 groups within PN.
There are four factions in Bersatu – those who joined in 2016, those who joined Bersatu from UMNO after Pakatan Harapan won the general election in 2018; Azmin Ali’s group; and Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s supporters who could create an upset in the Bersatu party election which has been delayed ostensibly due to Covid-19 situation.
Another four are competing factions in UMNO; each led by Najib, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, Hishammuddin Hussein, and a non-aligned group which include Mohammad Hassan and Khairy Jamaluddin.
The other two consist of PAS and Gabungan Parti Sarawak."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=158","Apr 28, 2020 2:10 PM","Wellington Sky","Muhyiddin’s options
Ideally, Muhyiddin would want to get rid of the Mahathir supporters, and to find a way not to have Bersatu party elections. He wants to avoid Mukhriz Mahathir’s challenge for Bersatu presidency, although it’s difficult for the Kedah Mentri Besar to win but it’s not an impossible task.
Muhyiddin also knows that among the four UMNO factions, he could only trust Hishammuddin Hussein’s group.
PKR renegade Azmin Ali is hoping to have a party structure that he could play a significant role and could bring in his grassroots supporters who currently has no political home due to the limbo in Bersatu. He also needs to create a political space for his non-Malay supporters who are no longer welcome in PKR yet has nowhere to go.
For Muhyiddin’s government to gain legitimacy, he needs to show that he runs a clean government. The voters, particularly the deciding swing voters among the Malays, value integrity highly, apart from economic wellbeing.
Apart from ensuring jobs and economic wellbeing for ordinary Malaysians, the Prime Minister must show voters that he is committed to fighting corruption, oherwise he would never gain moral legitimacy for launching the political coup against the democratically elected government of Pakatan Harapan.
To convince the people, he needs to demonstrate his commitment to fighting corruption by allowing justice to take its course – for Najib and Rosmah Mansor, Tengku Adnan Mansor and Zahid to go to jail when they are convicted by courts for corruption.
The only problem is, can he do so without UMNO revolting?"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=158","Apr 28, 2020 2:10 PM","Wellington Sky","If waiting for court conviction is too much of leaving to chance, could Muhyiddin resort to breaking up both UMNO and Bersatu at the same time before the UMNO big wigs strike back?
New party?
There is a rumour in the city that Muhyiddin, Azmin and Hishammuddin are trying to form a new party. For them, this could be a brilliant solution to solve all the problems. There’s no need to worry about Bersatu election, Azmin’s supporters could find a political home, and Hishammudin’s faction could bring the real support that Muhyiddin needed.
However, there are two challenges for this plan.
First, Muhyiddin has only a maximum of 113 or 114 seats. If Pakatan Harapan parties (PKR, DAP, Amanah) and Warisan, as well as Mahathir faction of Bersatu MPs stick together, Muhyiddin has no room to maneuver.
If Muhyiddin, Azmin and Hishammuddin manage to break up this “Pakatan plus” coalition, they would be able to form their new party without the need to have both Najib and Zahid’s groups. In their calculations, they probably would attempt to lure the support of a few Pakatan MPs.
Second, Muhyiddin must be very careful with Johor UMNO. Its leaders are so eager to wrest power they lost in the last GE.
My friendly advice to the Prime Minister whom I used to work very closely with and had many candid conversations during our time as PH partners is this: UMNO could pull a fast one on him in his own backyard in Johor.
A snap election in Johor may mean the end of Bersatu in the state, as well as Muhyiddin could even lose his Bukit Gambir state seat.
In these tense political undercurrents, it could be Muhyiddin that would trigger something to tear down and tame his UMNO challengers. Or it could be Johor UMNO that would trigger the beginning of the onslaught against the Prime Minister.
For Pakatan Harapan and the allies who choose to side with us, such as Warisan and the Mahathir faction of Bersatu, we must stick together. Malaysians who voted for Pakatan Harapan expecting a clean government and better economic opportunities will still support us."

Why doesn't this so called 'political strategist' sort out the shortcomings of his unstable and treacherous political coalition? Rather than being the self appointed 'Mr Fixit' for Muhyiddin, Chin Tong should spend his time strategising for a political realignment of Opposition forces who subscribe to a united, democratic, equal, non-racial and non-sectarian Malaysia. The old political formula is inherently unstable whereby there is a subtext of 'Ketuanan Melayu' and 'Ketuanan Islam'. Chin Tong must unashamedly reject the politics of tacit genuflection to Malay and Islamic political hegemony.
It has become self evident that Pakatan Harapan was a coalition of unhappy bedfellows having different political agendas. So much so, the Rakyat was betrayed when the Manifesto which cynically cast aside by Mahathir who deliberately allowed the disparate political agendas to run amuck and cause Pakatan Harapan to be so unstable and divisive.
Why did Chin Tong and his party the DAP, and even PKR play dumb and not stand up to all the treachery which was going on within the PH government? They allowed the government to sleepwalk into sure collapse. Now Chin Tong is now pontificating after the fact, but it is misdirected. He should focus instead on regrouping and rebuilding Pakatan Harapan so it can be an effective Opposition. Forget about forming the next government when 'strategists' like Chin Tong cannot see the wood for the trees and wastes time being the unsolicited political advisor to Muhyiddin!
Chin Tong may not realise this, but the current mood of the people is with the Muhyiddin government which is viewed to be effective in handling the Covid pandemic and there is a sense of gratitude for this. We no longer hear strident voices of racism, religious bigotry and irrationality which characterized the PH government. If Muhyiddin and his possible successor Hishammudin can continue to rein in these divisive forces in Malaysian politics then it would be seen as 'effective' government worth re-electing despite its obvious shortcomings.
People just want to get on with their lives and live in peace and harmony. The Pakatan Harapan government did everything possible to hurt and inflame the racial and religious pride of every citizen during its short tenure. I believe the modus operandi had Mahathir Mohammad's finger prints all over it. His pointed refusal to name a date to transfer power over to Anwar Ibrahim as he was mandated to do created political instability within the coalition and set into motion a factional war and a grab for power through treacherous means.
Mahathir Mohammad was outfoxed by Muhyiddin and Azmin who brought forward the time line of the planned collapse of Pakatan Harapan. Mahthir's agenda now is to make sure Anwar Ibrahim does not become the next PM as well as use the Opposition's strength to bargain for a senior position for his son Mukriz in any future government. That is why Bersatu is represented in both sides of the political divide, so much for integrity and political principle.
How pathetic to see Pakatan Harapan still hanging on to the coattails of Mahathir. It is a measure of their disarray and lack of principle."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=159","Apr 28, 2020 3:30 PM","alipay88","The reality is PN isn’t having the numbers or Mukhydin doesn’t trust PasDumno or Umno . Probably Anwar was called by Mukyhiddin last week for a support meeting in event of floor test. Looks like Anwar hasn’t given him the support for votes. The Parliament seating will probably be for morning session. Mukyiddin hasn’t withdrawn Najib or Zahid court cases and so Umno may trigger vote of no confidence and withdraw support and Mukh regime will collapse. Umno probably with Pas thinks they can win GE15 if called. Initially they preferred elections. Ex11PKR and PPBM is desperate to get the numbers probably without Umno due to many demands so the SG of PPBM is travelling but why if not recruiting. Moreover Prabha not agreeing to Afif request to join PN was probably reason for uncouth bad treatment by Sanatara when Prabha went to meet him.
That could be reason why Mahathir hasn’t moved to PN while also being gatekeeper on Anwar . PH should be wise and Anwar should be opposition Chief in Parliament and PM candidate.
Chin Tong if Mahathir is going to be PM candidate for PH now than better let PN rule at least all the race hating , pendatang , religious and race bigotry etc by mahathir has stopped."

After certain economic sectors have been allowed to resume full operations, Lembah Pantai MP Fahmi Fadzil said Parliament should be allowed to operate fully as well.
“Parliament should be made one of the sectors allowed full operations.
“Democracy is critical to the running of transparent and responsible administration,” Fahmi (photo) said in a tweet today.
The Dewan Rakyat is due to convene on May 18, but its 15-day session has been slashed to just one day.
This would allow the lower house to discuss government bills and business, but there would be no oral question sessions, written questions, motions, and special chambers.
MPs would have to undergo Covid-19 tests and temperature screening before joining the session and would sit at least a metre apart from one another.
Opposition MPs have criticised the shortened session, while PKR president Anwar Ibrahim argued for parliament to sit for at least two days to allow some debate.
Earlier today, International Trade and Industry Minister Azmin Ali said economic sectors allowed to operate during the movement control order period would be allowed to operate at full capacity starting tomorrow.
However, companies must comply with standard operating procedures set by the government.
Health Ministry director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said the ministry has prepared new procedures for all economic sectors.
Construction and other major industries would be given priority to reopen first, followed b the services sector."

1.How does this lockdown hurt their financial and how long will their financial recover in the future?
2.How will people react after reopen? will people rush to crowded area example cinema, beach or shopping?
3.How long post-covid fear will remain?
4.How long will our boarder still close or will Malaysia be like China quarantine whoever enter from oversea
5.How will gov act on the social distance policy after reopen?
For me, i think leisure/travel/hospitality industry will at least get hurt for 2 QR. Most people will still avoid crowded place for atleast 3-6month as human fear will not disappear like magic(unless medicine or vaccine is ready). Malaysia will still close boarder to tourist as many country still high in positive covid cases.
i personally think MCO will extend to end of May but in the mean time factory will resume work with health guide line , because Gov can't undertake the consequences of second wave in Hari Raya. u can see although China did ""well"" in handling covid, but there were many cases of no symptom people tested positive and there were 1 people with no symptom spread virus to around 80 people recently in Harbin.
Don't blindly listen to financial house analysis , ask your friend ,family or neighbor how they will act after reopen.
the reason for my post is that ,do be cautious on your strategy entering stock because the potential downside is still high.
But for technology stock, its a good time to buy, nothing will effect tech stock! Ir4.0 is the FUTURE!
my conclusion is that ,for ARBB 7181 is a very good company and i hold some of its stock. My strategy is i will average if it goes down, or enter if breakout."

The health authority has detected mutations of Covid-19 virus in the country and warns of their aggressive infectivity.
According to Health director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah, one of the mutations they found was in ""Case 26"" who had so far infected 120 others.
""We were made to understand that there are 30 mutations of the virus so far. And in the Institute for Medical Research (IMR), we are doing virus isolation and virus culture.
""We have found that 'Case 26', for example, had one mutation. And maybe because of this mutation it caused the virus to become more aggressive, infecting 120 others.
""The new mutations are even more aggressive, that is for sure,"" said Noor Hisham.
He was speaking at a press conference in Putrajaya today where he was asked about a study in India which found 10 mutations of the Covid-19.
For the record, ""Case 26"" has been identified as Hisham Hamdan, who is the chairperson of UDA Holdings and executive director of Khazanah.
He had come forward to identify himself as ""Case 26"" early last month following media reports and online criticisms against him for allegedly causing a cluster of infections.
""Case 26"" had travelled to Shanghai, China in mid-January before he started developing symptoms on Feb 27. He then sought treatment at the Subang Jaya Medical Centre. He was later treated at the Sungai Buloh Hospital after being tested positive with Covid-19, which also saw health authority scrambling to test all his close contacts and family members.
Elaborating further about mutations of Covid-19 in the country, Noor Hisham said IMR had established that most of the positive cases detected in the first wave and early part of the second wave of the outbreak were of Strain B.
Strain B is the strain that was traced back to Wuhan, China, while Strain A was mostly found in the US and Strain C mostly found in Europe.
""What is important now is to conduct research on the second wave of the outbreak which involved our positive patients who returned from certain countries,"""

ARB active, rises 9% on emergence of US-based Caravan Capital as new substantial shareholder
KUALA LUMPUR (April 29): Interest in shares of Main Market-listed ARB Bhd spiked after a US-based investment firm had yesterday emerged as the company’s new substantial shareholder.
At 9.40am, the counter was up 2.5 sen or 9.09% at 30 sen, giving it a market capitalization of RM88.14 million. Some 37.85 million shares were traded, exceeding its 200-day average volume of 8.61 million shares, making it the fifth most actively traded counter at the time of writing.
Over the past year, the counter has fallen by 43.4% from 53 sen. But since falling to a low of 10.5 sen on March 19, the stock has rebounded 185.71% within a six-week period.
In a filing to Bursa Malaysia yesterday, ARB said US-based investment management firm Caravan Capital Management LLC has emerged as a substantial shareholder after acquiring a 6.3% stake in the information technology (IT) software and platform provider.
Caravan Capital acquired the stake comprising 18.5 million shares on the open market last Friday.
The shares are held through MIRI Strategic Emerging Markets Fund LP (11.26 million shares or a 3.89% stake) and Kenneth Rainin Foundation (7.07 million shares or a 2.41% stake).
For the full year ended Dec 31, 2019 (FY19), ARB’s net profit soared 8.2 times to RM34.77 million, from RM4.23 million in the previous year, while revenue jumped 6.7 times to RM102.64 million, from RM15.26 million.
The higher earnings are attributable to higher revenue from the IT division, in which ARB believes will continue growing and contribute profit to the group.
The major revenue contributors were wholly-owned subsidiaries ARB Development Sdn Bhd and ARBIOT Sdn Bhd, which are both principally involved in the business of reselling customized enterprise resource planning (ERP) software system, and Internet of Things, Internet and Multimedia development, and consultancy services
Apart from its IT-related businesses, ARB is also involved in the manufacturing of wood products. However, the group's timber segment temporarily ceased operations in the third quarter of FY19, ahead of an expected resumption in December 2019.
Under its segment breakdown analysis for FY19, the manufacturing in wood products did not generate any revenue for the year and saw a net loss of RM1.64 million."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=163","Apr 30, 2020 2:58 PM","THEREALDEAL","How Does ARB Berhad’s P/E Compare To Its Industry, After Its Big Share Price Gain?
ARB Berhad shares have had a really impressive month, gaining 119%, after some slippage. But shareholders may not all be feeling jubilant, since the share price is still down 44% in the last year.
Assuming no other changes, a sharply higher share price makes a stock less attractive to potential buyers. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). So some would prefer to hold off buying when there is a lot of optimism towards a stock. One way to gauge market expectations of a stock is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E implies that investors have high expectations of what a company can achieve compared to a company with a low P/E ratio.
How Does ARB Berhad’s P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?
ARB Berhad’s P/E of 2.57 indicates relatively low sentiment towards the stock. We can see that the average P/E (19.5) for companies in the it industry is higher than ARB Berhad’s P/E.
Its relatively low P/E ratio indicates that ARB Berhad shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. Since the market seems impressed with ARB Berhad, it’s quite possible it could surprise on the upside. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.
How Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios
Earnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. That’s because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the ‘E’ in the equation. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.
ARB Berhad’s 82% EPS improvement over the last year was like bamboo growth after rain; rapid and impressive.
A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The Bank
One drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).
Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.
So What Does ARB Berhad’s Balance Sheet Tell Us?
With net cash of RM43m, ARB Berhad has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business. Having said that, at 49% of its market capitalization the cash hoard would contribute towards a higher P/E ratio.
The Verdict On ARB Berhad’s P/E Ratio
ARB Berhad has a P/E of 2.6. That’s below the average in the MY market, which is 12.5. Not only should the net cash position reduce risk, but the recent growth has been impressive. The relatively low P/E ratio implies the market is pessimistic. What is very clear is that the market has become less pessimistic about ARB Berhad over the last month, with the P/E ratio rising from 1.2 back then to 2.6 today. For those who like to invest in turnarounds, that might mean it’s time to put the stock on a watchlist, or research it. But others might consider the opportunity to have passed.
Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about. As value investor Benjamin Graham famously said, ‘In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine. Although we don’t have analyst forecasts you could get a better understanding of its growth by checking out this more detailed historical earnings, revenue and cash flow.
But note: ARB Berhad is one of the best stock to buy."

ARB Berhad shares have had a really impressive month, gaining 119%, after some slippage. But shareholders may not all be feeling jubilant, since the share price is still down 44% in the last year.
Assuming no other changes, a sharply higher share price makes a stock less attractive to potential buyers. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). So some would prefer to hold off buying when there is a lot of optimism towards a stock. One way to gauge market expectations of a stock is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E implies that investors have high expectations of what a company can achieve compared to a company with a low P/E ratio.
How Does ARB Berhad’s P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?
ARB Berhad’s P/E of 2.57 indicates relatively low sentiment towards the stock. We can see that the average P/E (19.5) for companies in the it industry is higher than ARB Berhad’s P/E.
Its relatively low P/E ratio indicates that ARB Berhad shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. Since the market seems impressed with ARB Berhad, it’s quite possible it could surprise on the upside. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.
How Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios
Earnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. That’s because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the ‘E’ in the equation. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.
ARB Berhad’s 82% EPS improvement over the last year was like bamboo growth after rain; rapid and impressive.
A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The Bank
One drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).
Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.
So What Does ARB Berhad’s Balance Sheet Tell Us?
With net cash of RM43m, ARB Berhad has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business. Having said that, at 49% of its market capitalization the cash hoard would contribute towards a higher P/E ratio.
The Verdict On ARB Berhad’s P/E Ratio
ARB Berhad has a P/E of 2.6. That’s below the average in the MY market, which is 12.5. Not only should the net cash position reduce risk, but the recent growth has been impressive. The relatively low P/E ratio implies the market is pessimistic. What is very clear is that the market has become less pessimistic about ARB Berhad over the last month, with the P/E ratio rising from 1.2 back then to 2.6 today. For those who like to invest in turnarounds, that might mean it’s time to put the stock on a watchlist, or research it. But others might consider the opportunity to have passed.
Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about. As value investor Benjamin Graham famously said, ‘In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine. Although we don’t have analyst forecasts you could get a better understanding of its growth by checking out this more detailed historical earnings, revenue and cash flow.
But note: ARB Berhad is one of the best stock to buy."

He instead left the party earlier on Feb 24, said Fahmi
In a posting on his official Twitter account this morning, the Lembah Pantai MP dismissed the claim by the deputy federal territories minister Santhara that party president Anwar Ibrahim handed a dismissal letter to him (Santhara) on the day
PKR secretary-general Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail claims that the party is in the process of collecting the RM10mil in penalty imposed against anyone abandoning the party.
He said the matter is being dealt with by the PKR treasurer.
“We are in the process of getting those who defected to pay up,"" Saifuddin told reporters after a farewell do at the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry, where he has served as minister for 21 months.
In 2018, all PKR candidates for the 14th General Election signed a legal document to prevent them from defecting to another party.
The signing of the legal document, which will see elected representatives fined RM10mil should they defect to another party - has been a practice within PKR.
Among those who may have to pay up is Johor’s Pemanis assemblyman Dr Chong Fat Full, who announced his exit from PKR and stated his allegiance to the new state coalition government.
He was among 10 state exco members, who were sworn before the Sultan of Johor Sultan Ibrahim ibni Almarhum Sultan Iskandar earlier on Friday (March 6).
Several PKR lawmakers, who left the party after its deputy president Datuk Seri Azmin Ali and vice-president Zuraida Kamaruddin were sacked, may also have to pay the RM10mil penalty.
Saifuddin, who is also Pakatan Harapan secretary-general, said it was not game over for the coalition.
“We have a few things in our line-up, which we will announce from time to time, ” he said
Asked if this included bringing up the motion of no-confidence against the Prime Minister in the Parliament, Saifuddin replied in the affirmative."

KUALA LUMPUR: The government's move to relax restrictions under the Movement Control Order (MCO) can cause the Covid-19 pandemic to worsen and put workers lives at risk.
The Malaysian Trades Union Congress (MTUC) said Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin's announcement of the Conditional MCO (CMCO), which would see most businesses reopening from Monday onwards, came ""too fast, too soon.""
Its secretary-general J. Solomon in a statement today urged the premier to delay the implementation of the CMCO to allow more time for employers, workers, consumers to adjust and live under the ""new normal"".
""This will not take forever, but it will certainly take more than three days.
""And to make it work, the government machinery must be visible on the ground to help everyone make smooth transition to the new normal so that the economic recovery can be sustained and shielded from a fresh wave of Covid-19 attacks.
""It (the announcement) came as a shock. The government is doing too much to kick start the economy, given that the Covid-19 pandemic threat remains real in Malaysia.""
Solomon said the announcement was made despite figures showing that since April 25, more than half of the 380 new Covid-19 cases were local or community transmissions.
A total of 248 or 65.3 per cent of cases were community transmissions, compared to 132 imported cases (34.7 per cent).
The statistics clearly showed that a new wave of Covid-19 outbreak remained to be a possibility in the country and the number of hot spots across Malaysia was still high, he said.
These figures, he said, should have been sufficient for the government to see through the completion of the 4th phase of the MCO, scheduled to end on May 12, before considering the possibility of easing the restrictions.
Solomon cited developments in Japan, Singapore, Germany and Canada as examples to show how the situation could change dramatically if restrictions were lifted too soon.
""MTUC is worried that the government is acting hastily in doing away with many of the MCO curbs in the name of saving the country from further economic damage.
""No one wants to return to work more than the 15 million workers in the country. But has the government ensured that employers will put the safeguards in place for the safety of workers?
""Is there enough enforcement on the ground to ensure employers comply with the SOP drawn up by the Health Ministry? Are these health screenings actually taking place?""
All these, Solomon said, were important issues that needed to be addressed before companies be given the green light to resume operations.
He said the public and businesses should first be provided with all the relevant information as well as clarification on SOPs.
Local authorities, health officers, and those from the relevant ministries, he said, should ensure the SOPs complied with, before giving approval for these entities to operate.
This, he said, would instill public confidence and ensure the business community sustain their operations by maintaining the highest health care standards.
""MTUC cannot fathom the need for the government to lift major MCO restrictions with just a three-day notice to the rakyat, companies, restaurants, shopping malls, coffee shops which clearly need much more time in order to make the necessary adjustments.
""Another point to consider is the possibility of enforcement teams indulging in corruption, something which is not impossible based on past experiences in our enforcement teams. These, if allowed to happen, may be the cause of a second or third wave.""
MTUC also urged the government not to risk the health and safety of workers, both local and foreign as feedback gained showed that many employers who were earlier been allowed to operate ignored basic safety measures, such as the wearing of masks, use of sanitisers and social distancing.
""The poor, squalid, and cramped living conditions of many of the workers are a major cause of concern.""
Businesses, he said, need not worry about losing their in
come as once the MCO is totally lifted, people would rush to buy all the items that they lacked in huge quantities, hence they would regain their lost profits in no time."

I have every reason to believe, Mahathir leading PH would have done exactly the same and all others in his cabinet would have quietly played along...which they did when the coot embraced Zakir Naik first and later the traitors on October 6th last year.
Everything so far points to the virus being around for a while. There is no telling for how long. There is no vaccine is on the horizon. Just like in the case of HIV.
The problem, which politicians across the board should address, is the behavior of self-centered Malaysians, their indiscipline, their appalling lack of social etiquette, their impatience and sickening lack of civic consciousness. Obviously they have had poor role models in their political and religious leaders. And substandard education.
On top of that, the country is racially splintered by its leaders. Malay Muslim politicians to be exact. And one result of their divisive policies has been the building of a number of horribly congested, unhygenic Malay-majority low cost housing in urban areas - which now have turned out to be super spreader communes.
And then there is the problem of a migrant population of between six to ten million - two thirds of who have bought their way in by ""managing"" border guards. That is the result of another one of Mahathir's enduring stupidities - increase the number of muslims to increase his voter base while pushing migrants to his ""cheap-labor"" addicted businessmen cronies who also support their pusher. Smart partnership in his book.
These are just some of the reasons the country will remain at risk. Its past practices and crookedness do not guarantee a safe future. No amount of prayer is going to help. Neither will politicking either by the ousted fellows or by the ones now ruling the roost.
The economy has to be opened up at some point - and there is no time like the present. Professional risk assessment area by area and stringent even-handed enforcement of rules must accompany tentative, measured steps to enable livelihoods.
It calls for exceptional wisdom, ruthless enforcement of health directives and zero politicking."

Being appointed to a government position will not restrain Machang MP Ahmad Jazlan Yaakub from holding on to his principles.
The newly appointed Malaysian Palm Oil Board chairperson told Malaysiakini that he accepted the position to ""serve the country"", and not to be ""bound"" by others.
""I am saying sincerely, I am not restrained. If there are parties who think I could be restrained by giving me this GLC chairperson position, they are mistaken.
""[...] If they think, oh, 'Machang MP's problem is solved, we have given him a position'. This is a mistake.
""I have my own stand,"" he told Malaysiakini when contacted yesterday.
He did not mention any names although it is believed that his remarks were directed towards Umno's Perikatan Nasional ally Bersatu.
Despite Umno having the most federal seats among PN parties, Bersatu appeared to remain dominant, through party president Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin and former premier Dr Mahathir Mohamad.
The issue was extended to the distribution of positions among leaders from the two parties, with several Umno leaders claiming they were sidelined in Muhyiddin's cabinet.
Within Muhyiddin's cabinet, Umno leaders are said to been given portfolios with lesser responsibilities compared to Bersatu leaders who jumped from PKR, for example International Trade and Industry Minister Azmin Ali.
The controversy also swept Sabah and Johor with party leaders demanding for GLC positions and debating the new appointments.
Commenting on his own appointment as an Umno leader, Jazlan said he will only support a government that is truly working for the country.
""Which government I am supporting, so long as I see the government is really ensuring the country's sustainability, that I can support,"" he said.
Jazlan has been appointed as MPOB chairperson effective April 8.
Previously, a list of rumoured Umno leaders to be appointed as GLC heads had gone viral, including party deputy president Mohamad Hasan, said to be named as Tenaga Nasional Berhad chairperson.
Mohamad, however, has since confirmed that he rejected the offer.
Aside from Mohamad, other names on the list include Umno veteran Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah as Petronas chairperson, Umno vice-president Mahdzir Khalid as TM chairperson and Umno supreme council member Tajuddin Abdul Rahman as Prasarana Malaysia Bhd chairperson.
Both Mahdzir and Tajuddin, however, have said that they have yet to receive any confirmation regarding the rumoured appointments.

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=166","May 5, 2020 3:11 PM","THEREALDEAL","With its long stranglehold on Malay politics, its wide outreach and having far more seats than Bersatu and also viewing to recapture the seat of power, it will be foolish either way - either for UMNO not to consolidate its position or Bersatu expecting UMNO to be kind.
This is predatory politics, survival of the fittest, so to speak. This has very little to do with race and religion. With three parties racing to grab a bite on this race and religion pie, it has bared the nakedness of it all.
Of course, the winner of this game is undoubtedly UMNO. Bersatu was just a decoy, a ventilator just at the right time. Certainly it may not be working the way Azmin and Muyhiddin may have planned but they joined a team where ""winners take all"" will be more likely the endless game that may be played to the hilt, unlike in PH where it was more of give to Bersatu rather than the take business.
It got the coveted PM post. Certainly it did not deliver in GE14 with its 13 seats only. Yet the promise of a PM's post and MB's in non-majority Bersatu states and much more were honoured. But greed has no limits. Ignorance fared far worse. Bersatu was shielded and sheltered to provide sufficient room to grow and strengthen itself. There were sacrifices by component parties in PH to the extent that winning seats was not the yardstick to positions. Yet some of them had the audacity to run down the component parties and threatening to pull out from the coalition, which it did anyway.
Of course, Bersatu cannot expect to get the same leeway from UMNO, as it is painfully finding out. History is one thing but many were wondering as to why Bersatu was so greedy and unprincipled. When there is a promise to hand over the PM post to Anwar, the most honourable thing will be to keep that promise and do so at the earliest opportunity possible. A six-month window would have been more than enough.
Tun was supposed to be an interim PM, to hold the position and to facilitate a smooth transfer but it was very painful to see how he became so obsessed with the post. He and Bersatu started giving flimsy excuses and kept on shifting the goalposts. Compare with how Wan Azizah conducted herself. Besides allowing the use of the PKR flagship, she even turned down politely the offer of the PM position when the King mentioned it to her. Where is the honour. All our religions teach us to be honest. And the Bersatu people think they can get away with such a dishonourable act.
Bersatu thinks it is about Anwar, Of course that was just a tiny thing. They broke the promise they gave to a lady. Surely they cannot be left off the hook,can they? Just watch the game."

Veteran opposition MP Lim Kit Siang claimed that there was no consensus reached during a National Security Council meeting on April 28 with the chief executives of 13 states regarding the resumption of business.
In a statement today, the Iskandar Puteri MP claimed that Putrajaya should have called for a second meeting with the chief ministers and menteri besar of these states before imposing the conditional movement control order (MCO), which allowed most businesses to resume, on May 4.
""This is what (International Trade and Industry Minister) Azmin (Ali) should do now instead of issuing a dubious legal threat last night,"" said Lim, who is a DAP veteran leader.
At the time of writing, Malaysiakini is unable to independently verify Lim's stunning claims. Efforts to confirm this with state governments are currently underway.
It should also be noted that Chow Kon Yeow, the chief minister of Penang, is a senior member of DAP.
Lim was referring to Azmin's claim last night that the states which did not allow businesses to resume operations, in line with the federal government gazette issued by Health Ministry Dr Adham Baba on May 3, would risk being sued by business owners.
As of yesterday, six states - Sarawak, Sabah, Kelantan, Penang, Kedah and Pahang - have yet to reopen their economies.
Azmin also claimed that a consensus had arrived during the April 28 meeting after the chief executive of states were briefed that should the MCO be extended until June, the cumulative loss of national income would wipe out all the growth achieved over the past four years.
Lim said that the refusal to comply by some states was proof that there was no ""whole-of-government"" approach and an example of a ""shambolic"" exit plan with poor coordination.
He said Azmin should take pay heed to the chairperson of the Parliamentary select committee on federal/state Relations, Hassan Abdul Karim, who pointed out that federal and state governments are jointly given power on health matters under the ninth schedule of the Federal Constitution.
""It is urgent and imperative that the government adopt an 'all-of-government' and 'whole-of-society' approach with Parliament playing its oversight and scrutiny role to ensure the nation's success in the invisible war against Covid-19 pandemic.
""So far the government has acted as if it knows best when clearly it does not,"""

How Does ARB Berhad’s P/E Compare To Its Industry, After Its Big Share Price Gain?
ARB Berhad shares have had a really impressive month, gaining 119%, after some slippage. But shareholders may not all be feeling jubilant, since the share price is still down 44% in the last year.
Assuming no other changes, a sharply higher share price makes a stock less attractive to potential buyers. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). So some would prefer to hold off buying when there is a lot of optimism towards a stock. One way to gauge market expectations of a stock is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E implies that investors have high expectations of what a company can achieve compared to a company with a low P/E ratio.
How Does ARB Berhad’s P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?
ARB Berhad’s P/E of 2.57 indicates relatively low sentiment towards the stock. We can see that the average P/E (19.5) for companies in the it industry is higher than ARB Berhad’s P/E.
Its relatively low P/E ratio indicates that ARB Berhad shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. Since the market seems impressed with ARB Berhad, it’s quite possible it could surprise on the upside. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.
How Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios
Earnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios. That’s because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the ‘E’ in the equation. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.
ARB Berhad’s 82% EPS improvement over the last year was like bamboo growth after rain; rapid and impressive.
A Limitation: P/E Ratios Ignore Debt and Cash In The Bank
One drawback of using a P/E ratio is that it considers market capitalization, but not the balance sheet. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).
Such spending might be good or bad, overall, but the key point here is that you need to look at debt to understand the P/E ratio in context.
So What Does ARB Berhad’s Balance Sheet Tell Us?
With net cash of RM43m, ARB Berhad has a very strong balance sheet, which may be important for its business. Having said that, at 49% of its market capitalization the cash hoard would contribute towards a higher P/E ratio.
The Verdict On ARB Berhad’s P/E Ratio
ARB Berhad has a P/E of 2.6. That’s below the average in the MY market, which is 12.5. Not only should the net cash position reduce risk, but the recent growth has been impressive. The relatively low P/E ratio implies the market is pessimistic. What is very clear is that the market has become less pessimistic about ARB Berhad over the last month, with the P/E ratio rising from 1.2 back then to 2.6 today. For those who like to invest in turnarounds, that might mean it’s time to put the stock on a watchlist, or research it. But others might consider the opportunity to have passed.
Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about. As value investor Benjamin Graham famously said, ‘In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine. Although we don’t have analyst forecasts you could get a better understanding of its growth by checking out this more detailed historical earnings, revenue and cash flow.
But note: ARB Berhad is one of the best stock to buy."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=168","May 6, 2020 1:50 PM","Wellington Sky","My personal view,
PB figure is one of ""weakest"" indicator, and nowadays market doesn't emphasis too much on book value issue.
Market cares more about company on going forwards profitability and dividend yield.
Book value is something only good of viewing only.
Also, book value can be wiped off instantly, if a particular company business is out of favour or drastic changing business environment/industry.
Nowadays, we needs to look at specific company with specific purpose, generating a list of low PB, PE and think those at top list one good for investing, is a dangerous method and can easily fall into so called PE and PB trap."

Malaysia’s move to stub out tobacco use with higher levies has pushed smokers to the black market instead.
The Southeast Asian country has the world’s highest share of illegal tobacco sales at 59% of its market, with 1,000 illicit cigarettes bought each minute, Oxford Economics said in a report commissioned by British American Tobacco Plc.
That has cost the government 13.5 billion ringgit ($3.3 billion) of revenue in unpaid taxes since Malaysia raised excise duties on cigarettes in 2015, according to the report.
The finance ministry didn’t immediately respond to questions on the state revenue loss.
Malaysia has sought to curb smoking-related illnesses, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases, which are the main causes of premature death in the country, according to the health ministry.
About 22.8% of Malaysians aged 15 or older are smokers in 2015, a slight decline from 23.1% in 2011.
BAT’s Malaysian unit has long campaigned against excise increases by warning that it would worsen the illegal tobacco trade, which the company said is a key reason for its shrinking sales volume.
Its revenue fell 3.2% in 2018 on declining sales of cigarettes and contract manufacturing after it closed a factory near the capital Kuala Lumpur.
The company’s rival Japan Tobacco Inc. shuttered its Malaysian plant in 2017 and bought stakes in Indonesian and Philippine producers that same year.
The study commissioned by BAT showed about 598 million packs in Malaysia were illegal in 2018. Nearly half of the consumption were ""illicit whites” that are smuggled into the country from neighboring Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam due to cheaper prices.
Others include illegal ""kretek”, or clove cigarettes, and packs with fake tax stamps. - Bloomberg"

Theoretically ARBB-PA is worth RM0.15 when the mother share ARBB is trading at RM0.34.
PA price = RM0.34 - conversion price = RM0.34- RM0.19 = RM0.15.
Why isn't the price of ARBB-PA moving up to narrow the gap ya?
When it is in trading in the money means that mother share value is already higher then the exercise price (RM0.19).
Market typically will discount the mother value by some percentage when it is trading in money. Don't ask me why, but this is just the way it is. I can understand that there is a lag time of may be 1 to 2 weeks in converting to the mother share and therefore by the time you convert to the mother share, the market price of the mother share might have dropped by the time conversion is done.
However, in the case of ARBB, if the business is going to become better and better, the mother share price will trend upwards in the medium to long term. So there is little risk keep go up, so there is less risk of owing the PA as it will become more and more valuable with time.
Hope above explains."

Last Q19 report (n dividends) will be announced 4 weeks from now. Need to monitor that esp. the sales part to see how much it drop further. Note that earnings actually improved in 3Q vs 2Q.This was due to cost control measure but sales continued to decline.
If they can maintain sales at 3Q levels over 2020 then looking at 9+% dividends. If things improve, say enforcement becomes more effective, then there is a big upside. Of course, risk is that sales continue to deteriorate."

but if I don't sell, then it takes a dip and stuck there for years, then how?
for dividend stocks, it's no problem. For growth stocks, how do we handle this?"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=170","May 8, 2020 4:46 PM","Wellington Sky","For dividends stocks, once it go ex, the prices will drop. So in effect you are also selling out/take profit. Only in this case, you are forced to, not by choice. U can then use the dividends to spend, or invest in another stock with better risk/reward or reinvest in that stock again.
For pure capital gains, now you have a choice. Here, you are not forced to take profit. You sell it because you need the money or you see other better opportunities in terms of risk/reward.
For etf, say it has performed well but you are starting to get a bit nervous but at same time you are FOMO. You can first stop adding more money into it, and leave it be n monitor. If you are DCA type, then that already reduce ur risks.
If you get more nervous, then you can take some money off the table. You don't have to sell it all or even most.just a small %, as long as the transaction cost makes sense. Fund investors call this""rebalancing"". You can put the proceeds into another stock or etf.
In my case, I have price target. Hit target then it will be on watch list to sell, but I wont sell yet until it reach some sort of resistance. I will then sell some, most or all depending on the outlook as I see it."

PUTRAJAYA (Bernama): Wearing a face mask is strongly encouraged, especially in public and crowded areas, to reduce the risk of infection from Covid-19, says Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah.
""The Ministry of Health (MOH) encourages people to wear masks but at the moment, it is not compulsory,"" he told a daily press conference on Covid-19 here Monday (May 4).
In addition, Dr Noor Hisham reminded that other conditions must also be followed namely maintaining social distancing of at least one metre and observing good personal hygiene including frequent hand-washing.
""The MOH hopes that all Malaysians will adhere to the SOP (standard operating procedure),"" he said.
Asked on compliance by the public on the first day of the conditional movement control order (MCO), Dr Noor Hisham said it was too early to judge.
""But looking into the practice of other countries like in Taiwan or South Korea, they do not have MCO in place but they have social discipline and comply with the SOP.
""Now the SOP is clear and the MOH would like to urge all Malaysians to practise social distancing, put on a mask when in public and continue to wash hands from time to time,"" he said.
Dr Noor Hisham said the SOPs for the industries and restaurants were also clear and that compliance was very important to break the Covid-19 infection chain.
""If they can comply, we can break the infection chain, if not, there is a risk for our infectivity rate to increase from the current rate of 0.7 and this will be closely monitored,"" he said.
Asked on the ministry’s justification on the conditional MCO, which has been gazetted, Dr Noor Hisham said the strategy for MCO phase one, two and three was to flatten the curve by encouraging everyone to stay at home.
""MCO phase one, two and three and early part of four is to make sure the public stays at home, that is the message. Now the message to the public on conditional MCO is to follow the SOP,"""

I will explain to you why you should wear a mask:
1. Most countries that have a mask wearing culture seem to have much less infections.
2. It will protect others if you carry the virus with or without symptoms.
3. Any mask you wear may help reduce the viral load you are exposed to in the air especially in enclosed spaces.
4. It forces you psychologically to be more conscious of the virus pandemic and sort of reminds to to keep social distancing and hand hygiene.
5. The visual impact of others wearing also reminds you that its a ""new"" normal. It sort of acts like a ""badge"" of responsibility."

1. You are leaving your house. Put on the mask. And get in the car. - Its less likely you will forget to wear a mask on leaving the house.
2. In the car you continue wearing a mask for three reasons
a) You do not want to unnecessarily touch it with your hands once you have it on.
b) If you are at a road block and have to wind down your window you will protect yourself and the policeman by wearing a mask instead of forgetting or fumbling around to put it on.
c) If you take off the mask, you will have to put it somewhere in the car, potentially contaminating a surface in the car when the mask touches it.

I think he needs to just simply say that despite there being an absence of strong evidence for mask wearing, there is good empirical evidence that it could be a wise public health measure to stop the spread of the virus. Most countries that have a culture of mask wearing have less infections. Then go on to declare mask wearing in public as compulsory.

But covid-19 is a pandemic issue. The perception is one of fear of contracting the infection. That we know there were the Tabligh and import clusters and later foreigners. And the foreigners seem to be the unclear factor -not knowing when they are coming or where they are going or hiding. So they can be anywhere like the covid-19.

Mask is effective for protecting others but not the wearer from Covid-19 as it had been scientifically proven that the coronavirus transmission is through infected droplets emitted from the nostrils and mouth of a carrier. Asymptomatic and pre symptomatic carriers do not know that they are indeed carriers. A mask will limit the throw of droplets from an carrier thus making social distancing meaningful and effective. Any kind of fabric mask is far better than no mask. In fact, a mask from fabric is preferable as it could be reused after washing and drying.
Take a step back Datuk and please reconsider your stance.
Enforce this like how they do in Hong King, Singapore, China and Taiwan.
Make mask wearing outside one's home mandatory in our country and let's fight covid19 together effectively through science."

They think that the mask is for the wearer to protect himself and thus could be made optional.

However, such carriers are also infectious.

If you have an infection that can be spread by breathing then its a good idea to wear a mask, if you haven't its of no benefit whatsoever and may even cause damage. BMJ researchers notes masks can cause eye irritations which lead to people rubbing pathogens into their eyes; breathing difficulties that can increase the likelihood of contracting illness; they concentrate pathogens to the point where a infectious viral load can build up on the humid mask, and they distract from other more important measures like washing your hands and not touching escalator handrails in busy Malls.

The government's decision not to make the mask compulsory most likely is an economical one. Should it be compulsory for everyone to wear mask, our nation may have a massive mask shortage and the government cannot afford to give away masks or import/buy more mask to equip the nation for the next few months. The price at RM1.50 is already ludicrously expensive for the average working class Malaysian. Frontliners in hospitals and retail will have to wear new ones daily so overall the cost outweighs its advantage. In the end, sadly its always about the money not the health aspect."

Even global medical specialists differ in their views on the usage of masks. Fa recognises this difference when she says wearing of masks is compulsory in many, not all countries. Similarly, Sweden didn't want to impose a lockdown, neither did several other counties. Even among those that did, it was at varying levels.

So that the workers, legal and illegal, can be called back to work. There are more than two million of them, whose fate we can no longer ascertain. The recent raid on undocumented migrants is bringing us into the idea of what we wish to salvage as a nation. As a country still struggling to forge a better understanding amongst the Malays, Chinese, Indians, Orang Asli, Iban, Kadasan-Dusun, and others that have been here since before and after independence, as legal Malaysians. Then the undocumented migrants arrived. By the hundreds of thousands. The addiction of the owners of the means of production to profit immensely through the system of modern-day slavery. Now we have got a major problem of what to do with them, when our economy had just nose-dived, tanked! Millions of undocumented migrants hoping for jobs. Some 200,000 Rohingya refugees hoping for citizenship. Legal citizens hoping they will still have jobs. Graduates don't have a clue what awaits them. Government still thinking in the pre-Industry 4.0 paradigm. Chaotic thinking must be fixed. Now. Post-Covid-19, each country must take care of her own citizens. The world has changed. Nationalism is back in popular demand. We are all economic beings, tied to the dictates of citizenship. No jobs anymore for undocumented migrants and hopeful refugees. New reality. For Malaysia, having millions of undocumented migrants is not a good policy to develop her economy. Train the locals first. Fix our labour laws to meet the need of social regeneration and the goals of sustainability rather than think of making immense profits entirely.

We were supposed to talk about this “human sacrifice” the current government is engaging in. By opening up too soon, so that money can be made. So that the workers, legal and illegal, can be called back to work. There are more than two million of them, whose fate we can no longer ascertain. The recent raid on undocumented migrants is bringing us into the idea of what we wish to salvage as a nation. As a country still struggling to forge a better understanding amongst the Malays, Chinese, Indians, Orang Asli, Iban, Kadasan-Dusun, and others that have been here since before and after independence, as legal Malaysians. Then the undocumented migrants arrived. By the hundreds of thousands. The addiction of the owners of the means of production to profit immensely through the system of modern-day slavery. Now we have got a major problem of what to do with them, when our economy had just nose-dived, tanked! Millions of undocumented migrants hoping for jobs. Some 200,000 Rohingya refugees hoping for citizenship. Legal citizens hoping they will still have jobs. Graduates don't have a clue what awaits them. Government still thinking in the pre-Industry 4.0 paradigm. Chaotic thinking must be fixed. Now. Post-Covid-19, each country must take care of her own citizens. The world has changed. Nationalism is back in popular demand. We are all economic beings, tied to the dictates of citizenship. No jobs anymore for undocumented migrants and hopeful refugees. New reality. For Malaysia, having millions of undocumented migrants is not a good policy to develop her economy. Train the locals first. Fix our labour laws to meet the need of social regeneration and the goals of sustainability rather than think of making immense profits entirely. Herein lie the miseducation of the human rights activists, I sense. In conclusion, I am writing this article on the “human sacrifice” on a national scale, poorly planned by the current government. A rush job inviting fatalities. It is May 6. We will know of the casualties of this war by June 6. Perhaps. I hope we will not be another Italy. Or the US. In our haste to make money."

A bit like the racist diatribe against the Rohingya that was thankfully taken down by MKINI last week.
Probably happy at home, fully paid salary or steady gig income, treating the lockdown as a two month ""staycation""
Did you lose your job? Did your company close down? Were your savings wiped out? Are you a daily-wage earner with no income for two months? Are you looking after a family and children with no money? Are you a foreign worker on the run from the police because you're scared of deportation? Are you elderly locked at home alone? Are you locked in with an abusive partner every day in fear of your safety - your life? Are you OKU alone with no helpers?
This lockdown destroys people's livelihood and peace of mind. The people responsible are basically untouched or even benefit from the lockdown themselves. Arrogant and indifferent to the suffering they are causing - mostly to the poor and undefended.
They cause this devastation and then walk away leaving those most badly harmed to pick up the pieces alone - or stand in line at the pawn shop because they have no food to feed their children.
""Keep the lockdown at all costs"" - To take this lazy line of argument is to put no value on people's lives - because it shows no concern about the damage that is caused. This is the real value judgement - reflects very badly on your line of thought."

Understandably. The concept of nationalism is not easy to grasp. Many would want to just legalize immigrants quickly and attract more refugees. Until we become another Europe of today. The word ""xenophobia"" seems to be fashionably used these days. As in ""nationalism"" its use seems to signify one's level of sophistication, yet upon scrutiny of the political-economic as well as socio-psychological consequences of economic-refugee and humanly-trafficked migration, the meaning collapses. In addition, close and critical reading of an article is also necessary as a skill we impact on our students, especially. Mastery of it will enrich the reader's intellectual life. I hope these views help."

Your whole article had one good point. The opening up was not gradual enough. It was disorganized and disorderly, THAT agree. But the opening up HAD to occur, sooner rather than one or two months later as your article implies (or did it mean 6 months later . . . . .its vagueness as to when the ""right"" time was, did not help).
Where are you located exactly Sir? Did you not see our poor struggling with their daily needs and those on daily wages desperate to put food on the table? Did you not see the old struggling with the loneliness of the MCO and those living in crowded 400 sq ft low cost flats enduring the mental stress of having to stay indoors? Did you not see the 20,000 ordinary people who were arrested and some jailed for breaking the MCO?
You dare compare US and New York with Malaysia? In New York people arriving in Toyota Camry's and Ford Trucks to pick up free food. They were being given cash handouts very generously by Trump. We are a poor developing nation . . . . . we would struggle to feed our population for a prolonged MCO.
You are an academic with a poor grasp of simple health economics and epidemiology. Do you really think a continued lock down with not have any repercussions on the health of the population? Let me put it simply for you. As people become poor they starve and become malnourished. This in turn results in a poor immune status. It makes them prone to infections and diseases. Then they die because of it. Is that not also ""human sacrifice"" as you put it so crudely? Or is it all right because this involves the B40 group. Not those who live in ivory towers with cushy bank reserves. Are they not human too?
Then with an academic flourish, to add a bit of drama, you throw in ""child fatality"" into your script! Its well known in this pandemic that children don’t seem to be getting severely ill with Covid-19. I could only find 3 reported deaths in children in the US. Compare that to 4500 child deaths due to motor vehicle accidents yearly there. So please don""t ""sacrifice"" children by putting them in a car! To quote you, ""Think""!

PETALING JAYA: The asymptomatic spread of Covid-19 is not a good sign, says Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah (pic).
""Asymptomatic spread has not been good news thus far.
""A growing body of results shows that people who are asymptomatic appear to have the same viral load as symptomatic cases.
""This means that whether people have symptoms or not, they carry the same amount of virus inside them.
""This suggests that transmission is possible equally from both asymptomatic patients and noticeably sick patients,"" Dr Hisham said on his Facebook post on early Friday (May 15).
He was citing an article by Gigi Gronvall, an immunologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
Gronvall, in the article, had cited the case of Iceland, where a broad testing effort resulted in 5% of the country's population being tested for Covid-19, with a lab study suggesting that as many as 50% of people who had the disease showed no symptoms.
He noted that a study conducted in Singapore also showed this.
Gronvall added that because of the asymptomatic spread of the virus, a lot more testing had to be done and public health officials had to actively look for cases.
He said people would have to lead an altered way of life until there was a vaccine.
Dr Hisham said asymptomatic spread meant transmission would be more widespread.
""If you're able to transmit the virus while asymptomatic, it allows for a lot more community spread. It seems that Covid-19 is proving much harder to contain,"""

Other countries such as South Korea, Singapore, Australian and NZ have chosen the path to mass testing and they have been successful in identifying true community transmission and containing them. And yet our MOH has chosen the so called ""targeted"" testing which is quite useless in terms understanding true picture of communication transmission. Hence circulation of R value (reproduction value) is invalid because we have most likely underestimated the number ofCOVID-19 cases. The real scary issue is it only takes a few asymptotic carriers to cause a second or third wave.
MoH keeps talking about mass testing and I have not seen any evidence of mass testing. Look at the Worldometers stats today. Malaysia is doing 8,409 tests per million and Singapore is now at 38,372 tests per millions. Malaysia is doing 20% of what Singapore is doing in terms of testing.

The info of the symptomatic cases have been in the news for months now. That is the reason the many nations carry out mass testing. . To confine anybody that shows positive results.
Then why this advice of opening the economy and nation so soon, even after knowing this threat lurks among the people.
Is it to let the people celebrate the various festivals ? Are the politicians fear more about the dissatisfaction that may arise if they curb the celebrations ?
Is it that MOH knows that the numbers will pile up after this holidays. Then they will repeat the MCO and try and contain the second wave ?
Are the celebration more important that the danger the mixing of people will cause during this celebration ?
It looks that way."

I think while the threat was real, it has been complicated by the politics. Politicians found a golden opportunity to control people legally and legitimately. The politicians are getting addicted to this, control mechanism. Pray that they don’t drag this or in some countries there will be restrictions even after 10 years.

The latest coronavirus news updated every day including coronavirus cases, the latest news, features and interviews from New Scientist and essential information about the covid-19 pandemic
UK’s estimated coronavirus infection rate is now between 0.7 and 1
The UK’s coronavirus R value – the estimated number of people each person infects – is now between 0.7 and 1, according to the government’s scientific advisory group for emergencies (SAGE). Five days ago, UK prime minister Boris Johnson said R was between 0.5 and 0.9. The government’s science advisors say the increase is not a reflection of coronavirus restrictions being eased in England this week, but rather due to a lag in the data that is used to model the R value. We won’t know how easing restrictions has impacted the current R value for another three weeks.
Other coronavirus developments
Only 1500 of a total of 18,000 coronavirus contact tracers – just over 8 per cent – have been recruited by the UK government by its mid-May deadline, a cabinet minister said today. The government had previously refused to say exactly how many contact tracers it had employed.
Up to 8 million people could be on waiting lists for National Health Service (NHS) treatment by autumn, UK ministers heard yesterday. Hospital capacity could be cut by 30 per cent as trusts attempt to implement social distancing among staff and patients.
16 health unions have asked the UK government to provide rapid testing and adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) for doctors and nurses before the NHS reopens services that were cancelled during the covid-19 peak. This comes as evidence has emerged suggesting some doctors were pressured by NHS managers not to share their concerns about PPE.
US citizens should prepare to face the “darkest winter in modern history,” according to a whistleblower who was recently removed from his position as a government public health official. Rick Bright, who was ousted from his role leading a federal agency in charge of vaccine development in April, told a US congressional committee that the “window is closing to address this pandemic” and criticised the Trump administration’s lack of planning.
There have been no new covid-19 deaths announced in China for a month and only 91 patients are currently receiving treatment for the disease. 623 people are in isolation for suspected or confirmed coronavirus.
The first coronavirus cases have been detected in Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh. The densely populated camps are home to more than 1 million people, with an estimated 60,000 to 90,000 people per square kilometre living in small shelters.
Germany’s economy shrank by 2.2 per cent in the first quarter of this year, according to data released by the country’s federal statistics authority, the biggest contraction since the 2008 financial crisis.
Slovenia has become the first country in Europe to declare its coronavirus epidemic over, after daily new confirmed cases remained below seven for the last two weeks.
Restrictions to limit the spread of coronavirus were eased today in New South Wales, Australia, with pubs and clubs reopening.

As he approached the police roadblock, Hambali Mohamed got ready to dismount and open his delivery bag for inspection.
The Lalamove delivery rider would pass another two roadblocks on his delivery run in the capital of Kuala Lumpur.
Such restrictions are part and parcel of the daily life of delivery riders, who stand among the frontliners keeping the country safe and running amid the coronavirus pandemic.
From the inconvenient to the life-threatening, here are some of the challenges faced by delivery riders in getting food and packages to their customers during the ongoing lockdown.
Roadblocks have been a feature of Malaysia’s lockdown following the start of the nationwide movement control order (MCO) in mid-March.
But ever since a delivery rider found two packets of drugs packed in his customer’s food order, police in Malaysia have been running thorough checks on all deliveries at roadblocks.
This means delivery riders have to plan ahead to ensure they get the most out of their day.
Nurdhiya’aizat Othman, 30, who just started with GoGet, said even with a clearance letter from the authorities, roadblocks were slow going as there was no express lane for deliveries.
“Since I drive a car, each roadblock would set me back between 30 minutes to an hour,” said Nurdhiya’aizat, who also volunteers with the Malaysian Relief Agency.
“I buy groceries for customers, so I would head out to several wet markets by 6am and try to reach home before breaking fast (at 7.20pm). So, I’m on the road 12 hours a day.”
Some riders like Azizi Azni, 19 (below), prefer to keep to their immediate neighbourhood instead to minimise any encounters with roadblocks.
“I only work for a few hours and cater to orders close to home, so I don’t mind the wait,” said the aviation college student from Cheras, who starts deliveries after his online classes."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=178","May 18, 2020 11:14 AM","MoneyMaker168","Roadblocks aside, the weather remained a top concern for riders, with the frequent evening showers since last week complicating deliveries.
GrabFood rider Ashabal Hairi, 23, said there have been times when he has waited in the pouring rain because his customer was not aware that he’d arrived.
“We can’t take our phones out from the waterproof casing and we’ve honked numerous times. Until our calls are answered, we have no choice but to wait,” he said.
He added that braving the heat was one thing, but rain also posed a risk to safety and delays for those on a motorcycle.
The risks are real. Last week, Muhammad Zaim Azman, a 21-year-old Food Panda rider, died on the job after getting into a road accident in Meru near the port city of Klang.
More than 20 of his colleagues accompanied the hearse during its 80km journey from Klang Hospital to his grandmother’s house in Sekinchan to pay their last respects.
From side hustle to full-time job
But the job remains attractive to many, especially those who no longer have a steady source of income due to the strict restrictions on businesses operating during this period.
AirAsia X cabin crew Abdul Ghani Senari, 31 (below), started working as a Teleport delivery driver two weeks ago as passenger flights ground to a halt.
“I get about RM600 a week, enough to serve as pocket money throughout this MCO,” he said."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=178","May 18, 2020 11:14 AM","MoneyMaker168","Hambali, a waiter at the Putra World Trade Centre who earns RM2,000 a month, recently took a pay cut after the convention and exhibition centre closed. He has since been delivering full-time.
“I’ve been working part-time with Lalamove since last year and since I have nothing to do, going full-time is a great option to make ends meet,” said the 33-year-old, who now does deliveries from 10am to 5pm.
Before the lockdown, Hambali went back to his wife Nur Farahin Asmida’s hometown of Ipoh as they welcomed their third child, but he decided to return alone to their home in Cheras, Kuala Lumpur on March 31.
“Farahin sells cookies online and she makes enough profit for her personal spending. Since I have no one waiting at home for me, I figured I should do this and hopefully be able to make about RM4,000 a month.”
Delivery charges too high?
With roadblocks and delays at restaurants adding to delivery time, many riders have also struggled to manage customer expectations.
“We brave through the heat, rain, roadblocks, virus, all for the sake of customers. There’s always a valid reason for our tardiness,” said Ashabal, who hails from Hulu Klang.
While some sympathise with their predicament, others have been less understanding. Some have also complained about the delivery charge of about RM5 per order.
“Restaurants don’t provide chairs anymore for safety reasons so we have to stand while waiting for orders. Some orders are fast, while other times we have to stand and wait for an hour,” Ashabal said.
“Please put yourselves in our shoes. Not many would do this for RM5.”
Hambali said he sometimes travels 250km a day just doing deliveries around Kuala Lumpur.
“Today, for example, I’ve only delivered seven orders but I’ve travelled over 100km for this.”
Nurdhiya’aizat, who lives in Bukit Jalil, said his daily route includes travelling in his car (below) 30km all the way to Klang to cater to a single order."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=178","May 18, 2020 11:14 AM","MoneyMaker168","“I leave early because the other half of my day is for volunteer work, so some of my morning deliveries end in failure because my customers aren’t even up yet!”
Overcoming fear
Hambali said he understood the risk of always being outside during a pandemic, but it was something he had to do to provide for his family.
“I try to avoid running grocery orders to avoid contact as much as I can. Instead, I only pick up parcels or food that have already been packed and ready to go,” he said.
“As for Aidilfitri celebrations, I don’t think it’ll be the same as we’re used to. I don’t even know if I can go back to Ipoh to see my wife and children, especially our newborn.”
Ashabal pleaded with customers to learn more about contactless delivery options highlighted by the government and delivery companies.
“You can leave a chair outside so the riders can place your order there or if you have a low wall at the gate, leave a note for the riders to leave it there,” he said.
He said he’d never really thought of delivery riders as frontliners, but it meant a lot to him to see the gratitude shown by his customers and their reminders to stay safe.
“All my life, I don’t think I’ve given anything to my country, but today I’m proud to do something meaningful for Malaysians.”"

There have been 317 children aged 12 and below who have been infected with Covid-19.
Data released by the Health Ministry shows that 46 percent, of 147 children infected were six-years-old or younger.
Selangor has the highest recorded cases among children, with 77 infections, followed by Negri Sembilan (48), and Johor (46).
The ministry's director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah (photo) said no deaths among children have been reported so far, nor have there been any severe cases.
However, he said infants and children are at a higher risk of getting infected with Covid-19, as are the elderly.
These infections are likely to be transmitted by adults and other family members, he said.
""We are exposed to the virus through the community. Every time we come home, we bring home the virus, and we can infect the elderly and children.
""This is why during the festive season, the Health Ministry is worried that we can bring the virus back to our kampungs, and infect the elderly and children,"" he said at a press conference in Putrajaya today.
Noor Hisham said besides affecting the lungs, children infected with Covid-19 are at risk of developing ""Kawasaki disease"", which causes inflammation of the blood vessels.
He said adults returning from outside to their homes must take precautions, such as taking a bath first or sanitising their hands before interacting with children.
He said parents and caretakers must also educate children about the importance of washing their hands, keeping clean, and always wearing their face masks in public, especially in crowded areas.
Previously, Defence Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob had warned parents against bringing their children to shopping malls."

It is not possible to wear a mask at all times as it is uncomfortable .
So the instruction for wearing a face mask is when it is impossible to social distance more than 1-2 metre . Use your wisdom and wear the mask when it appears you may be at risk .
Social distancing , the more the better and strict hand hygiene is important
The focus on the groups likely to cause resurgence of clusters is welcomed which is immediate lockdown of red zones anywhere .. Quick action to contain clusters and test contacts is needed to inform the contacts to take extra precautions not to spread the virus in the asymptomatic phase or mildly symptomatic phase . However those contracting Covid 19 should be treated as having a dangerous flu and not leprosy.
The illegals will be need to rounded up and tested and migrant workers dormitories etc should be ugraded to be more sanitary and clean .
Many illegals are in hiding in overcrowded accommodations and hopefully with no new illegals the disease will be burn out when most of them have had Covid19
The most important thing is to remember that with all the above precautions the young and healthy could still get covid 19 in a mild dose and get immunity and get well with minimal symptoms and not worry about this .
The Ministry is knowing to have excellent publicity on the importance of these young not giving it to the elderly and vulnerable who will get the lung infection and need oxygen and ventilation or die .. Those going to work must also it appears protect children not only the elderly by SOP practices at home as well when tending to the elderly and children.
Overall the country has done well but now it is time not to be afraid to lift as many restrictions with the following rules being applied strictly
1. Wear a 3 ply surgical mask which is now cheap mandatory when you are unable to social distance more than 1meter and this should be enforced by designated personnel wherever this is occurring eg inside crowded LRT , in JPJ
post offices etc etc. .
2 . Social distancing as far as possible whenever one can
3 . Strict soap hand washing after going to public places and touching public things .
Strict toilet hygiene
4. Regular sterilization of common areas .
5. Use your common sense to protect the elderly and those with chronic illness etc and also young children at home and at schools by the working adults going into the community to make a living .
6. PPE such as N95 and facial shield for healthcare workers or others who could be exposed to direct high levels of the virus and doing screening etc. Patients are presenting in OP patient clinics not necessarily with fever and cough but gastrointestinal symptoms, conjunctivitis , heart related symptoms etc.
3 ply facemasks for all other healthcare workers who can distance themselves and not directly examining patients .
Honestly it is the number of those needing oxygen and ventilation and number of deaths and children developing a Kawasaki like illness being kept low at this moment in time and not the number of Covid 19 cases as this is like saying we want the number of flu cases in the country to be in two digits or single digits .
Everything should be reopened but following set SOPS at each level . I think most rakyat understand how serious this Covid 19 is to the vulnerable population and all of us citizens can point out any SOP not being followed by 5% of offenders to managesr , proprietors or officials in charge to put them on their toes to ensure SOP is being followed.
I think the issue on wearing a mask is still very confusing from KKM so why not just say if you CANT social distance more than 1 meter please wear a mask eg in crowded or poor ventilation areas like public transport , JPJ etc etc.
Keep up the great work KKM but its time to reopen everything as Covid 19 cases will never decrease to zero and new clusters will need to identified and dealt with speedily and SOPs at all levels should be followed by all citizens who by now are quite well educated and 95% compliant and for the 5% non compliant officials in each place should enforce compliance as they have the right to do so."

There is no point in sharing experience or pointing out fraud as good intent is misconstrued as sour grapes. Indeed, I am not an investor in ARBB or AGESON, I never will b as I am not interested to fall for a syndicated pump & dump. All shares I invest in are strong financially supported companies. My comments are open 4 all 2 cross check & verify. Similarly 2 those who invested in Ageson. Well, this is wat speculative mania + greed + toxic misleading material + fraudulent announcement looks like first hand up close.
My only 2 questions yet not a single person who criticise me was able to answer until now?
1. Please explain how does a company has large receivables, report strong profit quarter after quarter but no matching cash amount enters the books of the company?
2. How one company, signs an MOU non-legally binding, announced it, push the share price up, then announced cancellation less than 6 months later multiple times, and share price plunge, yet there are still people who wants 2 put money in tis company?
Tis is not Ageson forum but since its same shareholder and same modus operandi, I will reiterate this. Ageson LOI is bogus & fraud, the govt has came out to dispute. Sea sand is not allowed for export, only river sand. And indeed Polo the company one of the few company with the AP by govt is allowed because it belongs 2 VVIP, but even Polo cannot export sea sand, only river sand. This is the law of the country. Refer to this report.
https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2019/07/04/no-sea-sand-export-...
Now if it is a RM 27 Billion contract, y do the contracting party not sign a direct contract with Polo but have 2 go thru Ageson that does not have an AP or capability or experience? If u argue, must be thru listed co and Polo isn’t listed, then buyer can easily signed with WZ Satu which is related 2 VVIP. Feel free 2 have intellectual discourse on tis, don’t be an uncultured savage 2 hurl insults and abuse if can argue logically. Lastly, I believe a huge number of those criticisms r from d syndicates keyboard warrior.
TIme will tell. I wish every1 who invested in ARBB, all the v best 2 u"

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=181","May 19, 2020 1:47 PM","WellingtonSky","To cut to the jugular, Tommy Thomas, former attorney-general, a Tan Sri, has described the MACC statement that he had agreed to a settlement of the case against Riza Aziz as a lie.
And when the MACC head Azam Baki further stated that he stood by his deputy public prosecutor (DPP) source of information, it can be inferred that Thomas is calling Azam a liar.
We can now expect the MACC chief to repair this affront by instituting legal proceedings against Thomas for defamation of character. Or would he?
Weighing the chronological history of events prior to Thomas’ departure and in particular the complaint by Riza’s own counsel, there are essentially only two issues in this shocking case.
The first is the identity of the person who authorised the withdrawal of the charges and second, the terms under which the settlement was achieved.
Examining the second point first, it appears that by payment of about US$107 million, Riza would not face further action in respect of the US$248 million, which is the subject of the claims against him.
Even the least mind would conclude that such generous conditions would mean that for certain individuals, crime apparently indeed pays. This would hardly be shocking since Malaysians already suffer the perception that some can get away with murder even in its literal sense.
What is truly outrageous is that where a person has supposedly come to possess RM1 billion through dubious means, he is still allowed to retain RM500 million, a most profitable undertaking.
Along the sidelines, people may also wonder why, if someone had taken home properly earned income, he would not want to surrender even a sen of it to the government.
This brings us to the first point. Considering the noxious elements in the case, there is a high stink of shame and condemnation against whoever was behind the convenient arrangement; this could also be an impediment to the many other instances where similar settlement is eagerly awaited.
Thus, what better solution than to set a false trail and lay blame on an innocent passer-by. Tommy Thomas fits the role to a T, and he can always be accused of not sharing the national vision of race, religion, and ruler.
He might even be a closet DAP supporter."

Johor Police today reminded the public not to waste time applying for the interstate travel permit for the purpose of ‘balik kampung’ to celebrate Aidilfitri.
Johor police chief Datuk Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay (pix) said the permission for interstate travel will only be given for emergency cases.
He added the police received between 1,000 to 1,500 applications daily from the public over the past few days, requesting for interstate travel with 70 per cent of them wanting to return to their hometowns to celebrate Aidilfitri.
“About 70 per cent of the application were from those wanting to return to their hometowns to celebrate Aidilfitri and they were rejected. We only allow interstate travel for emergency cases only.
“As such, please do not waste your time applying if the reason for interstate travel was only for celebrating Aidilfitri,” he said in a press conference at the Johor police contingent headquarters.
He also advised the public not to be stubborn by taking advantage of the Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) to return to their respective hometowns.
“If they were still stubborn, they will be instructed to turn around at the state exit. There are still 33 roadblocks at several exits across the state borders including at the highway and state roads or villages. Those traveling without an authorisation letter will be asked to turn back,” he added"

Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) vice-chancellor Prof Dr Mohd Hamdi Abd Shukor said the delivery method for the students had to be innovated to be more state-of-the art and not just one-way.
The teaching content should be tailored to the needs of industry and society. These two things if combined, will turn out different graduates who will become the choice of the industry, ”he said when speaking as a guest on the Bernama TV’s ‘Ruang Bicara’ programme here today.
Mohd Hamdi did not deny that the issue of unemployment among UA graduates, who found it difficult to find a job, might be partly due to study programmes which were lacking in commercial values to employers.
However, there are some programmes that need to be continued for the benefit of the race and the nation, he said.
Meanwhile, Mohd Hamdi also congratulated all UKM staff on its 50th Golden Jubilee celebration yesterday.
“In conjunction with the 50th year, I offer my congratulations and hope that the over 200,000 alumni will support this university.
""For the manpower, staff and students, let us work hard to make UKM a true world class university by 2025 and I believe UKM is on the right track to achieve that target,’’ he added.

I will argue that the employer is doing skill matching very well. It is the difference in the quality of the graduate that is the fundamental issue.
We do have employers in Malaysia that are expecting and willing to train them. For those, our uni system failed to be a measure of supplying graduates that can be trained. This expose a even more fundamental problem with our system: the quality of graduates is not uniform even within the same university and the same course.
Our uni had adopted the American system where quality are not uniform and where you graduated from is a big factor on your ability. Employer caught on this and is reacting accordingly. This is not a problem. The problem is graduates are still being fed the fairy tale that we are still using the old British system where being a uni grad means you achieved a minimum and high standard of skills compared to those who don't. This translates to expectations that are no longer realistic. Under these circumstances a portion of graduates are going to be disappointed when they find that reality bites after graduation.
This is skewed even worse by years of quota system that got out of control, creating the situation where graduates from the same uni and the same course are treated very differently because of the difference in perceived ability of the graduates. It makes it even more difficult for students and parents to accept the reality of the cut throat nature of the workplace. You can argue that is it any university that fails to raise up the less able students, but society at large will tell you that the more fundamental problem lies in your selection of students.
This problem we have today benefits no one, and is reflected everyday on our life and our universities' standing in world rankings."

If you want to feed the needs of industry then create a separate polytechnic stream of education to produce technologists
Universities are SUPPOSED to serve an innovative and creative role in society.
They should not be degree factories.
Although, looking at the Malaysian tertiary education system the primary role of a university has been swallowed up by the need to accredit the failures of a failed society
BTW, in a real university, the delivery method is immaterial, because the students should be mature enough and innovative enough to source their own information

Trucks were seen entering the guarded area earlier Wednesday (May 20).
Immigration Department director-general Datuk Khairul Dzaimee Daud, who was at the scene then, said that as at noon, around 200 have been detained.
“The estimated number of people detained for now is around 200, made up of Indonesian, Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani nationals.
“All that have been brought from enhanced MCO areas are already quarantined and have been checked by the Health Ministry.
“They are confirmed negative from Covid-19. No risk for them to be brought to our depots, ” he said.
Khairul added that the welfare of the detained illegal immigrants was ensured.
“Their welfare will be taken care of, including medicine and food. Throughout their time in the depot, the process of deportation will proceed, ” he said.
Similar raids were carried out at the Kuala Lumpur Wholesale Market on May 11.
Parts of Old Town have been put under enhanced MCO since May 10 after the authorities found 26 Covid-19 positive cases there."

All these illegal immigration started a long time ago due to inconsistent government policies that in the beginning, was done largely to tilt the vote banks (refer to Sabah in 1990s). Then the Ministry that the late Megat Junid headed, found that it could be a lucrative personal venture as well through the monopolisation of agency recruitment both abroad and at home. From that point on, it started getting out of control and the immigration Department got into the act as well. We need to have a total immigration labour reform. There is no problem legalising it and I think everyone in Malaysia knows we are now dependent on foreign labour and have to accept them as part of our society. But it needs proper regulation and policies. And then the transparent enforcement can set in. At the moment, we are subject to scrupulous middle men, agents, smugglers, government officers, enforcement people, crony contracts (even the medical screening of foreign labour is ‘privatised”), snake heads at both ends.....it is a total MESS"

2. Cleanup operation follows a week or two but the momentum decreases every other day.
3. A few hundreds illegals out of the millions nabbed
4. Immigrants legal and non legals go into hiding
5. Detention centers moans of packed detainees.
6. Employers began to cry that locals are lazy and they need foreign workers
7. Government retracts operation in just under a month
8. Some unlucky immigrants deported others whitewashed as legals.
9. Employers and syndicates began their operation until the next outburst from rakyat (read Malays)
The following steps repeat itself"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=184","May 20, 2020 1:49 PM","alipay88","PUTRAJAYA: Thirty-seven new COVID-19 cases were reported in Malaysia on Tuesday (May 19), bringing the country's total to 6,978 cases, including 1,218 which are active, said Health Ministry director-general Noor Hisham Abdullah.
""Two of the 37 new confirmed patients are imported cases while 35 are local transmissions, 22 of whom are foreigners,” he told a daily news conference.
Thirty-one patients had recovered and were discharged on Tuesday, said Dr Noor Hisham, bringing the cumulative figure for recoveries to 5,646, or 80.9 per cent of the total number of positive cases.
One more fatality was reported, bringing the death toll to 114, or 1.63 per cent of the total number of cases.
The latest fatality was Case 6,942, a 77-year-old Malaysian woman with a history of diabetes, high blood pressure and liver cancer who was admitted to a medical centre in Pahang. She was confirmed to have died at 3.09am on Monday.
Dr Noor Hisham said 11 people were still being treated in intensive care, including six who require ventilator support.
The official was also asked about standard operating procedures for shopping centres during the country's coming festivals.
Dr Noor Hisham expressed concern that some people were still taking the matter lightly and openly violating guidelines.
""We should be reminded that although the number of reported COVID-19 cases is dropping, the threat of infection still exists in the community,"" he said. ""Therefore, we should protect ourselves, our family and the community from COVID-19 infection.""
He also advised people to avoid shopping in crowded and cramped places where social distancing is difficult to practise."

Stop hoodwinking us with exaggerated deaths which are actually from other causes."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=184","May 20, 2020 1:58 PM","FancyMe","We all hope it stays down. We have to wait till 1 month after full lifting of MCO with SOPs in place. If during that period we can keep our numbers down than we can say we are in control.
Full lifting of MCO is when the schools open, all businesses are back to normal and travel restrictions are lifted. This probably is going to take sometime.
The other important criteria will be the status of other countries. So for now we have to get the message across that we have to be diligent on our social practices, especially living with lots of caution. All this comes down with sacrifices, patience and most important acceptance that life is going to be challenging for many.
To get through this depends very much on the socio-economic well being of the people. It needs a lot of effort to keep people a little happy. How do we keep people mentally ready for this? It is going to take a lot. Now is the time to activate this part of the action going. This is not even the post pandemic phase yet. Are the nation and its leaders ready for this? Looking at things not so. Why, because there is too much political bickering, instead of full focus on getting out of the most pressing issue.
The very fact that full parliamentary democracy is not seen to be happening is of a big set back. This means the Ministers have nobody to answer to. Zero accountability and just having a laid back life, till things get back to ""normal"". All current issues and decisions are managed by the various ministerial heads. However these heads have limited power. On the other hand how much expertise or creative ideas to manage the current situation is again questionable, despite being in these departments for years.
Everything is a collective and inter dependent effort and approach. With the present mind set and looking at the overall picture it is not up to the mark.
So looking at just numbers can be deceiving. I do understand that gov duty is to achieve that and have done well so far."

The suspicion is usual patients with known chronic diseases and normal flu cases are lumped as C-19. Whatever it is, the handling is absurd at global level.

It is silly. If it is your time to kick the bucket no mask, hiding distancing or doctor can save you.

I notice you commenting about the special dividend of more than 40cents. There are 300 million shares in the market. If it is as you say 40 cents then the total dividend amount would be 120 million. Looking at the balance sheet, the company has about 23 million in cash and bank balances. Something doesn't add up. How does the company fork out that extra 100 million ringgit? That is not including devaluing the price of the share to literally 0 if the 40 cents of dividend per share is proposed as of current share price.

Nasi Lemak Recipe
Nasi lemak - Malaysian coconut milk rice, served with sambal, fried crispy anchovies, toasted peanuts and cucumber. This is the best and most authentic nasi lemak recipe.
Prep Time: 30 minutes
Cook Time: 30 minutes
Total Time: 1 hour
Ingredients:
coconut milk steamed rice
2 cups rice
3 screwpine (pandan) leaves, tie them into a knot as shown above
salt to taste
1 can coconut milk (5.6 oz)
some water
Tamarind Juice
1 cup water
tamarind pulp, size of a small ping pong ball
Sambal Ikan Bilis (Dried Anchovies Sambal)
1/2 red onion
1 cup ikan bilis, dried anchovies
1 clove garlic
4 shallots
10 dried chillies
1 teaspoon belacan, prawn paste
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
Other ingredients
2 hard boiled eggs, cut into half
3 small fish, sardines or smelt fish
1 small cucumber, cut into slices and then quartered
Instructions
Just like making steamed rice, rinse your rice and drain. Add the coconut milk, a pinch of salt, and some water. Add the pandan leaves into the rice and cook your rice.
Rinse the dried anchovies and drain the water. Fry the anchovies until they turn light brown and put aside.
Pound the prawn paste together with shallots, garlic, and de-seed dried chilies with a mortar and pestle. You can also grind them with a food processor. Slice the red onion into rings. Soak the tamarind pulp in water for 15 minutes. Squeeze the tamarind constantly to extract the flavor into the water. Drain the pulp and save the tamarind juice.
Heat some oil in a pan and fry the spice paste until fragrant. Add in the onion rings. Add in the ikan bilis and stir well. Add tamarind juice, salt, and sugar. Simmer on low heat until the gravy thickens. Set aside.
Clean the small fish, cut them into half and season with salt. Deep fry. Cut the cucumber into slices and then quartered into four small pieces. Dish up the steamed coconut milk rice and pour some sambal ikan bilis on top of the rice. Serve with fried fish, cucumber slices, and hard-boiled eggs."

At this juncture, US President Donald Trump should own up and focus on tackling the pandemic which is taking a toll on his country. He should know that a head start of at least two months has been squandered since the existence of the virus was made known to the world late last year.
Trump said on Feb 29 that Washington was ready to help Iran fight the virus if its leaders requested it. The fact that he could offer the aid at that time obviously means Trump had the situation under control but apparently acted too late for his country.
If he still thinks that the head start was not enough, then think of China. It started from zero."

However, I have to agree with him that WHO (Worthless Health Organisation) has directly contributed to this global disaster.
The fundamental objective of WHO has to be global public health. If WHO is not putting public health as its number 1 priority, then why do you need WHO in the first place? There are plenty of other trade-focused organisations in the world which are advocates for trade and commerce.
It is a matter of public record that WHO continued to ask countries not to close borders even after the Chinese government has officially notified WHO that human-to-human transmission of Covid-19 is possible in January. In fact, there has been evidence of human-to-human transmission as early as November in China.
Regardless of which side of the political divide you are in, the bottom line is WHO fails in its fundamental responsibility."

They have done a lot within their remit to spread information to states as fast as possible and dispense balanced advice, and most of all, they are subject to public scrutiny for the advice.
1. WHO runs on a scientific basis and in January warned of human-to-human transmissions, yet the US did not do much to prepare. Do you think if they advised border closures, the US would have taken heed?
2. There was plentiful evidence that closing borders selectively may not be effective as there are many routes for disease vectors to enter.
3. The economy is related to health. Manufacturing is vital to keep supplies running, and logistics is vital to ensure those supplies get where they need to be.
Here's a statement from WHO:
""Here, I ask your governments to seriously consider and reconsider steps taken to close borders and impose import/export restrictions. These measures are inhibiting the flow of desperately needed supplies and equipment, including personal protective equipment for our frontline health workforce. This is directly impacting the ability of health systems to prepare and respond.""
Newday: It was interesting listening to Trump’s speech. He accused WHO of working with the Chinese to prevent much-needed medical information early on coming out to the rest of the world.
The Chinese refused WHO’s repeated requests to release live virus strains to WHO to distribute to research facilities, they relented part way by releasing the DNA sequence but that was it. China also refused repeated WHO requests to send people to China for some time.
Does that read like WHO in cahoots with the Chinese? This is all about Trump shoring up his rabid right-wing nutter supporter base.
Any rational person would have saved their view on this until after the worst of Covid-19 is over, not in the middle of this crisis. Yes, WHO could have done a better job by calling the pandemic earlier, but look at certain presidents - US and Brazil - repeatedly ignored the truth and still do.
With the benefit of hindsight, everyone could have done better."

Pompeo rejected Chinese President Xi Jinping’s claim that Beijing had acted with transparency after the outbreak in China, and said if Xi wanted to show that, he should hold a news conference and allow reporters to ask him anything they liked.
“President Xi claimed this week that China is acting with openness, transparency responsibility. I wish it were so,” Pompeo told a State Department news conference, charging that Beijing continued to withhold virus samples and access to facilities, to censor discussion, “and much, much more.”
US-China tensions have spiked in recent weeks, with Pompeo and President Donald Trump slamming Beijing’s handling of the outbreak.
The US has been hardest hit in the global pandemic.
At a time when many nations worldwide are urging for unity and cooperation to ramp up the fight against the virus, Trump has proposed quitting the World Health Organization over its response and called it a “puppet of China,” while Xi has pledged it US$2 billion.
“I look forward to seeing them fulfil that US$2 billion commitment,” Pompeo said.
“China’s contributions to fighting the pandemic are paltry compared to the cost that they have imposed on the world.
“This plague has cost roughly 90,000 American lives more than 36 million Americans have lost their jobs since March; globally 300,000 lives.
“Cost of pandemic could be as much as US$9 trillion, according to our estimates, cost imposition on the world of the Chinese Communist Party’s failures.”
He accused China of threatening Australia with “economic retribution” for seeking an independent inquiry into the outbreak’s origins and charged that WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had had “unusually close ties to Beijing … long before this current pandemic,” something “deeply troubling.”
The WHO and the Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Pompeo’s accusations."

Strangely, you state that the relax-decision was reached after consultations among the Finance Ministry, International Trade and Industry Ministry, Bank Negara and Khazanah Nasional Berhad.
You did not mention the Health Ministry. Perhaps you hold that when it comes to the nation’s health, the Health Ministry is not relevant.
And to further support your stand, Azmin, you quote brayings from the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers and the Malay Chamber of Commerce.

Bank Negara could have informed the government last week on the situation on the SRF Fund hence this sudden and hasty action by the government on May 1. If it is a well-thought-out decision as what the government says, it would not have been just a three-day notice to Malaysians.

Legal action? What legal action? Businesses suing the respective state governments on the ground of loss of profit because they (respective states) tighten health control to protect the rakyat?
On the other hand, his political arch-rival Ismail Sabri Yaakob had earlier said each state could tighten the standard of control by delaying or tighten the control for the safety of the rakyat in their respective states.

If it was the latter, why did Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced a further two-week extension previously only to then announced on May 1 that it was cut short by one week? It would seem that decision-making in government is haphazard.
If you wanted to open up, a longer advance notice should have been given for preparations and the number of new cases should have fallen to single digits. News of rising numbers in Singapore and reports of new infections in Japan and Germany after the easing of restrictions have raised concern amongst the state governments and public.
The SOPs (standard operating procedures) have been issued late to make any meaningful preparations easy for opening. The government has failed to consult the public, a majority of whom are concerned about the supposed flattened curve which does not seem to be flattened enough.
Perikatan Nasional (PN) should be more efficient in decision-making and more transparent before accusing state governments of non-cooperation."

He also said: “Hence, the state governments are urged to co-operate in executing the federal government’s decision to regenerate the economy.”
Isn’t the main aim of gazetting the CMCO supposed to be to prevent and control infectious diseases? So shouldn’t decisions be made based on the advice of the Health Ministry and experts from the infectious disease field?
But it looks like decisions are made more to pander to the whims and fancies of industry players rather than for prevention and control of infectious diseases.
Don’t get me wrong. I am for the economy to regenerate. But it shouldn’t be done at the expense of the health safety of our rakyat.
Industries should be allowed time to adjust working environments to comply to prevention and control of infectious diseases. A one-week notice for the industries to reopen would be nice. So May 12 should be a good time to reopen.
Some states have “defied” the order of the federal government but I don’t think they do it with any negative intention. After all, hadn’t they fully cooperated with the federal government during the first three MCOs?
It was because they knew that it was good for their states. For this CMCO, they certainly can foresee problems arising should they follow the federal government’s decision.
Though all states have been struck with the Covid-19 problem, we have to understand that they are not similarly struck. So how can we have one blanket decision for all states?"

The state governments may have their own concerns which are equally legitimate, and they are well entitled within their own jurisdiction to determine what, when and how businesses should re-open.
What Malaysian businesses want is for the federal government to provide leadership, to plan, pre-empt, instead of coming up with such last-minute decisions.
Just because the decision has finally and belatedly made, does not mean everybody needs to go back to work all at once. In fact, that might well be reckless.
You should go and advise the backdoor PM to convene a full parliamentary session. Don't wait for relief laws and measures to be debated in July.
Debate now so that Attorney-General’s Chambers (AGC) can help draft it for passage in July. If you only wait until July, where is the public consultation and engagement?

The action comes after years of criticism that social media companies have allowed the president to push misinformation unchecked"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=190","May 27, 2020 1:41 PM","MoneyMaker168","Twitter on Tuesday slapped a fact-check label on President Trump’s tweets for the first time, a response to long-standing criticism that the company is too hands-off when it comes to policing misinformation and falsehoods from world leaders.
The move, which escalates tensions between Washington and Silicon Valley in an election year, was made in response to two Trump tweets over the past 24 hours. The tweets falsely claimed that mail-in ballots are fraudulent. Twitter’s label says, “Get the facts about mail-in ballots,” and redirects users to news articles about Trump’s unsubstantiated claim."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=190","May 27, 2020 1:41 PM","MoneyMaker168","The tweets, said Twitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough, “contain potentially misleading information about voting processes and have been labeled to provide additional context around mail-in ballots.”"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=190","May 27, 2020 1:42 PM","MoneyMaker168","The label directs users to articles by CNN, The Washington Post and the Hill, along with selections from the articles and a page summarizing the findings of fact-checkers.
Twitter’s action quickly drew backlash from Trump and his supporters. Twitter “is now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election,” the president tweeted. “They are saying my statement on Mail-In Ballots, which will lead to massive corruption and fraud, is incorrect, based on fact-checking by Fake News CNN and the Amazon Washington Post.”
For its 14-year existence, Twitter has allowed misinformation by world leaders and everyday citizens to spread virtually unchecked. Its leaders have long said users would engage in debate on the platform and correct false information on their own.
But Trump has made many false claims on social media, particularly on his preferred medium of Twitter, and has also attacked people in ways that critics have argued could violate company policies on harassment and bullying."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=190","May 27, 2020 1:44 PM","MoneyMaker168","For example, Twitter faced a barrage of criticism earlier Tuesday over another set of Trump tweets. The widower of a former staffer to then-Rep. Joe Scarborough asked Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey to delete tweets by Trump furthering a baseless conspiracy theory about the staffer’s wife’s death. Those tweets are still up, a reflection of social media companies’ approach to policing content that can appear inconsistent even as they have stepped up their enforcement.
Twitter is debating whether to take action on the Scarborough tweets, said a person familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.
Widower of Joe Scarborough staffer seeks removal of Trump tweets that promote baseless conspiracy theory
Its much larger rival Facebook, by contrast, launched a fact-checking program several years ago. Facebook funds an army of third-party fact-checkers to investigate content, which then gets labeled on the site and demoted in its reach. However, Trump posted the same content about mail-in ballots on Facebook.
Facebook said it didn’t plan to label or remove the post. “We believe that people should be able to have a robust debate about the electoral process, which is why we have crafted our policies to focus on misrepresentations that would interfere with the vote,” Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone said.
Twitter, which has roughly 330 million users compared to Facebook’s 2.6 billion, has not had the resources or the institutional will to engage fact-checkers.
But Twitter has changed its approach during the pandemic. In March, the company revised its terms of service to say it would remove posts by anyone, even world leaders, if such posts went “against guidance from authoritative sources of global and public health information.” That includes comments claiming social distancing is ineffective or essential oils can be used to cure the disease, for example.
Soon after, for the first time, Twitter applied the policy to world leaders, removing tweets by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, arguing that the tweets about breaking social distancing orders and touting false cures had such potential for harm that labeling them would be insufficient.
In March, Twitter labeled a manipulated video of presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden that was retweeted by Trump. That same month, Facebook took down a misleading ad about the U.S. census, one of two times that Facebook has taken action against the Trump campaign.
Then earlier this month, Twitter rolled out a policy saying that it would label or provide warning messages about corona virus related misinformation, even when that information is not a direct contradiction of health authorities and does not violate the company’s policies. The company said at the time that it may expand the labels risk of harm. Tuesday’s tweets on elections represent an expansion into a new area of election-related misinformation.
“It’s clear that social networking sites have a critical role to play in disseminating democratic speech and therefore in helping to police the boundaries of that speech,"" said Joshua Pasek, an associate professor of communication and media at the University of Michigan. ""The fact that Twitter felt the need to take this action suggests that there is a point at which the preservation of democracy in their view overshadows the importance of remaining non-partisan.”
As a matter of policy, Twitter and other tech companies hold world leaders to different standards than everyday users. The content of world leaders is kept up by Facebook, Twitter and Google’s YouTube, even when it violates company policies, a practice known as the “newsworthiness exemption.”
That policy has long been subject to criticism because comments by world leaders can have massive impacts on people’s behavior and the potential to cause harm. Trump’s recent promotion of the drug hydroxychloroquine as an experimental treatment for the novel coronavirus, for example, caused prescriptions and sales to soar.
If Trump had instructed people to take the drug outright, the statement would probably have been taken down by both Facebook and Twitter, according to people who work there who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Instead the president walked a fine line, promoting the benefits of the drug and saying he was taking it himself.
The World Health Organization has halted studies of the drug out of concern that it causes more harm than good."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong deployed riot police around the Legislative Council on Wednesday as activists called for protests against a bill to criminalise disrespect of the Chinese anthem, amid soaring tensions over perceived threats to the city’s freedoms."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=191","May 27, 2020 1:57 PM","WellingtonSky","Protests have returned to the streets of Chinese-ruled Hong Kong after Beijing proposed national security laws last week that sparked global fears that the freedoms helping it prosper as an interface between China and the West could be eroded.
Hundreds of riot police took up positions and authorities erected a two-metre (6 feet) wall made of plastic barriers filled with water around the Legislative Council, extending across a park up to Victoria Harbour.
In other parts of the city, protesters used bins and debris to block roads, while activists issued calls online for demonstrations in various locations later in the day.
“Although you’re afraid inside your heart, you need to speak out,” said Chang, 29, a clerk and protester dressed in black with a helmet respirator and goggles in her backpack."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=191","May 27, 2020 1:57 PM","WellingtonSky","Police said they had arrested at least 16 people, aged 14-40, involved in crimes including possession of offensive weapons, possession of tools for illegal use and dangerous driving.
Protesters in a downtown shopping mall chanted “Liberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our times” and “Hong Kong independence, the only way out”, but dispersed as lookouts shouted a warning to “go shopping!” at the sight of police vans outside.
One protester was seen with a placard reading “one country, two systems is a lie”, referring to the political system put in place at Britain’s 1997 handover of the city to China that is meant to guarantee Hong Kong’s freedoms until at least 2047.
“I’m scared ... if you don’t come out today, you’ll never be able to come out. This is legislation that directly affects us,” said Ryan Tsang, a hotel manager.
Beijing last week unveiled national security legislation plans for Hong Kong that aims to tackle secession, subversion and terrorist activities.
It could see Chinese intelligence agencies set up bases in the semi-autonomous city.
The move triggered the first big street unrest in Hong Kong in months on Sunday, with police firing tear gas and water cannon to disperse protesters, evoking memories of violent anti-government protests that paralysed parts of the city last year.
Chinese authorities and the Beijing-backed government in Hong Kong say there is no threat to the city’s high degree of autonomy and the laws will be tightly focused.
“It’s for the long term stability of Hong Kong and China, it won’t affect the freedom of assembly and speech and it won’t affect the city’s status as a financial centre,” Hong Kong Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung told reporters. “It would provide a stable environment for businesses.”
Hong Kong’s most prominent tycoon Li Ka-shing said in a statement security laws were within every nation’s right, but Hong Kong had the “mission-critical task” to maintain trust domestically and globally in “one country, two systems”.
Hong Kong media reported Beijing had expanded the scope of the draft security legislation to include organisations as well as individuals.
The law was being revised to cover not just behaviour or acts that endanger national security, but also activities, local broadcaster RTHK and the South China Morning Post reported.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the United States this week would announce a strong response to the planned security legislation for Hong Kong.
The U.S.-China Business Council (USCBC) said urged “all leaders to take those steps necessary to de-escalate tensions, promote economic recovery and the rule of law, and preserve the ‘one country, two systems’ principle.”
Asian shares slipped over rising tensions between the United States and China. Hong Kong shares led declines with the Hang Seng falling 0.46%, though it kept a bit of distance from a two-month low touched on Monday. [MKTS/GLOB]
Protesters and pro-democracy politicians say Hong Kong’s National Anthem Bill, which aims to govern the use and playing of the Chinese national anthem, represents another sign of what they see as accelerating interference from Beijing.
The bill carries penalties of up to three years jail and/or fines of up to HK$50,000 ($6,450) for those who insult the anthem. It also orders that primary and secondary school students in Hong Kong be taught to sing the “March of the Volunteers”, along with its history and etiquette."

Yet they boast that the are the best democracy in the world!! What a joke? They also boast that they are the richest country in the world! Considering the national debt of many trillions, they are actually even poorer that Zimbabwe ! If we take away the USD reserve currency status it will be obvious to all that US is like an emperor without clothes. I hope that China and the rest of the world wake up to remove that privilege accorded to the Americans who have been abusing that privilege by threatening many countries with sanctions because they have to use the USD for international trading.
The US and allies are showing their hypocrisy by condemning China for introducing a security law which curbs subversion, terrorism, sedition,etc. They don’t want these in their countries but the want these in Hong Kong, in the name of freedom and democracy, with the sole self serving purpose of destabilizing China. What hypocrites !"

It likes to suppress and destroy dictatarship and autocracy or communism govt. To them all must follow US model. My foot. See what happened in the middle east. The mess of destruction and loss of countless lives they created without any accountability and responsibility. Everybody must listen to Uncle Sam or risk being bombed or kidnapped in broad to daylight to face justice in their country. If that not enough to enact laws to punish unfriendly countries. US is actually not democracy but has become closer to autocracy and dictatorship. It has appointed itself a world police officer going round with baton to threaten and bully smaller and non-nuclear countries and even bombed any country without UN mandate and UN also used to be its puppet but now if another playing the same game it then tried to accuse UN of not being fair and another country centric and so on. It is always ready to meddle in other countries to further its political and economic interests but accuse others of doing likewise. US now can't even defeat Covid-19 and until now so many American lives are lost and yet they are busy shifting the blame to China. Save lives first and get the priority right first. Why so dumb!"

The amount was lower compared with two consecutive weeks previously, on May 12-14 and May 4-7, which recorded RM734.18 million and RM736.28 million respectively, of foreign net selling.
An analyst told Bernama that the decline in value of foreign disposals for the week under review might have been a result of the CMCO implementation, which allows the economy to gradually reopen, and had progressively helped in boosting the country’s economy and rebuild consumers’ as well as investors’ confidence.
“Perhaps, going forward, we will see international funds making a comeback into Bursa Malaysia if the spread of Covid-19 remains contained and healthcare capacity remains robust,” he said.
The CMCO was announced by Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, under which most economic and social activities are allowed to operate starting from May 4, following positive results from two to six strategies to combat Covid-19, strict measures to contain the outbreak and building resilience through the Prihatin Rakyat Economic Stimulus Package.
On May 1, Muhyiddin said Malaysia was losing an estimated RM2.4 billion a day due to the MCO, with total losses estimated at around RM63 billion then.
Meanwhile, Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd chief economist Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said the average participation of foreign funds stood at 14.59% during the first four days of the week compared with 15.86% in the corresponding period last week.
“Local institutions recorded a lower net buy of RM389.29 million between May 18 and May 21, compared with RM611.27 million previously, while local retail investors’ net buy this week eased to RM5.04 million from RM122.91 million before,” he told Bernama.
He noted that the FBM KLCI stayed above the 1,400-point level over the past week, but the benchmark index fell by 15.35 points last Friday to close at 1,436.76, in sync with a decline in major indices in Asia and the US.
“The gradual reopening of the economy as well as positive developments of a Covid-19 vaccine appear to have lent some support to the market.
“Nonetheless, economic numbers continue to remain weak, alongside the potential stand-off between the US and China over the latest security law in Hong Kong,” he added.
Mohd Afzanizam said China was seen exerting more control over Hong Kong and this had led negative reaction from US lawmakers.
“Prior to this, constant criticism by US officials of the origination of the pandemic from China could jeopardise bilateral relations between the two countries.
“It’s a bit of a tug of war between optimism about the reopening of the economy and geopolitical risks, and to some degree the intermittent rise in new infection cases as well as weak economic data that would result in market sentiments to remain guarded,” he said.
As such, he expected market sentiments to be cautious next week, also following the holiday-shortened week next week which will mean less trading volume on the bourse.
“Perhaps the KLCI is expected to be in range-bound mode in the immediate term,” he added.
Bursa Malaysia Bhd and its subsidiaries will be closed tomorrow and on Tuesday in lieu of the Hari Raya Aidilfitri celebrations today. Trading will resume on Wednesday.
Throughout the week, the market traded mostly higher, with trading volume reaching an all-time high of 11.21 billion units, supported by an overwhelming buying interest from retail participants amid the lower overnight policy rate (OPR) of 2%.
On Monday last week, Yang di-Pertuan Agong Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri'ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah, during his royal address at the opening of the third term of the 14th Parliament, called on the government to look for ways to help companies and businesses affected by the Covid-19 pandemic.
His Majesty expressed confidence, saying that with good cooperation and cohesion, the challenges faced will be resolved together.
The King also called on the government to continue to simplify business processes to enhance investment activities, including the need to update existing laws, approval processes and incentives.
His Majesty said the government would continue to formulate, introduce and implement various programmes and initiatives to spur economic activities to improve the people's income and well-being, and in this regard, the Shared Prosperity Vision 2030 will be a catalyst for the nation's development direction."

Top lawyers and politicians from 23 countries express grave concerns over ‘assault’ on city’s rights and freedoms"

In a strongly worded statement, the 186 signatories said they had “grave concerns” about the legislation and feared it would jeopardise the city’s future.
“The statement shows growing and widespread international outrage at the decision by the Chinese government to unilaterally impose national security legislation in Hong Kong,” Patten said.

Critics say the new security law effectively spells the end of Hong Kong’s current way of life. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has described it as a “death knell” for the city’s autonomy.
Beijing’s decision to legislate for the territory effectively sweeps aside the promises made when the city was handed over to China from British colonial rule in 1997. At the time, Hong Kong was guaranteed 50 years of autonomy, with all civil rights and freedoms preserved for that time."

“This is the most serious threat to the people of Hong Kong that there has been from the Chinese government since 1997,” said Malcolm Rifkind, the former UK foreign secretary and one of the statement’s signatories. “The people of Hong Kong need, and deserve, our support.”
Offences covered, including “treason, secession, sedition [and] subversion”, are used to detain and silence government critics on the mainland. The draft version of the legislation also allows Chinese security forces to set up outposts in the city.

And Hong Kong authorities have made clear they will use their new powers to crack down on pro-democracy protests that have roiled the city for nearly a year.
A heavy crackdown will not tackle the grievances driving the protest movement, which over the last year only escalated as the city’s police force turned to increasingly aggressive tactics, the international group said.
“It is the genuine grievances of ordinary Hong Kongers that are driving protests. Draconian laws will only escalate the situation further, jeopardising Hong Kong’s future as an open Chinese international city,” the statement said.
Policy-makers and politicians from across the political spectrum, and around the world, put their names to the statement. In the UK, they include chair of the foreign affairs committee, Tom Tugendhat, two former leaders of the Conservative party, and the prominent human rights campaigner, Baroness Helena Kennedy."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=194","May 29, 2020 1:06 PM","traderstrades","Amongst the excellent and award-winning work that Suaram has undertaken is detailing and documenting the abuses by the Malaysian authorities using laws such as the Sedition Act, the Internal Security Act (ISA), the Emergency Ordinance, the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act (Sosma) and numerous incidents of deaths in police or law enforcement custody and enforced disappearances.
Indeed Kua himself, and many from Suaram and their supporters, have suffered from the abuse of these laws. Many of these laws derive from provisions in the Federal Constitution dealing with national security and times of emergency that allow for draconian legislation that has the effect of violating the human rights and fundamental liberties of thousands of people over the years.
These are the same or similar over-arching provisions upon which the government of China is now relying, and which Kua appears to be defending.
It, thus, comes as a complete and utter shock that Kua would suggest that the government of China should not be criticised because to quote: “China has not broken any human rights in Hong Kong yet.”
Must we wait for the house to be burnt down before we accept the warning that it is dangerous to play with fire? And the point is, China does not come to this with a clean slate or clean hands.
When you add to what is being proposed the kidnapping of individuals from Hong Kong who then show up in mainland China, either in detention or being charged in court, and the countless mainland Chinese lawyers prosecuted/jailed and banned from practice for trying to defend human rights cases or causes, you have no choice but to be very deeply concerned.
Yet Kua is prepared to advise and adopt a “wait and see” approach and to grant the government of mainland China the luxury of the benefit of the doubt. Who knows, he seems to suggest. Wait till we see the actual wording of the specific law. Maybe it won’t be so bad.
Sadly, it is a luxury the democratic and progressively-minded people of Hong Kong can ill-afford."

Kua is a China apologist. He is whitewashing China’s sins by diverting the focus on the sins of those who criticise it.
There are plenty like him, making excuses for China's incarceration of one million Muslims in Xinjiang, its bullying tactics in the South China Sea or the way it handled the Covid-19 outbreak and the spread of the disease, and of course, its evisceration of the ‘one country two systems’ promises made to Hong Kong.
There are many ways to oppress and violate human rights without sending out the army. People have been abducted off the streets and disappeared, protesters have been confronted with brutal force, laws have been passed just to legalise previously illegal actions by the Hong Kong government, which is a Chinese stooge. Kua chooses to see no evil in any of these actions and interprets the violation to suit his bias.
No nation is above scrutiny or reprimand if their actions so demand it. Every day we read op-eds critical of US President Donald Trump and the United States and Kua is clearly okay with that. Why is China untouchable?
If people who are beyond the heavy hand of Chinese President Xi Jinping and the full force of communist China do not speak up, then are we to stand by, watch and twiddle our thumbs while China crushes all who dare to resist?

PUTRAJAYA: The Immigration Department and Foreign Ministry are working closely to ensure that illegal migrants who are rounded up during raids are deported safely to their countries of origin.
Senior Minister (Security Cluster) Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said the agencies have also been instructed to work out the necessary arrangements for the immigrants to be deported.
He dismissed claims by non-governmental organisations, including the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (Suhakam), that the government agencies act inhumanely when carrying out raids on undocumented migrants amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
""It is wrong to say that we were being inhumane (towards the illegal immigrants). Regardless, the status of immigrants hauled up by the Immigration Department remains as Pati (pendatang asing tanpa izin or illegal immigrants), and have no right to remain in the country.
""We will discuss with their countries of origin on deporting them, as we don't want to send them to jail as some were caught while entering the country through rat lanes.
""To say the raids we carried out during the Enhanced Movement Control Order (EMCO) were inhumane is inaccurate. During the EMCO placed on Selangor Mansion, (it was learned that) there were 586 illegal immigrants living there,"" he told a press conference today.
He said when the EMCO ended, the authorities removed the barbed wires to allow residents to move freely.
""The illegal immigrants, however, do not have travel documents. The Immigration Department would be wrong if it allowed them roam freely.""
Ismail Sabri said documented migrants and foreigners with work permits are protected by the law, enjoy Social Security Organisation (Socso) benefits, and basic facilities like accommodation.
""We agree that we need them in estates, construction and other sectors under 3D (dirty, dangerous, difficult), but we must follow the laws under the International Labour Organisation (ILO).

In May 2018, Malaysia faced an especially turbulent election. The Muslim country’s veteran ruling party—led by the allegedly corrupt Prime Minister Najib Razak—was gasping for air.
During the campaign, no less than 2,300 candidates were attempting to dethrone Najib, who, throughout his 10-year reign, had rolled back human rights in the country, persecuted minority religious groups and members of the LGBTQ community, diminished free speech, and limited the freedom of the press. Najib was also accused of embezzling billions in state funds, and he and his family members were known for their lavish, eye-popping lifestyle."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=195","May 29, 2020 2:44 PM","ChineseKungFuMaster","The pressure felt by Najib’s party, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), was so immense that, just over a month before the election, the Malaysian government signed a deal to acquire a system that allowed it to gather information and analyze data on civilian activity. The system was meant to be used by Malaysian intelligence agency the Special Branch (SB) to surveil political activists for the opposition, according to court documents obtained and reviewed by Calcalist. The company that developed and supplied the system to the Malaysian government was Senpai Technologies Ltd., a small Israeli cybersecurity startup.
The deal was signed in April 2018 with a price tag of $1.5 million and received the code name “Project Magnum.” Since Israel and Malaysia have no official diplomatic relations, the deal was signed through a Cypriot conduit company called Kohai Corp. Ltd., founded by two Senpai shareholders for the sole purpose of serving as a front for such deals. The Malaysian government’s plans for Senpai’s system were not kept secret from the company and its use for “political investigations״ is specifically mentioned in internal email correspondence.
Malaysia was not Senpai’s only controversial potential client and, according to documents reviewed by Calcalist, it had previously negotiated a deal to sell its services to the Sultanate of Oman on the southeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula, which also has no diplomatic ties to Israel.
Not many have heard of Senpai, whose activity has since been frozen, but it is just one in a long line of Israeli cyber companies that do not shy away from working with totalitarian regimes and countries that have no relations with Israel. Like many of its competitors, Senpai aimed sky high. In May 2019, It WAS reported that Senpai is planning to join cyber-focused consortium Intellexa Ltd., in hopes of forming a market-leading alliance that could compete with companies, such as NSO Group and Nasdaq-listed Verint Systems Inc."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=195","May 29, 2020 2:44 PM","ChineseKungFuMaster","Senpai’s flag product was RogueEye, a system that collects information on people from openly available online sources, such as social networks, and cross-references and analyzes it to produce intelligence reports for secret services, police forces, militaries, and business entities. Among RogueEye’s official data collection methods is a network of avatars (fake social network profiles) that follow the target and extract information through direct interaction with them.
A year after the election in Malaysia, according to correspondence obtained by Calcalist, Senpai was getting ready to sign a new contract with the SB that required adjusting the goals of the original contract in light of UMNO’s staggering defeat. “The client got the documents and we are waiting for his response,” Senpai co-founder and head of sales Roy Shloman said referring to “Magnum” in an email sent to fellow co-founders Guy David, Omri Raiter, and Eric Banoun on June 10, 2019.
“As you know, after the elections many things changed and became a bit more complicated,” Shloman wrote. “As for the client’s management process and based on some of the past conference calls with them, I think that we shall plan a visit to KL (Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur, TG and HR)” he added.
""The main purpose of such a trip is to meet the client (face to face), conduct some Q&A sessions, and provide them with some tips and tricks on how to maximize the system,” Shloman continued. “Bear in mind, that their objectives changed after elections from political investigations to more criminal-terror investigations,” he wrote.
In his email, Shloman said he believes the changes in ML (Malaysia, TG and HR), should bring Senpai to change its business model. “We can do it together with our current channels,” he wrote, “and to offer such services to the business sector and to the low budgeted governmental agencies.”"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=195","May 29, 2020 2:45 PM","ChineseKungFuMaster","Senpai’s sales targets and potential additional clients were discussed in a May 2019 Whatsapp correspondence between Banoun, often described as the company’s growth engine, responsible for securing clients and deals, and Intellexa’s owner, retired Israeli colonel Tal Dillian. In the correspondence obtained by Calcalist, Banoun lists future contracts that have been discussed verbally.
For Malaysia’s phase two agreements, Banoun counted, $300,000-$400,000 from the SB, between $2 million and $2.5 million from the country’s Prime Minister’s Office, between $800,000 and $2.2 million from the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, and a similar sum from the police. Banoun also mentioned a potential deal in Oman for between $1.2 million and $2.5 million. It is unclear whether these deals were eventually signed.
Najib first rose to power in 2009 when he won the Prime Minister’s seat in a landslide. This came as no surprise, as Najib’s father before him was a beloved prime minister who also headed UMNO, the country’s ruling party since it declared independence in 1957. Najib’s father, Abdul Razak Hussein, had a record of top government roles including as the minister of defense, the minister of education, and the minister of finance and was considered the one responsible for saving Malaysia from the 2008 global financial crisis.
Abdul Razak was popular thanks to his liberal policies that placed great importance on direct communication between the government and its citizens and on financial growth, which was essential to the prosperity of the developing country.
After his election, Najib established a government investment fund called 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), intended to invest in global collaborations. The Malaysian government transferred over $1 billion to the fund, which raised an additional sum of at least $6.5 billion in state bonds. Following various media reports and a rigorous investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, it appeared the fund benefitted Najib and his associates most of all.
In its first months of activity, 1MDB invested billions of taxpayer Malaysian ringgits in a line of shady companies, some of which seem to have been established for this sole purpose. The fund’s management was entrusted in the hands of Jho Low, a little-known businessman, who was friends with Najib’s stepson as well as with several billionaires from the Gulf States.
It is possible that the alleged grandiose embezzlement would not have come to light if the people benefiting from it led a slightly more modest life, but they did the complete opposite of that. Low became famous for organizing grandiose parties. He paid American superstars, including Paris Hilton and Jamie Foxx, millions just to hang out with him, hired Britney Spears to jump out of a cake, and gifted luxury Bugatti cars to friends.
Najib’s second wife, Rosmah Mansor, rightfully earned the nickname the Malaysian Imelda Marcos—after the former first lady of the Philippines, known for her lavish lifestyle—due to her fondness for spending. According to the U.S. Department of Justice’s findings, Rosmah spent at least $6 million taken from the state fund. At one time, Rosmah reportedly filled a jet plane with luxury items acquired on a single shopping spree.
Malaysian taxpayer money funded the prime minister and his entourage’s frighteningly lavish lifestyles. Among Najib’s assets are three Manhattan properties: a $30 million penthouse at the Time Warner Center, a $33 million condo at Park Laurel Condominiums, and another $51 million penthouse. He also owns a $31 million mansion in Beverly Hills, a Los Angeles home priced at nearly $40 million, a $42 million London townhouse, a private business jet by Canadian company Bombardier Inc., nearly $100 million worth of paintings by Vincent Van Gogh and Claude Monet, and a Hollywood production company that was behind the 2013 hit starring Leonardo DiCaprio, “The Wolf of Wall Street”, which ironically dealt with the hedonistic lifestyle of another embezzler."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=195","May 29, 2020 2:46 PM","ChineseKungFuMaster","The embezzlement was not limited to Malaysia’s ruling family and its associates. Najib took office shortly after the 2008 financial crisis, while investment bankers who managed to survive turned to the east in search of alternative markets.
Tim Leissner, then a partner at Goldman Sachs responsible for south-east Asia, also wanted a piece of Malaysia’s billion-dollar pie. Subsequently, Goldman Sachs issued $3.5 billion worth of bonds for 1MDB in exchange for $600 million, some 200 times the normally accepted fee. According to the allegations, this excessive payment constituted a bribe for turning a blind eye to the fund's corruption and illegal activity.
By 2015, 1MDB was in so much debt, that the Malaysian government had to find additional sources to fund it. Among other things, it emptied the national Hajj fund, used by the country’s Muslim majority to save for a pilgrimage to Mecca. Many citizens deposited money there for decades to be able to afford the religious ritual, which every observant Muslim is required to perform at least once in their lifetime.
When the embezzlement became public around a year later it led to a vast public outcry in Malaysia. Najib responded to the protests with a strong hand, jailing oppositionists and promoting legislation limiting the right of protest. The closer the 2018 election got, the more tense the situation in Malaysia became.
In January that year, Najib’s political mentor, Mahathir Mohamad who was the country’s prime minister between 1981 and 2003, announced he will be running for the seat again to fight corruption. Najib then decided to take his efforts to crush the opposition up a notch, and that is when Senpai came in the picture.
It is not often that government spy deals are exposed, and it is even more rare to find written evidence that the supplying company was completely aware of the type of use a government intended to make of its product. In fact, if it were not for A financial dispute between Senpai’s CO-founders, which found its way to a Tel Aviv court last year, the documents and correspondence exposing the company’s extensive activity would likely not have seen the light of day.
According to the documents submitted to the court, Senpai also provided its services in Mexico, Aquador, Gabon, Angola, Kenya, Indonesia, and Singapore. The price list it presented to potential clients ranged between $1.2 million and $1.6 million for the RogueEye system, $750,000-$1 million for the operation of avatars, and between $30,000 and $70,000 in monthly fees. Overall, Senpai’s deals since its establishment in 2016 amounted to over $9 million.
Officially, Senpai claimed its system only collects publicly available data, but correspondence between Shloman and one of the company’s salesmen, submitted to the court and reviewed by Calcalist, revealed that RogueEye also analyzes data from phones infected by spyware. The salesman, one Gregory Krasnostein, specifically wrote to Shloman that “Senpai’s system collected the data from the infected phone and is analyzing it.”
But, even Senpai’s officially declared activity of mining data using fake accounts is not free from ethical and legal concerns. “Using avatars to gather information is a very common practice for cyber companies,” an executive from the Israeli cyber industry told Calcalist on condition of anonymity. “This lets you collect information without having to hack anything and on some websites, for example, online forums, nobody uses their real name anyway,” he added.
It being common practice, however, does not necessarily also make it legal. “This is a complex issue in international law,” the executive said. “Consider, for example, creating a fake user to converse with a hacker and exchange information that I need to defend a client. Is it morally acceptable to negotiate with a criminal, even to exchange information with them? It would appear that the right course of action is to report them to the authorities.”
Senpai, like other Israeli cyber companies, chose to sell its services and products to countries that have no diplomatic relations with Israel through conduit companies. “This is a very common practice for Israeli companies that station most of their workforce outside of Israel,” the executive said.
It is important to keep in mind however, he said, that offensive cyber companies must gain an export license from the Israeli Ministry of Defense. He mentioned one well known company that has the ministry’s approval yet sells to Gulf States through its subsidiaries. This means that Israel is either fully aware of its conduct, or that the company is covering its tracks and fooling it using various business entities, he said. “Gulf States on their part also need to cover their tracks when buying Israeli technology,” he added."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=195","May 29, 2020 2:47 PM","ChineseKungFuMaster","Another executive at a large cyber company who spoke to Calcalist on condition of anonymity said that more often than not, the client countries are even more reluctant to be associated with an Israeli product. “The offensive cyber industry,” he said, “is, in a way, parallel to the conventional military industry. Spyware may not kill people, but it does give the state a lot of power against its citizens.”
As previously mentioned, Senpai is just one of many Israeli cyber companies linked to non-democratic regimes, shady clients, controversial practices, or run-ins with the law. NSO, the developer of spyware Pegasus is perhaps the best known of the bunch. In October, encrypted messaging app WhatsApp and its parent company Facebook filed a lawsuit against NSO alleging the former and its Luxembourg-based affiliate Q Cyber Technologies Ltd. used WhatsApp’s servers to deliver malware to Approximately 1, 400 devices, to surveil certain USERS, around 100 of which were human rights activists and journalists."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=195","May 29, 2020 2:47 PM","ChineseKungFuMaster","Even before Facebook’s lawsuit, NSO’s name has repeatedly been linked to a series of questionable practices such as surveillance of human rights activists and journalists in Mexico, the hacking of an iPhone owned by a civil rights activist in the United Arab Emirates, and allegedly playing a part in the slaying of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. Most recently, last year, members of human rights organization Amnesty International petitioned a Tel Aviv court to revoke NSO’s license after it allegedly targeted Amnesty members. NSO has repeatedly denied all of the aforementioned allegations.
Other Israeli companies to be linked to questionable regimes and surveillance against civilians are Cyberbit Ltd.—recently sold to American Investment firm Charlesbank Technology Opportunities Fund by its parent company Israeli defense contractor Elbit Systems Ltd.—which, according to Canadian research center The Citizen Lab, provided the Ethiopian government with spyware software that was used to track journalists and dissidents; AnyVision Interactive Technologies Ltd., whose facial recognition technologies were reportedly used by Israeli forces to spy on Palestinians in the West Bank, costing it an investment from Microsoft; and DarkMatter, which operates out of the United Arab Emirates and employs veterans of Israel’s military intelligence and technology units. According to the New York Times, DarkMatter developed a popular chat app called ToTok, which turned out to be a means for the Emirati government to spy on its citizens and extract data from their phones.
The severity of the cases in which Israeli companies were involved, brought David Kaye, the United Nations’ special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, to name Israel in a May 2019 report calling states to “impose an immediate moratorium on the export, sale, transfer, use or servicing of privately developed surveillance tools until a human rights-compliant safeguards regime is in place.”
Kaye explained his position, writing that “surveillance of specific individuals—often journalists, activists, opposition figures, critics, and others exercising their right to freedom of expression—has been shown to lead to arbitrary detention, sometimes to torture, and possibly to extrajudicial killings.”"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=195","May 29, 2020 2:48 PM","ChineseKungFuMaster","Kaye also mentioned NSO and Israel’s refusal to revoke its export license. He also wrote that a lack of substantial international pressure and a veil of secrecy justified by claims of national security are a major obstacle in regulating the export of cyber offensive technologies.
Kaye also mentioned that despite being one of the world’s biggest offensive cyber exporters, Israel is not an active member of the Wassenaar Arrangement, an international arrangement meant to regulate the sector. Israel has included items from the Wassenaar Arrangement’s control list to its own list of controlled goods, Kaye wrote, yet its level of enforcement in the country is unclear.
Senpai was founded in 2016 by five local tech veterans: Shloman, Banoun, David, Raiter, and Jonathan Lampert. Banoun was formerly employed by the cyber and intelligence unit of Nasdaq-listed software company Nice Ltd. and helped NSO market its Pegasus system to a country that cannot be specified due to a court-mandated gag-order. Lampert served as a sales manager for several defense contractors, including Paz Logistics Ltd., which, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, served as a mediator for the sale of military products to foreign law enforcement agencies. Shloman, according to his LinkedIn page, was formerly an executive at Verint.
Last month, the dispute between Senpai’s co-founders ended when the parties signed a confidential settlement and requested the court cancel the lawsuit. The lawsuit was originally filed by Lampert, Banoun, and Shloman, who alleged that their partners David and Raiter conspired with Dillian to steal the company away from them. Though it remains unclear if Senpai was indeed sold to Intellexa in the end, its system is currently offered to clients on the latter’s website.
The lawsuit also alleged Dillian was subject to an investigation by the internal military police for fiscal irregularities which led to his dismissal from the army. In 2019, Dillian was involved in a high profile affair involving a “spy van” confiscated by the Cipryote police. The van was developed by a company co-founded by Dillian in which Banoun was also a party.
Senpai’s activity was not enough to save Najib and UMNO’s regime, and shortly after losing the 2018 election, he was arrested by the Malaysian authorities on suspicion of receiving some $10 million as a bribe from a private company. The Malaysian police froze Najib’s assets, confiscating more than $220 million worth of real estate properties, diamonds, jewelry, purses, and watches. Najib’s trial began in April last year and is still ongoing."

Old habits, however, die hard, and despite his many promises, as prime minister, Mahathir has only enacted a fraction of the reforms he had promised in his campaign. Even though many of Najib’s draconian laws were canceled by the new government, quite a few laws were left in place, giving the regime extensive power over the press."

Relations between the two sides are likely to carry on worsening after the US President said he would end the city’s preferential status after Beijing ‘smothered its freedom’
Observers predict spiral of retaliation will continue and question whether trade negotiations will be able to carry on
China and the US have little room to defuse tensions after Washington announced it would end Hong Kong’s special status, observers believe.
On Friday Donald Trump announced he would move to end agreements that gave the city preferential treatment over trade and travel and said he would sanction officials responsible for “absolutely smothering Hong Kong’s freedom”.
The move came after China’s national legislature approved for a national security law in the former British colony, in what critics described as an abandonment of the “one country, two systems” model of semi-autonomy.
Beijing has said it will respond to the latest US move, but has refrained from hitting back immediately, while state media coverage has remained relatively low key.

Beijing has said it will respond to the latest US move, but has refrained from hitting back immediately, while state media coverage has remained relatively low key.
But observers believe that the tensions between the two sides are likely to escalate further given their competing interests across the globe in areas such as trade, technology and ideology."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=197","Jun 1, 2020 2:38 PM","MoneyMachineMaker发发发","Wei Zongyou, a professor of China-US relations at Fudan University in Shanghai, said there was little possibility of tensions cooling and predicted that decoupling would intensify in a range of fields.
“As we see both sides take turns for revenge and countermeasures, it is unlikely there can be continued trade negotiation,” he said,
“The two countries lack an effective communication channel at present, and both sides are in a competition to see who is tougher.”
In his latest attack on Beijing, Trump accused the Chinese government of intellectual property theft, covering up its mishandling of the Covid-19 outbreak and abandoning its commitments to the World Trade Organisation.
The US president also said he would withdraw the US from the World Health Organisation due to Beijing’s perceived influence in the agency, move to end an extradition treaty with Hong Kong and increase scrutiny of Chinese companies listed on US financial markets.
“The Chinese government’s move against Hong Kong is the latest in a series of measures that are diminishing the city’s long-standing and very proud status – this is a tragedy for the people of Hong Kong, the people of China, and indeed the people of the world,” he said.
The White House later said it would expel Chinese graduate students with ties to Beijing’s “military-civil fusion strategy” – a move that could affect as many as 3,000 students.
David Zweig, director of the Centre on China’s Transnational Relations at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said Trump had “taken the gloves off” and expected things to escalate further in the run-up to the US elections in November.
“Nobody wants to fight a war, but I think it’s going to be hard in the build-up to the election to take too moderate a position,” Zweig said.
“China’s very unpopular in lots of places, so it’s easier for the West to ratchet up their side, and I think it’s the same thing on the Chinese side.”
The latest study from Pew found that said China’s standing in America was at its lowest point since 2005, with around two thirds of respondents viewing the country unfavourable."

“If you’re the CEO of an American company in Hong Kong, or even a mainland company in Hong Kong, and you don’t have an exit strategy from Hong Kong, then you should be fired,” Zweig said.
“It’s tit-for-tat so far, and if the tits and the tats continue, then your exit strategy may have to be materialised, so you better have the strategy.”
Denny Roy, a senior fellow at the Hawaii-based East-West Centre, said many in the US had been angered by Trump’s announcement that the US would withdraw from the WHO in the middle of a pandemic and his failure to address nationwide protests over police brutality and racism.
While there was great sympathy in the US for the Hong Kong people, he said the US would be unable to force China to restore the city’s freedom.
“America is not going to war with China over this,” he said. “Washington will take some kind of symbolic action to express our dismay.
“I hope very much it will be calibrated to cause pain to PRC [People’s Republic of China] elites but not to further endanger the livelihoods of ordinary Hongkongers, who will probably have a harder time now as some foreign banks and corporations pull out.”"

Zoologist I think this is where the US is going to get exposed in the coming few decades. America’s existence on a relative basis to other countries is pretty infant. Although I feel the US contributed greatly 100 years ago. The leadership and domination has lead to entitlement, bullying and just an ego that now thinks they can do no wrong. What’s worst is American culture and politics has become a game of the short term, which is always driven by decisions that mortgage the future. Take NATO and what it has become since. The US and it’s military presence in other countries is not strictly to help others, but also a way to gain political and economic leverage for themselves. The fact that Trump can try to hike South Korea’s bill from 1 billion to 5 billion says enough. You can only live off your past reputation for so long. The US’ goodwill is near used up and we will see in the coming decades"

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=198","Jun 1, 2020 3:40 PM","WellingtonSky","Beijing has reason to be pleased with the West’s relatively muted response to its plan to introduce a new national security law in Hong Kong, US analysts said, and increasingly confident in the decision to tighten its grip on the city.
Following Beijing’s passage of a security law, the US has revoked Hong Kong’s status as autonomous from China and threatened to revoke its special trade and investment privileges, without providing specifics.
The US also signed a joint letter of protest with Britain, Canada and Australia. And Britain has offered to extend citizenship to some Hong Kong residents if China remains on the same course.
“Beijing is probably thinking, a lot of bark and little bite,” said Andrew Coflan, a China analyst with the Eurasia Group consultancy.
US President Donald Trump outlined various threatened actions on Friday, without details, including what restrictions would apply to Chinese students or the timeline on any trade or customs actions, he said."

“Protesters have time and again instigated violence and clamoured for Hong Kong’s ‘independence’, crossing a red line for the central government,” he said."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=198","Jun 1, 2020 3:43 PM","WellingtonSky","“At the same time, external forces have increasingly interfered in Hong Kong affairs without scruple. Because of this, Hong Kong is in disarray.”Cui said the Hong Kong government tried for 23 years to enact security laws but the opposition had sought to “strangle them”, prompting Beijing to act.
Hong Kong would retain a “high degree of autonomy”, and residents need not worry as long as they avoided “splitting the country, subverting the government, committing terrorist activities and externally meddling”, he said.
US analysts said that once the ruling Communist Party of China became impatient with the unrest and decided it had to crack down on Hong Kong – despite commitments to maintain its relative autonomy under a “one country, two systems” formula agreed to before the 1997 handover from Britain – it started honing its calculations.
Driving the decision, they said, was concern that the protracted protests made it look weak domestically and that unrest could spread into southern China despite successful efforts to portray many Hongkongers as ungrateful and unpatriotic."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=198","Jun 1, 2020 3:43 PM","WellingtonSky","Also in its calculations, analysts said, was the likelihood that the Covid-19 crisis would keep some percentage of Hong Kong protesters off the streets given fears of infection and that the global health crisis would keep some number of foreign nations distracted.
“If you’re pretty sure you have to take this step anyways, from their perspective, you might as well do it now,” said Joshua Eisenman, an associate professor at the University of Notre Dame’s Keough School of Global Affairs in Indiana. “You want to pay the least cost for it that you can.”
US analysts said Beijing and the Hong Kong government were not able – or had not spent the time – to address underlying concerns of residents in the city, which has one of the world’s largest rich-poor gaps.
“The decision by Beijing to impose a national security law to coerce obedience by the people of Hong Kong is a stark admission of the failure of their policy there,” said Daniel Russel, vice-president of the Asia Society Policy Institute in New York. “But it is also a failure of US policy.”
Russel, former president Barack Obama’s point person on Asian affairs, said it was likely China’s leaders had calculated that Trump’s penchant for acting alone, his attack on the World Health Organisation in the middle of a global pandemic and his divisive domestic policies would work in their favour.
“The Chinese government is no longer worried about what Washington thinks, nor is it afraid that the Trump administration can muster a unified international response,” he said."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=198","Jun 1, 2020 3:44 PM","WellingtonSky","As China’s economic and political clout has expanded and its nationalism become more pronounced under President Xi Jinping, international opinion holds far less sway, particularly on issues related to party control, analysts said.
“I just don’t believe that much of what happens in Washington or London is going to matter that much to Beijing’s Hong Kong policy,” said Eisenman, a former analyst with the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission.
“We’re all in reactive mode. Western leaders can huff and puff, but Hong Kong is China’s territory.”"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=198","Jun 29, 2020 2:58 PM","WellingtonSky","All else being equal, Beijing would rather that Hong Kong maintained its special US economic and trade status, but the financial capital has become less important to China’s economy. At the time of the British handover in 1997, Hong Kong accounted for about 18 per cent of China’s total GDP, a figure that is now below 4 per cent, according to World Bank figures.
And having Hong Kong more on a par with other Chinese cities offers certain political advantages, analysts said. Beijing’s tougher stance toward Hong Kong is popular on the mainland, which has tended to view the city’s residents as spoiled and unappreciative of China’s largesse, analysts said.
“This decision enjoys extensive support from Chinese people, including in Hong Kong, many of whom believe it should have been done long before,” Cui said in his article.
Coming further into Beijing’s orbit will also leave the city and its people garnering less international attention, overseas political support or economic ties.
“This is turning Hong Kong into just another city, and that’s exactly what Beijing wanted,” Sun Yun, director of the China programme at the Stimson Centre, a think tank in Washington, said at a National Committee on US China Relations event.
“I suspect in Beijing’s calculation the economic cost of the removal of the special status of Hong Kong will be carried by many, but the political benefits will be enjoyed by Beijing,” she said."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=198","Jun 1, 2020 3:44 PM","WellingtonSky","That is not to suggest Beijing will not pay some price for its decision to enact the security law, analysts said.
As well as any targeted sanctions Trump hands down, the move has further angered the US Congress, which is already considering dozens of anti-China bills. It also could add momentum to US plaintiffs claiming damages suffered because of Beijing’s delay in stemming the spread of the virus, lawsuits that rankle China.
Beijing’s tough stance also highlights to third countries working with China, including its Belt and Road Initiative, the “potential negative consequences of economic involvement with China”, said Terry Haines, an independent policy analyst and former Congressional staffer.
But these steps, and Thursday’s joint statement against the new security law signed by the US, Britain, Canada and Australia, ultimately are not giving Beijing too many sleepless nights, analysts said.
“It’s a lot of ink,” Eisenman said. “Does it make one Hongkonger more free? No. Does it change any of the other facts on the ground? Not really. It’s a nice sentiment, but it won't change Beijing's approach.”"

To me Hong Kong's manufacturing prowess was left to die during the last century.

My opinion is that this law is aimed at the Legco elections since things are getting out of hand for the pro-est. camp. They did themselves no favours in handing 5.4 billion to Ocean Park which can only let them survive for another year. Voters will be thinking how much of our reserves will be funneled to vested interests if the pro-est. camp retains a majority. Vultures are swooping overhead to get a slice of our money and the current government is burning money whilst not lifting a finger to help ordinary civilians.
On the new law, as long as it isnt retroactive we have to accept it whether we like it or not but if it is retroactive and candidates are disqualified from participating in the elections it is as clear as crystal on the real intentions of this new law."

HK can recover from the chaotic mess and return to normal hopefully. Let this Oriental Pearl shine again and remove and arrest those evil foreign intelligence agencies trying to destroy HK and its young generation. We have to thank China for taking this decisive action quickly to protect HK.
China should also play a role in protecting all Asian countries from USA and Western interference. The Great Asia has over 4.6 billion population and its future economic growth potential is huge provided there is a peaceful and safe environment. N. America has 0.37 billion, a 12 times difference. So China can forget N. American and put its effort in helping and developing the Great Asia to be the best place in the world. China has the ability to do so. Even there are many disputes among the Asian countries, but those can become minor if all can work towards the bigger goal of Great Asian development as a whole. It's time for Asia to stay away from Western colonialization shadow and their looting os Asian wealth. Asia can become strong again if those evil foreign intelligence agencies are not there."

By stirring trouble in HK, it helped the weak Taiwan pro-independence President win back the election, thus, keeping Taiwan under US influence. China is fully aware of US CIA agents on HK ground, but due to the lack of national security law, HK is not able to act against these agents. China hopes HKgers enact Article 23 by her own, unfortunately, they were undermined by foreign agents working on HK ground. So, China took a decisive action in enact the national security law in HK.
Nevertheless, HK govt never attend to the serious concern of young HKgers with a reasonable housing policy, leaving the young frustrated and angry. With this, foreign agents can heat up the frustration onto the HK streets. If reasonable housing policy is not put in place, it will still trigger outbursts, security law or no law."

The country currently has five candidate vaccines undergoing trials, four of which will need high levels of biosecurity to manufacture them safely
The Chinese authorities are keen to begin mass production as quickly as possible
China is laying the groundwork to begin manufacturing Covid-19 vaccines as soon as they are given the green light.
Although the five drugs being developed by the country’s scientists are still months away from a full evaluation, secure facilities are already being built.
The facilities will have a biosecurity rating of 3, the second highest level, because Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is highly pathogenic and will need a secure environment if it used to make the vaccine.
Four of the five Chinese candidates are inactivated vaccines – a technique that involves killing the virus so that it cannot cause a serious infection but does stimulate an immune response and requires secure facilities.
The other Chinese vaccine, and five developed in other countries, are using genetic techniques that need lower levels of biosecurity because the actual Sars-CoV-2 virus is not used in the production process."

Two CNBG subsidiaries – the Beijing Institute of Biological Products and Wuhan Institute of Biological Products – have designed inactivated vaccines that are undergoing phase 2 trials.
“The facility in Beijing has been completed and is in the process of qualifying for certification. The annual production capacity will be 100 million doses. The workshop in Wuhan has finished building the main structure … Its annual production capacity will be 80 million doses,” Yu said.
“After the two workshops begin production, they will effectively meet the need for large-scale inoculation and provide important guarantees over the availability and affordability of Covid-19 vaccines.”
Zhu Jingjin, party secretary of the CNBG, told state broadcaster CCTV last month this production capacity would meet the demands of “special population groups”, which he said included health workers, diplomatic staff, students studying abroad and people working on overseas infrastructure projects under the Belt and Road Initiative.
China has previously said it intends to vaccinate certain groups by the end of the year even if the trials have not finished.
Sinovac Research & Development, which recently received US$15 million in funding from two investors to boost the development of an inactivated vaccine dubbed CoronaVac, is also building a level 3 production facility in Beijing’s Daxing district."

Hualan Biological Engineering in Henan province and Kangtai Biological Products in the southern city of Shenzhen are both building level 3 facilities, according to the China Academy of Building Research.
The Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, whose inactivated vaccine is undergoing a phase 1 trial to check its is safe, is planning to build a similar facility later this year."

“Covid-19 has changed so much. Now the evaluation and review is calculated in hours, not days,” the expert said. “Sometimes site visits are done through video meetings to ensure efficiency.”
The expert said, even with China’s release system for vaccines – which requires every lot to be chemically and biologically tested before it is released – the extra workload can be handled with the current manpower.
“I wouldn’t worry about Covid-19 production or supply. The uncertainty is the quality of the vaccine itself,” the expert said.

Gao Fu said the National Immunisation Programme was drafting guidelines to determine who would be eligible to receive the vaccine.
With the number of daily reported infections in China now in single figures, vaccine developers could struggle to complete the final phase of trials because they will have not enough cases to draw comparisons with.
“The National Immunisation Programme is paying close attention and studying what groups of the population can take the shots, when to take them and what may constitute emergency use of vaccines,” Gao said on the sidelines of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference in Beijing on Saturday.
“I believe we will decide based upon the specific situations as we will not be following the usual protocol, otherwise time will be lost. Nor can we [decide] based on our knowledge of coronaviruses because the virus is very unique,” he said."

While there are more than 120 candidates under development, a vaccine jointly developed by Tianjin-based CanSino and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, was the first one in China to enter a double-blind, placebo-controlled second phase human trial to see how effective the vaccine is.

Gao acknowledged that vaccine candidates must be safe and effective, but Gao said a standard treatment may take 12 to 18 months to develop, but the fast-track vaccines could be used in emergencies or for groups with particular needs.
“The vaccines are not for the general public but for special groups. As the epidemic develops, certain groups of the general public might become special groups,” Gao added.
Zhu Jingjin, party secretary of the China National Biotec Group, whose subsidiaries in Wuhan and Beijing have started human trials on two vaccines, told state broadcaster CCTV last month that his company has the production capacity to meet the demand of “special population groups”, which he said included health workers, diplomatic staff, students studying abroad and people working on overseas infrastructure projects under the Belt and Road Initiative.
Gao, an immunologist and virologist who earned a doctorate at the University of Oxford and did postdoctoral research there and at Harvard University, has been personally involved in the search for the intermediary species that transmitted the coronavirus that causes the disease – which is believed to have originated in bats – to humans."

Gao was also involved in collecting samples in January at the Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market, originally believed to the source of infection, following a cluster of cases among people living and working nearby.
However, the animal samples tested were free from Sars-CoV-2 and the virus was only found in waste water in the market.
“We first believed the virus originated in the seafood market, but now it looks like that the market is just another victim. The virus existed [before the infections happened in the market],” Gao said.
Countries including the US and Australia have criticised China for delays in making public the spread of the disease in Wuhan, and accused it of refusing to share samples from the Wuhan market and covering up information.
China, however, has rejected the criticism saying it acted quickly to share the genome sequence of the coronavirus and has worked closely with the WHO in combating the pandemic."

“Australians are very poorly protected in terms of fundamental human rights. Unlike every other democracy, there is no human rights law enshrined in the constitution or even as an ordinary act of parliament,” he said.
CAMPAIGN FOR CHANGE
UN Secretary General António Guterres has said that hate speech and xenophobia seen across the world show the Covid-19 pandemic, besides being a public health emergency and an economic and social crisis, was turning into a human rights crisis.
Australia, where Asian ethnic minorities make up roughly 13 to 14 per cent of the 25.7-million population, does not have a human rights law at the federal level to deal with racism as a crime. This is unlike the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Britain and other European countries, where there are national laws that punish racist offenders as criminals.
Multi-racial and religious Singapore also has tough laws to deal with racist behaviour, using its Sedition Act on those deemed to have promoted tensions among people of different ethnicities."

While nearly all states and territories – rather than at the national level – had some form of law that makes it a criminal offence to racially vilify a person, these were rarely used, Barns said. In Western Australia, for example, penalties of up to 14 years’ imprisonment can be imposed.
The Racial Discrimination Act allows the Australian Human Rights Commission to take civil action against individuals or institutions for racial abuse through a usually long process of mediation and arbitration. Compensation may be awarded.

Just as we have had a united political front on dealing with Covid-19, we need that same pressure on the issue of racism,” Barns said. “Police need to be on the front foot in using those laws and police commissioners can show leadership on it.”
Another victim of racism, Chinese-Australian driving teacher Tim Usman, echoed Barns’ comments.
“There must be a law for this racism because things are going to get much worse,” he said. “Most people are good but racism must be treated as a criminal offence like all other crimes, otherwise people get away with it. I am so angry, because racism [questions] my identity.”

Barns and various community leaders and support groups all over Australia are now calling for an anti-racism campaign.
There have been several such campaigns in Australia, the last one being “Racism. It Stops With Me” which started in 2012 but ended in 2018.

“The campaign would have been even more effective had it received more material support from the federal government. But during the time I was commissioner, the government was more intent on weakening anti-racism, including the federal laws against racial hatred, than it was in strengthening it,” he said."

It was defeated in 2017.
The call to step up Australia’s anti-racism campaign was important because its human rights “report card” with the UN – the Universal Periodic Review – was due in early 2021, Human Rights Watch said.
The Human Rights Law Centre has already submitted its usual report to the UN on behalf of NGOs in Australia, and among the many recommendations it made, said: “Australia must strengthen measures to combat discrimination and violence on racial, ethnic or religious grounds, particularly through education and dialogue.”
There were no issues with Australia’s last review four years ago, although the UN recommended that Australia strengthen its initiatives in anti-racism, tolerance and non-discrimination.
“Since this pandemic started, we have heard of thousands of instances of racist behaviour directed towards Asian-Australians,” said Mohammad Al-Khafaji, the chief executive of the Federation of Ethnic Communities’ Councils of Australia (Fecca)."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=199","Jun 2, 2020 11:59 AM","MoneyMaker168","“Fecca has also been calling for a government-funded anti-racism strategy and campaign designed to address the rising tide of subtle racism and discrimination in the community.”
Soutphommasane said: “It’s critical that political leaders send a strong message to society about racism not being tolerated.”
The Australian government and the Australian Human Rights Commission said they were doing their part.
While Prime Minister Scott Morrison and other federal leaders have condemned racist incidents, it was not until several incidents were reported by the media that Morrison took firmer action, telling Australians in April to “stop it”.
“Now is a time to support each other and I would remind everyone that it was Chinese-Australians in particular that provided one of the greatest defences we had in those early weeks,” he said, referring to how residents returning from Lunar New Year holiday in China had taken the initiative to isolate themselves at the start of the pandemic.
At the time of publication, Australia had more than 7,000 Covid-19 cases and over 100 deaths.
Race Discrimination Commissioner Chin Tan said the commission had ramped up efforts to help victims report racial offences, translated instruction materials into 64 languages and worked with communities, government, police, researchers and the media to address racism.
Tan wrote a strongly worded article in mainstream media saying there was reason to believe racism was on the rise as a result of a growing threat from violent right-wing extremism as described by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio)."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001430.jsp?ftp=199","Jun 2, 2020 11:59 AM","MoneyMaker168","He quoted Asio’s Director General Mike Burgess saying that “in suburbs around Australia, small cells regularly meet to salute Nazi flags, inspect weapons, train in combat and share their hateful ideology”.
“Violent racism of the kind Burgess warned against does not appear in isolation. It grows out of a mindset that has no regard for multiculturalism, and it thrives in communities that fail to stand up to xenophobia and racism,” Tan said.
“This is why Asio’s security efforts, at the sharp end of combating racism, require the support of a National Anti-Racism Strategy that provides education and promotes social cohesion.”
When asked why the commission would not take a more proactive approach to deterring racism rather than treating it – for example, by advertising stronger penalties for racial offences on mainstream television – it said those efforts, as part of a fresh anti-racism programme, required funding which it had already requested from the government.
TAKING MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS
Meanwhile, Asians in Australia have started taking matters into their own hands, with several community groups starting a reporting service in early April, encouraging people to report all attacks while offering them peer support and counselling.
The group, headed by the advocacy group Asian Australian Alliance, has already received 380 complaints.
In a survey of about 240 of those who reported an incident, more than 80 per cent said they had experienced racism in public places. Forms of attack included slurs such as “stop eating bats and dogs”, physical assault, being spat or sneezed at and being shunned from groups."

Other passengers laughed at the taunts and only one person, a 50-year-old white Australian woman, stood up for him.
In March, a Singaporean and a Malaysian university student from Melbourne University, neither of whom were from China, were verbally abused, beaten, kicked and dragged to the ground on Elizabeth Street, in the Melbourne central business district."

Said Lin, the accountant: “I felt violated for sure. These abuses affect one’s safety and mental wellness. It is traumatising for victims. It is why Chinese-Americans are carrying guns.”
Lin did not believe most Australians were racist but said the government needed to take a tougher stance. “I pay taxes and I contribute to Australia. But my voice is not heard as much as [that of] a person who is not a minority in the Australian society. Chinese-Australians account for only 5 per cent of the nation’s voting power, that’s why politicians don’t care.”
Asian Australian Alliance advocate Erin Chew said many Australians were in denial.
“The prime minister made a public speech about the ‘contributions’ Chinese-Australians had made towards this pandemic but failed to actually acknowledge the elephant in the room, and that was to call the racism what it is: hate crime.”
She said the Human Rights Commission had limited powers.
“As it receives government funding, it still needs to maintain certain objectivity. The race discrimination commissioner is responsible for ‘running the process’ rather than being an activist and speaking out,” Chew said."

Arkadia University’s Sociology, Anthropology, and Criminal Justice professor Alex Otieno, who has written about human rights and racism at the UN, said Asian-Australians had every right to sue the Australian government if things did not improve. This was because their rights had been breached under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination treaty, which Australia signed in 1966, Otieno said.
Whether they would win was another matter.
“There is never precedent until someone has done something,” he said. “They may fail the first time or the second time [but] symbolically the idea that people are going to sue brings the matter to public attention and there is value in that.”
While he would not classify Covid-19-related racism as systemic persecution, unlike other human rights abuses like genocide or those in which governments were complicit, he said rights were still being violated when a country failed to meet its obligations to protect its people."

Asian-Australians also had to be encouraged by the strong voices of other Asian diasporas, such as in the US.
“There is now a large majority of Asians and Asian-Australians who are at least second generation, born and raised [in Australia] and are no longer like the first-generation migrants who adhere to the ‘model minority’ [stereotype] of keeping their heads down,” she said.
“While Covid-19-related racism is not the cause of racism, but more a symptom of the bigger issue of racism in Australia, it effectively has given Asian-Australians courage and the push to speak out against it.”
But she warned things were unlikely to change quickly, given the continued “air” of suspicion of China’s growing influence and “foreign interference” in Australia.
“As ‘racial minorities’ in Australia, when China or any other country in Asia is targeted, the racial backlash falls on Asians and Asian-Australians. A good example is looking at what happened to Gladys Liu when she was elected for the Victorian Federal seat of Chisholm in the last election,” Chew said.
“As soon as she entered parliament, she was already deemed to be somehow ‘colluding’ with China.”
But while big changes may not happen in her lifetime, Chew felt the turning point was now.
“When any community of colour speaks up strongly and creates their own opportunities and platforms to do so, the Australian mainstream society really has no choice but to change with the trajectory,” she said."

An editorial published by official state newspaper People's Daily at midnight on Friday said the building of a fully functioning legal and implementable framework for Hong Kong's national security was “a national matter instead of just a Hong Kong matter”.
“The fact is, Hong Kong has been handed over for nearly 23 years but local legislation [on national security law] has been delayed without progress. Anti-China radicals have used this period of time to frequently challenge the authority of the central government, promoted and encouraged ‘independence’, secession and sedition activities,” the article said.
“In 2019, protests roiled from the anti-extradition bill even showed that anti-China radicals are repeatedly stepping on the bottom line of the security of national sovereignty, challenging central authority and authority of the Hong Kong Basic Law. Violence erupted and riots emerged.
“This has seriously threatened the practice of ‘one country, two systems’ and the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. These are all testimonies of how building a fully functioning legal and implementable framework in Hong Kong is necessary and urgent,” the article said."

Hong Kong’s stocks fell sharply on Friday after Beijing said it plans to pass a security law to curb secession and sedition in the city. The Hang Seng Index slid 2.6 per cent, or 619.47 points, to 23,660.56 right after the open.
The resolution expected later today will add to the confrontation between Beijing and Washington, with US President Donald Trump saying his administration would respond strongly.
“A horrible risk for markets is that much of the attention from today's NPC will turn to Hong Kong. The agenda includes an item that would mean the government will tighten its grip over the special administrative region, which could potentially reignite the protests that wracked the city last year,” said Stephen Innes, a strategist at AxiCorp.
“But even more worrisome is the global backlash, especially with the US-China hawks circling overhead. A denouncement by the White House, which is almost certainly to happen, could exacerbate already tenuous US-China relations and could trigger a global backlash that Trump seems to be pinning his hopes on. Indeed, it is starting to look like a US-China summer of discontent in the making.”
Phase one China-US trade deal to continue
Li vowed the phase one trade deal with the US would be implemented from January. “We need to implement the phase one trade deal with the US,” he said, adding that China was committed to a multilateral trade system and reform of the World Trade Organisation. He also said China would push forward with the China-Japan-South Korea Free Trade Agreement.
According to the phase one deal signed with the US, China pledged to buy, over two years, at least US$200 billion more in American goods and services than it did in 2017, including about US$40 billion in agricultural goods."

Foreign investment
China will “significantly shorten” its negative list for foreign investment as trade tensions with Washington continue, over issues such as market access.
Without referencing specific sectors, Li said the government would draw up a negative list of areas in cross-border trade in services, in which foreigners may not participate. He said, however, that Beijing would seek to ensure a market environment which would allow ""all companies, Chinese and foreign, to be treated as equals and engage in fair competition”.
Rejection of separatist activities in Taiwan
Li called in his address for the resolute rejection of separatist activities seeking Taiwan's independence, and urged a deepening of ties across the Taiwan Strait towards the goal of peaceful reunification.

Li’s remarks echoed those made in last year’s work report, but left off mention of the “1992 consensus” which was included last year.
Taiwan slams national security legislation for Hong Kong
Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council slammed the proposed national security law for Hong Kong, saying it violated the democratic and human rights of the city's people. It said the legislation would increase dissatisfaction and endanger all people in the city, as well as its status as an international financial centre.
“In a reflection of the CCP's inability to self-reflect, it is blindly ignoring the root of Hong Kong’s instability and blaming it instead on external forces and ‘Hong Kong independence’ forces, and is therefore anxious to legislate to be on guard against any national security loopholes,” the council said in a statement.
“The laws of any civilised country should be the protector of the people, not the shackles of freedom,” it said. “We hope the relevant parties will think twice, and not make the wrong decision, to plunge Hong Kong into further chaos."""

The coronavirus has infected more than 5 million people and killed over 320,000 around the world, including 4,645 people in China.
Economic focus
The NPC comes as China continues its re-emergence from the health crisis, but amid widespread criticism of its initial handling of the outbreak and attempts to cover it up.
Some Chinese activists and scholars have even called for the meeting to be a reckoning of Beijing’s response to the pandemic, which has infected more than 5 million people and killed close to 330,000 around the world.
Those appeals are likely to go unanswered, however, as the nation’s leaders are expected to spend the next week or so expounding their policies and proposals for reviving the economy, alleviating poverty and fiscal reform.
Unemployment measures
Li stressed the need to increase jobs support, including for the country's 8.74 million college graduates this year, in the midst of soaring unemployment in China. The Covid-19 pandemic has left tens of millions without work. Several hundred million casual labourers and other low-income earners would be able to postpone their social insurance premiums and employment-related government fees, and the government would provide more vocational training, he said."

“We must be clear that efforts to stabilise employment, ensure living standards, eliminate poverty, and prevent and defuse risks must be underpinned by economic growth; so ensuring stable economic performance is of crucial significance,” the work report continued.
“We need to pursue reform and opening up as a means to stabilise employment, ensure people’s well-being, stimulate consumption, energise the market, and achieve stable growth. We need to blaze a new path that enables us to respond effectively to shocks and sustain a positive growth cycle.”
