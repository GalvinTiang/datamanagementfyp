What is important in the current sentiment?
Vaccine is coming, but I will not listen to Malaysia company that hoo haa say that they got contract. I will sell off my Hexza.
Construction will boom, but I still will sell my Muhibbah, Gkent and Mahsing. This is because the expected Q3 result to drop, so the price will soon follow.
On my trip to Woodlands, I thought that Technology will boom, so I have made the decision to put 98% of my cash into Technology stocks like Dufu, Penta and MPI.
CONCLUSION
SELL
HEXZA | SELL | RM1.47 = RM1470X50=73500
MUHIBBAH | SELL | RM0.83 = RM730X50=41500
GKENT AND MAHSING | SELL | RM0.85 = RM850X50=42500

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas says investors shouldn't overthink the inevitable growth of the EV market with global penetration only at 2% and major automakers fully committed. He notes that the EV industry is growing at a 20% CAGR through 2040, while the internal combustion energy industry will shrink at an estimated 5% CAGR through 2040. Thus, the advice is given to 'take the over' on growth from the 2% mark.
California's big move to ban ICE cars is called notable because the state ranks by itself as the 5th largest GDP market in the world and could accelerate the move of fleets (corporate, logistics, rideshare) into EVs.
Jonas thinks the California announcement sets up well for Aptiv (APTV -2.2%) and Tesla (TSLA -6.0%) in particular. Of course, the list of EV stocks is growing by the day and includes names like Blink Charging (BLNK -4.9%), Arcimoto (FUV -4.0%), Spartan Energy Acquisition (SPAQ -6.5%), Electrameccanica Vehicles (SOLO +7.4%), Delphi Technologies (DLPH -0.8%), Tortoise Acquisition (SHLL -17.3%), Lordstown Motors (RIDE) and Workhorse Group (WKHS -5.7%). Interestingly, many of those names are lower following Tesla's Battery Day event and the high-profile flameout of Nikola (NKLA -17.8%) Executive Chairman Trevor Milton."

“Relative to the mid-point of our guidance, we experienced material improvement in demand across all end markets, but particularly in the Automotive and Mobile end markets,” Kurt Sievers, NXP president and CEO, said in a statement.
The company said it sees revenue for the quarter coming in even with a year ago, at $2.267 billion, vs. previous expectations of a 12% decline. It said non-GAAP operating income for the period will be $586 million compared with previous expectations of $444 million.
The company said it had seen improved demand in both its direct and distribution channels. “The business environment has improved at a faster than anticipated pace, driving a broad-based increase in revenue, which also enabled higher gross margin, Sievers said."

The villagers were very happy, after all there were hundreds of Monkeys in a nearby forest.
They caught the Monkeys and got them to the rich man. He bought hundreds of Monkeys and paid 100 for every Monkey the villagers gave him.
They began to make a living out of getting Monkeys from the forest and selling it to the rich man.
Soon, the forest began to run out of monkeys that were easy to catch.
Sensing this, the rich man offers 200 for every monkey. The villagers were ecstatic.
They went back to the forest, set up traps and caught the monkeys and got them to the rich man.
A few days later, the rich man announced he would pay 300 per monkey.
The villagers began climbing trees and risking their lives to catch monkeys and get them to the rich man – who bought them all.
There were no Monkeys left in the forest!
One day, the rich man announced he would like to buy more monkeys – this time for 800 each.
The villagers couldn’t believe this. They were desperately trying to get more monkeys.
Meanwhile, the rich man said he had to go back to the city on some business work and until he returns his manager would deal on his behalf.
Once he left, the villagers were unhappy. They were making quick and easy money from selling monkeys, but the forest no longer had monkeys.
This is when the manager of the rich man stepped in.
He made an offer the villagers could not refuse.
Pointing out to all the monkeys that the rich man had caged. He told the villagers he would sell the monkeys for 400 each.
“Sell them back to the rich man at 800 each when he comes back” the manager said.
The villagers were over the moon. Buy for 400 and sell for 800 in few days. They had just found the easiest way to double their money.
The villagers collected all their savings and even borrowed money.
There were long queues and within a few hours, almost all the monkeys were sold out.
Unfortunately, their happiness did not last long, as the manager went missing the next day and the rich man never came back.
Many villagers kept the monkeys with them, hoping the rich man would come back. But soon, they lost hope and had to let the monkeys back into the forest as feeding and taking care of the noisy monkeys became extremely difficult.
Good Luck!"

1. Dow Jones future 和 KLSE in bearish trend!
2. 科技龙头的漂亮财无法推高股价，比如apple财报公布后跌最多，收入盈利都创新高，可是股价却向南跌，跌跌不休。
3. Malaysia COVID-19 疫情每况愈下，屡创新高，不久的将来、COVID-19 就在你左右，当你的家人因COVID-19往生，政府还不承认错误，加强MCO，赢了股票，坐满一车车的金银珠宝，输掉自己的家人，你还会开心吗？要知道亡者没得净身，没得穿上喜爱华丽的服装，要以最快的速度将遗体入棺，直接封棺，之后就直接送去火化或下葬，连送最后一程，也只能两三个亲人，因为处于高风险，是不允许太多人送最后一程。况且每个家庭成员都必须去检验，有些还在隔离着。我相信这些种种凄凉和悲哀的过程，我们都不想遇到这样的死亡吧！所以在此提醒大家，COVID-19 真的不是开玩笑的，不要以为不会发生在自己的身上，为了自己、家人、亲友们的安全和健康，没必要真的少出门，千万要记得带好口罩、勤洗手、保持社交距离真的很重要，别再赌股票，赌运气，收割下雨财为上，阿弥陀佛，我们离股灾已不远了。"

(March 7, 2021, 1:24 AM GMT+8 Corrected March 7, 2021, 11:41 AM GMT+8)
President Joe Biden’s signature $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill passed the Senate 50-49 on Saturday following a more than 25-hour marathon of amendment votes completed after Democrats settled an intra-party dispute over unemployment aid.
The measure, the American Rescue Plan Act, now heads back to the House, where Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said a vote will be held Tuesday. Although some House progressives have complained about changes made by the Senate, none so far have threatened to withhold votes. Democrats aim to have it signed into law next week.
Enactment of the second-largest stimulus bill in U.S. history would hand Biden his first legislative victory and set the stage for work this spring on a massive infrastructure and manufacturing recovery bill that he wants.
“As tough as this moment is, there are brighter days ahead -- there really are,” Biden said at the White House after the Senate acted. “It’s never been a good bet to bet against America.”
The bill would provide the biggest health-care expansion since the Affordable Care Act, a temporary plan to slash the child poverty rate and send $1,400 payments soon to millions of Americans. In addition, state and local governments are set to get more than $350 billion in aid and schools would get an infusion of funding, all of which Democrats hope will propel a faster economic recovery long before they face voters in 2022.
It would deliver $300 a week in extra unemployment assistance through Sept. 6 and make the first $10,200 of unemployment insurance benefits non-taxable for households with incomes of less than $150,000. The legislation includes $160 billion for vaccine and testing programs to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. The Senate also adopted a bipartisan amendment from Republican Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia to direct $800 million toward alleviating youth homelessness.
Overall, the legislation is double the size of the Obama-era stimulus and exceeded many earlier Wall Street estimates for how big a package could Democrats pass with the thinest margin of control. It is eclipsed in size only by the $2.2 trillion pandemic aid plan passed a year ago.
The Democratic drive in the Senate stalled out for nearly 12 hours on Friday after Manchin -- a pivotal vote in the 50-50 Senate -- balked at an amendment to extend supplemental unemployment benefits into October.
As Republicans tried to lure Manchin to vote for a proposal by Senator Rob Portman of Ohio that would extend the benefits only through July 18, Democrats from Biden on down furiously lobbied Manchin and reworked their earlier plan to get his support.
Negotiations on that amendment caused a separate vote on minimum wage that set a record for the longest vote in Senate history, dragging on for nearly 12 hours as Democrats tried to keep their caucus united. In the end, the provision was left out of the legislation because of arcane Senate budget rules.
Despite that stumble, passage was a major victory for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who aimed to show that Democrats could wield power despite the 50-50 Senate split.

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000623.jsp?ftp=49","Mar 7, 2021 2:36 PM","Keyman188","U.S. Economy Ready to Surge With Big Stimulus, Fast Vaccines
(March 7, 2021, 2:00 AM GMT+8 Updated on March 7, 2021, 3:41 AM GMT+8)
~ Growth estimates have jumped in light of recent developments
~ Gains may give some pause on massive infrastructure package
With Democrats on the verge of passing an almost $2 trillion stimulus bill and Covid-19 vaccinations moving ahead, the U.S. economic outlook is much sunnier than it looked in early January.
The latest Bloomberg monthly survey of economists shows the annualized pace of growth in the first quarter will be 4.8%, twice as fast as respondents expected just two months ago. For the full year, gross domestic product is projected to rise 5.5%, which would be the fastest since 1984 and is up from January’s estimate of 4.1%.
After January’s key run-off elections in Georgia, where Democrats secured two Senate seats to win slim control of the chamber from Republicans, economists were generally penciling in a pandemic relief package worth around $1 trillion. Democrats stuck together to push through a bill almost double that size; no Republican senators voted for the plan on Saturday. The measure next goes back to the House for a final vote, expected to be Tuesday.
President Joe Biden, speaking Saturday after the Senate vote, looked for a major boost to the economy.
“This will create millions of new jobs,” Biden told reporters at the White House. “It’s estimated over 6 million new jobs by itself; increase the gross domestic product by a trillion dollars.”
“As tough as this moment is, there are brighter days ahead -- there really are,” Biden said. “It’s never been a good bet to bet against America.”
An additional round of $1,400 stimulus checks for millions of Americans, combined with supplemental jobless benefits and the acceleration in vaccinations, should help sustain growth throughout the year, said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC.
Government stimulus will “give a shot of adrenaline for a short period of time,” Stanley said. He noted that “it will kind of fade out, and the more fundamental aspect of things, which is really just opening up and getting back to something closer to the pre-pandemic norm for activity, should kick in.”

(PUBLISHED THU, MAR 11 20216:30 PM ESTUPDATED THU, MAR 11 20216:51 PM EST)
~ President Joe Biden is set to announce that he will direct states to make all adults eligible for the Covid vaccines by May 1.
~ Biden in his first primetime address to the nation is also expected to say that Americans should be able to gather in small groups to celebrate the Fourth of July.
~ The speech comes hours after Biden signed into law the $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill, which he had strongly pushed during his first 50 days in office.
WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden is set to announce Thursday evening that he will direct states to make all adults eligible for the Covid vaccines by May 1.
Biden, in his first primetime address to the nation, is also expected to say that Americans should be able to gather in small groups to celebrate the Fourth of July, a senior administration official told reporters Thursday.
“He will be clear that that does not mean large events where lots of people gather, but it does mean that we can once again have an independence day with small gatherings and celebrations,” the official told reporters ahead of the speech.
“And that’s a big step in the right direction,” the official added. “We believe that if we do our part we’ll be in a much better place by Independence Day, and we can start to resume more of our normal activities.”
Biden’s address is scheduled for just after 8 p.m. ET, and will be broadcast from the East Room of the White House. The speech is expected to last less than 20 minutes.
The primetime event comes hours after Biden signed into law the $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill, which he had aggressively pushed Congress to pass during his first 50 days in office.
Biden’s remarks come as the United States administered a record number of vaccines over the weekend. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention administered 2.9 million vaccines on Saturday, a record, and 2.4 million on Sunday, according to the agency’s latest tally. The numbers are subject to revisions as more data becomes available to public health officials.
Biden is set to embark on a nationwide tour next week to tout the first major legislative accomplishment of his administration. The president will depart Tuesday for Delaware County in Pennsylvania, an electoral swing state that was key to Biden’s victory over former President Donald Trump.
Earlier Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden will “lay out some more specifics” of how the administration will fight the virus moving forward.

Silicon: Semiconductor shortage impacting automotive industry
Posted 19th January 2021 in Industry news.
By Nils Backeberg
According to Reuters, automakers around the world have been caught off-guard by a shortage of semiconductors that has required the industry to compete against the consumer electronics industry for chip supplies. Leading semiconductor manufacturers reassigned capacity from automakers after the pandemic cut down vehicle sales, instead shipping chips to companies that produce smartphones, gaming systems and other electronic goods that remained in high demand.
Several companies, including Volkswagen, Nissan, Ford, Toyota and others, have been impacted and are struggling to secure the chips to maintain production lines. All chips, whether bound for a laptop or a vehicle, start life as a silicon wafer, an industry that has always struggled to keep up with sudden demand spikes.
Roskill View
Polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon) is used in the production of silicon wafers. Polysilicon remains only the third-largest end-use for silicon metal worldwide, however, it has been the fastest growing of the three major applications for silicon metal in the past two decades with its share of global demand rising from 3% in 2000 to 20% in 2019.
Silicon metal is consumed directly in the production of poly-crystalline silicon wafers for use in photovoltaic (PV) solar cells, and indirectly in mono-crystalline silicon wafers for use in semiconductors for integrated circuits and a range of electronic equipment. Until 2007, the production of mono-crystalline silicon wafers for use in semiconductors was the largest end-use for polysilicon. The consumption of silicon metal in polysilicon began to take off significantly after 2009, fuelled in part by generous subsidies for producers and consumers of solar products in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. By 2019, the proportion of global polysilicon demand accounted for by semiconductor applications had fallen to just 16%.
Though Asia accounts for about 70% of global silicon semiconductor wafer output, China remains a relatively small player with a market share of about 15%, in contrast to its dominance of the solar value chain. The leading producing countries are South Korea, Taiwan, the USA and Japan, with over 50% of supply consolidated into the five largest producers.
The rapid advancement of technology both drives and restrains the demand for silicon chips and wafers, and the constantly changing balance of these influences has led to a haphazard growth over the last decade, while silicon wafers in the solar industry have enjoyed a consistent growth. Looking forward, Roskill forecasts that the solar industry will continue to drive growth in demand for silicon metal with double digit increases in demand to 2023. Moreover, while semiconductor demand as a whole is expected to remain in the low single-digit growth rates over the next decade, the impacts of COVID-19 are already indicating a haphazard growth year in 2021."

We value KPower at a discount to the average forward 20x PE of leading renewable energy players globally to reflect: (1) KPower being a relatively new player in this space; and (2) its relatively small market value. No ESG-related adjustments to our fair value based on a 3-star rating as appraised by us (Exhibit 2).
KPower has proposed a private placement of new shares of approximately 10.8% of its outstanding shares or 48.8mil shares at an indicative issue price of RM2.05/share. The RM100mil proceeds from this exercise are mainly earmarked for working capital (i.e. 50MW LSS4 power plant, mini hydropower plants and other upcoming projects).
Based on our estimates, the gross proceeds of RM100.0mil will increase KPower’s net cash position to RM163.5mil (or 25 sen/share) from RM63.5mil (or 10.5 sen/share) as at 31 March 2021.
Meanwhile, based on our calculation, the new shares will dilute its FY23F core EPS by 6% as a 10.8% expansion in the share base more than offset a 2% earnings enhancement arising from interest income (based on an interest rate assumption of 2%). Assuming the deal is to be completed, our fair value shall fall to RM2.33 based on the same valuation basis. We are neutral on this development.
YTD for FY21F (June), KPower has secured jobs worth a total of RM1.2bil, which is still within our annual job wins assumption of RM1.4bil for FY21-23F (vs. KPower’s guidance of RM2.0bil for FY21F). The group’s outstanding construction order book stands at about RM2.0bil.
We continue to like KPower for: (1) the bright prospects of renewable energy, underpinned by the global trends towards clean and sustainable energy and carbon neutrality to combat climate change; and (2) its strong earnings visibility and growth potential underpinned by its RM2.0bil order backlog on green utility projects, coupled with a massive tender book of RM3.4bil.
At about 12x fully-diluted FY23F earnings, we believe that this homegrown renewable energy player has a compelling investment case given its involvement in the green sector where the growth trajectory is just beginning."

Long lead times can prompt chip buyers to build up inventories and even double order, which can exacerbate sales declines later. Mr. Rolland considers lead times above 16 weeks to be in the “danger zone” for chip companies.
Chip makers also could see pressure on their bottom lines as the cost of staying competitive keeps increasing. Micron warned investors earlier this month of an increase in “capital intensity” as it adopts expensive EUV production tools into its manufacturing. And TSMC reported a two-percentage-point decline in its gross margins for the June quarter, citing in part the expense of its latest manufacturing processes. Competition also is spurring dealmaking; The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Intel INTC -1.51% is exploring a deal to buy chip manufacturer GlobalFoundries for around $30 billion.

(SMIC) and Tsinghua Unigroup, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an association of mostly advanced economies. Other countries subsidize semiconductor fabs through cheap land and tax breaks, but only China provides so much aid in the form of this cheap equity, the OECD said.
Whether China’s spending is effective remains controversial. Chinese chip companies remain well behind leading Western competitors. Mr. Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies estimated China has injected between $49 billion and $72 billion into state-owned aircraft maker Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) in a so-far-unsuccessful effort to make it a competitor to Airbus and Boeing.
Even if other countries spent as much as China, they would likely struggle to achieve truly independent supply chains because China dominates so many of the links. When semiconductor chips are fabricated in the U.S. they still must undergo assembly, packaging and testing, a low-margin business where China is the biggest player.

If Mr. Powell isn’t given a new four-year term next February, when his current term expires, the leading contender for the job is Fed governor Lael Brainard, an economist appointed to the board in 2014 by former President Barack Obama.
Mr. Powell and Ms. Brainard have had similar views on monetary policy in recent years, but Ms. Brainard has in recent months argued more forcefully for the Fed to develop a central bank digital currency. Mr. Powell has said he is undecided on whether the risks outweigh the benefits. Ms. Warren has also recently talked up the potential benefits of such a project.
Reappointing Mr. Powell “would be disappointing” for those who care about Mr. Biden’s agenda to address financial regulation, climate change and racial wealth gaps, said Erik Gerding, a senior fellow at Americans for Financial Reform, a nonprofit that argues for tougher financial regulation. “Having Jerome Powell continue would just mean one less vote for sustained and healthy regulation of the banking system.”

Stocks fell following the release of the minutes, and fell again on Thursday.
In an environment where the pandemic could worsen before it gets better, the Fed may feel the need to put more flexibility on the timing of its taper plans. That will be something to look for at the central bank’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., which begins Friday next week. From there it will be a matter of watching what happens with Covid and how households respond. The recent pickup in vaccinations and a return to more mask-wearing and other mitigation efforts might bring the pandemic back under better control by the end of September, for example, in which case the Fed could send a firmer tapering signal.

Economists at Goldman Sachs last week changed their rate-path forecast to show the Fed raising rates from near zero next July, roughly a year earlier than their previous forecast. They expect the Fed will raise rates sooner because the current interval of higher prices will persist into the middle of next year, even though they still expect inflation to fall to 2% by early 2023.

The new variant poses a dilemma for some central banks: Should they simply wait to see its impact, or act pre-emptively?
Major central banks spent much of the year telling investors that the surge in consumer prices would prove temporary. They have dialed back those claims in recent weeks as inflation soared ever higher. Global supply-chain bottlenecks, one cause of higher prices, are now expected to persist through at least the first half of 2022.
“I think there is a concern that inflation isn’t coming back down as quickly as people had felt and central banks need to react,” said Iain Stealey, a portfolio manager with J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
