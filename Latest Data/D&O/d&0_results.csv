-----------------------------------
We expect the Group to continue with its earnings growth trend in 2019 amidst uncertainties over trade tensions between the USA and China and their impact to consumer sentiment, vehicle demand, supply chain and investment plans. As it is, China’s slowdown in vehicle demand which started in July 2018 has accelerated in 4Q2018 on consumer jitters, forcing Chinese car makers to cut vehicle production and purchases including LED in order to clear excessive inventories within the supply chain. This accelerated negative growth rate effectively exposes Dominant to short term risk on its LED exports to China.
Notwithstanding, the Group expects healthy top line growth for 2019. While lower car sales volume and supply chain adjustment may dampen revenue growth in the short term, the medium to long term growth
fundamentals of LED remain intact as the primary demand drivers of automotive LED are the introduction of new LED lighting applications and increased LED adoption as the preferred lighting."

Vehicles sales in China fell 5.2 percent from a year earlier to 2.52 million units in March 2019, following a 13.8 percent decline in the previous month. It was the ninth consecutive annual decrease and the smallest in seven months, as car makers reduced prices to boost sales after Beijing handed out tax cuts to spur consumer spending. Sales of SUVs, sedans and minivans fell 6.9 percent to just over 2 million units while sales of new energy vehicles jumped 85.4 percent to 126 thousand units."

“buy fundamentally strong stocks which are undervalued“.
Undervalued stocks can fetch higher RETURNS.
Why fundamentally strong stocks?
Because fundamentally strong stocks represent those companies which are doing good business. Higher returns are only the result of good business practices.

""imo - it's a decent performance from it's growth perspective. the revenue growth continues to outpaced profit growth which implies a sustainable growth despite the political and economic headwinds. the top line performance of automotive segment grew 4.3% in the first 6 months of 2019 which implies it's gaining market share. bear in mind that the automotive lighting business is expected to grow at 7-8% cagr. for D&O annual revenue yoy showing a 3.12% cagr since 2014 ($421M) until 2018 ($491M).
as the first half has shown a 4.3% growth and assuming D&O is able to end the fiscal year (2 more quarters to go) with a 3% revenue growth compared to 2018, that will bring it to $505M total revenue which will then implies a 3.08% cagr. Looks decent to me based on an industry with a single digit cagr projection. there is also signs that inventory is coming down in accordance to market demand. on the other hand, other automotive LED like OSRAM is seeing a negative trend in revenue development :)
from the financial perspective, gross profit came in flat at $62M and gross profit margin at 27.1% versus 27.4% on lower capacity utilization. the group generated positive $41.7M cash flow from it's operations before changes in working capital. at the same time, $34.3M capex and $8.3M div payout resulting in negative fcf of $32M. the mgmt indicates reduction in working capital and renovation of new factory is on schedule with support function to move into new building by end of 2019."""

KUALA LUMPUR (Oct 11): The Government is giving grants to incentivise businesses to automate and digitalise their businesses.
Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng today announced various initiatives and incentives for the development of “digital applications, digital companies, and digital Malaysians” in the National Budget 2020.
This is on top of the five-year National Fiberisation and Connectivity Plan (NFCP) announced earlier, which will be undertaken via a public-private partnership approach involving a total investment of RM21.6 billion.
In his speech in Parliament when tabling the national Budget, Lim said the Government is allocating RM550 million in smart automation matching grants to 1,000 manufacturing and 1,000 services companies to automate their business processes. This grant will be given on a matching basis up to RM2 million per company.
Electrical and electronics (E&E) companies that invest in knowledge-based services, will get a tax exemption for up to 10 years. There is also a special investment allowance for existing E&E companies that have had their reinvestment allowance expired.
In addition, the first 100,000 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) may receive a 50% matching grant of up to RM5,000 a company, for the subscription of digital services for business operations, such as electronic Point of Sale systems (e-POS), Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) and electronic payroll systems.
To seed Malaysian companies to ride the global 5G wave, Guan Eng said the government is budgeting a 5G ecosystem development grant of RM50 million.
Besides, an RM25 million contestable matching grant fund has been proposed to spur more pilot projects on digital applications, such as drone delivery, autonomous vehicles and blockchain technology, to leverage on Malaysia’s fibre optics and 5G infrastructure.
Guan Eng said tax deductions will be given on companies’ contributions towards the newly coined Digital Social Responsibility (DSR), which is the commitment by businesses to contribute to digital economic development while improving digital skills of the future workforce.
A budget of RM100 million will be allocated to Malaysian Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC), the bulk of which (RM70 million) will be for the setting up of 14 one-stop digital enhancement centres in all States.
The setting up of the centres, as an extension of the ‘100 Go Digital’ programme, is to facilitate access to financing and capacity building of businesses, especially the SMEs, in line with the fourth industrial revolution (IR4.0).
The Government also intends to continue providing funds of RM10 million to MDEC to train micro-digital entrepreneurs and technologists, and another RM20 million to grow local champions in creating digital content, especially in e-Games, animation, and digital arts.
Qualified Malaysians aged 18 and above with annual income less than RM100,000 will get a one-time RM30 digital stimulus, to significantly boost the use of e-wallets given the low adoption of e-wallet at 8% as at January. This will cost the government a total of RM450 million.
Meanwhile, e-Sports will receive an increased allocation of RM20 million in 2020, said the Minister."

2QFY20 core PATAMI came in at RM0.7m (-89% YoY; -73% QoQ), bringing 1HFY20 core PATAMI to RM4.6m (-62% YoY). While only representing 15% of both our and consensus estimates, we deem it to be in line as we believe the worst is over and expects a far superior performance in the 2H. The group has recovered to full capacity in June and is seeing strong orders owing to pent-up demand from China car sales which has staged growth for four consecutive months, while Europe is seeing encouraging rebound in car sales. Maintain OUTPERFORM with higher TP of RM0.965.
Within expectations. 2QFY20 core PATAMI came in at RM0.7m (-89% YoY; -83% QoQ), bringing 1HFY20 core PATAMI to RM4.6m (-62% YoY). While the numbers only represent 15% of both our and consensus estimates, we deem it to be in line as we believe the worst is over and expects the a far better performance in the 2H as the group regain full operations.
YoY, revenue for 1HFY20 fell 9% to RM207.4m as the group was largely impacted by the movement control order (MCO) where it was limited to 20% workforce followed by a gradual increase to 50%. This has caused some inefficiencies due to underutilised production space during the period which resulted in lower gross profit margin of 25% vs. 27% in 1HFY19. QoQ, PATAMI fell 83% on a 25% decline in revenue. The large decline can be explained by the impact of MCO which was mostly felt in the 2Q as compared to the 1Q.
Better 2H. We believe that the worst is over for D&O and expects a significantly better 2H with subsequent quarters to see continuous QoQ growth. The group has recovered to full capacity in June and is seeing strong orders owing to pent-up demand from China automotive market as well the Europe automotive market. China being the first to curb the Covid-19 spread has staged a V-shaped recovery in automotive sales and has also marked its fourth consecutive monthly growth as sales rose 16.4% YoY in July, raising expectation that the slump in auto sales could be ending. Over in Europe, car sales have also displayed encouraging recovery coming off the low of -76% YoY in April to -22% YoY in June, thanks to the lifting of restrictions and attractive rebates. We also noted that both regions are experiencing increasing demand for electric vehicles, in line with government policies to reduce carbon emission.
LED per vehicle is expected to increase as car markers emphasis more on electric vehicles and driverless vehicles. As one of the pioneers of smart RGB, D&O is well positioned to reap the benefits as car makers adopt such technology. Smart RGB allows for local dimming which results in better contrast and lower power consumption. This works in favour with electric vehicles which are dependent on battery for its driving range.
Maintain FY20E and FY21E core PATAMIs of RM29.9m and RM42.9m, respectively. We believe the current quarter to be the bottom of a U-shape recovery and expects a strong 2H to pick up the pace.
Maintain OUTPERFORM with a higher Target Price of RM0.965 based on higher 25.3x FY21E (previously 22.6x), in line with its 3-year mean to reflect improving prospects ahead as the worst quarter is over. Being a renowned brand name in full range automotive LED, we believe D&O is a prime proxy for the potential recovery in the automotive market.
Risks to our call include: (i) disruption of components supply, (ii) replacement/obsolescence of LED technology, (iii) adverse currency fluctuations, and (iv) adverse foreign labour policy

Stock : D&O Price Target : 2.00 | Price Call : BUY
Last Price : 1.49 | Upside/Downside : +0.51 (34.23%)

Upgrade TP to RM2.00 (32% upside). D&O delivered an alltime high quarterly earnings as 3QFY20 PATAMI came in at RM14.7m (+63.4% YoY), bringing 9MFY20 core PATAMI to RM19.3m (-8% YoY). While only representing 57%/60% of our/consensus estimates, we deem it to be in line as we expect back-to-back record earnings in the subsequent 4Q. D&O is experiencing pent-up demand from China car sales as well as strong orders from Europe. We raise FY20E/21E earnings by 10%/19% to account for more design wins coupled with the gradual adoption of its smart RGB which is more lucrative than the standard RGB. Maintain OUTPERFORM with a higher Target Price of RM2.00.
Within expectations. D&O delivered an all-time high earnings as 3QFY20 PATAMI came in at RM14.7m (+63.4% YoY), bringing 9MFY20 PATAMI to RM19.3m (-8% YoY). While only representing 57%/60% of our/consensus estimates, we deem it to be in line as we expect its record breaking feat to continue in the upcoming 4Q.
YoY, revenue for 9MFY20 inched 3.5% higher to RM366.8m despite being plagued by the movement control order (MCO). This was possible due to new business wins (thanks to improved customer’s acceptance of the group’s product) as well as a surge in demand from existing customers. This led to a PATAMI of RM19.3m, narrowing the YoY gap to 8%. QoQ, 3QFY20 revenue jumped 78.2% as PATAMI came in at RM14.7m (vs. RM0.7m in 2Q) as the group is back to full operations.
Back-to-back record earnings incoming. Going into 4QFY20, we expect the group to continue the QoQ growth trend. Essentially, we are forecasting a 7.7% YoY growth for FY20E PATAMI, despite the global pandemic. The group is experiencing a surge in orders from China automotive market with robust demand extending the car sales trajectory on a 7-month growth streak, with Oct recording 9.3% growth YoY. Electric vehicle sales in China grew at a faster pace of 104% YoY in Oct.
LED per vehicle is expected to increase as car makers emphasize more on electric vehicles and driverless vehicles. As one of the pioneers of smart RGB, D&O is well positioned to reap the benefits as car makers adopt such technology. Smart RGB allows for local dimming, resulting in better contrast, and lower power consumption which is a vital utility attribute for electric vehicles to extend their driving range.
Raise FY20E and FY21E core PATAMIs to RM37.6m and RM63.8m, respectively. We expect another record quarter in the subsequent 4Q and a 70% growth in FY21.
Maintain OUTPERFORM with a higher Target Price of RM2.00 (previously RM1.20) based on higher 35x FY21E PER (previously 25.3x), at +1.5SD to its 3-year mean to reflect improving prospects ahead. Being a renowned brand name in full range automotive LED, we believe D&O is a prime proxy to the potential boom in the automotive market.
Risks to our call include: (i) disruption of components supply, (ii) replacement/obsolescence of LED technology, (iii) adverse currency fluctuations, and (iv) adverse foreign labour policy.

downupdownup : IMO deals with tesla will be short-lived.
sure, if it is true then they can make money for the time being.
but tesla's vision is to push down their costs, and elon musk has a reputation for vertical integration. sooner or later they'll make their LEDs themselves. not that hard for them to do, and they have been moving more items in-house. other car manufacturers will follow suit to lower their costs so they can compete in prices.

Most of D&O's revenue comes from Asia, which i believe China is the main stream of D&O revenue. However, China local chip supply chain is vulnerable, and this condition might last for the next six months.
In long term, the automotive lightning market is expected to grow at 5-8 % CAGR and the LED segment is expected to grow at 10% CAGR. EV and most of the conventional car will be using LED lightning system in the future.
as for the valuation of D&O, the counter is trading at the price of RM 2.59 as for today and i believe it is slightly overvalue. The valuation method i am using is the PEG method. I assumed the FPE of D&O will be around 40, and the growth rate will be the CAGR of the LED market which is 10. the PEG of D&O will be 4. However, D&O business might be growing at a higher rate (more than 10). thus i believe this counter is slightly overvalue.
as for the technical analysis, i agree that RM2.56 is a support level. for those who entered above RM2.56, it is important to set your cut loss and follow your trading plan strictly. for those who entered at a relatively low price, it is okay to hold your position. Personally, i will not take profit based on the price of the stock. instead i will take profit but using a method called trailing stop loss"

However as automotive electronics is expected to be the fastest growing market in the semiconductor industry in the near future ( semiconductor content per car will grow from US$300 to US$600 by 2022 according to Pentamaster Chairman Chuah Choon Bin) and as smartphones market face over-saturation,semiconductor players will be emphasizing on the upcoming lucrative market for automotive semiconductor sector.

They are selling the software at high price.
I did a study and it is fake as it is just using a special way detect momentum. It is not MACD, it is a improved MACD with almost no lagging.
I have the formula but won't reveal as it is fake indicator.
When many people are using the same fake indicator, it is causing the market surge on some stocks for the past few month.
The fake indicator will cause people to buy stocks that have gone up a lot. They treat ""gone up a lot"" as buying from ""big hand""."

TheEdge Thu, Feb 25, 2021 11:24am - 22 minutes ago
KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 25): D&O Green Technologies Bhd shares rose to a record high after the group delivered all-time high earnings.
D&O, which is among the top 10 gainers, rose as much as 46 sen or 13.81% to a high of RM3.79 today.
At 11.04am, the counter pared some gains at RM3.75, still up 42 sen or 12.61%.
The group announced yesterday that its net profit surged 119% to RM30.32 million for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2020, from RM13.85 million in the previous year’s corresponding quarter, benefiting from increased demand and recovery in the automotive industry.
Its revenue for the quarter also grew 39% to RM209.57 million from RM150.47 million a year earlier.
For the full year, its net profit rose 42% to RM49.65 million from RM34.87 million in the preceding year, while revenue climbed 14% to RM575.78 million from RM504.31 million.
Analysts have raised D&O earnings forecasts after its earnings beat their expectations.
Public Invest Research’s analyst Chong Hoe Leong said in a note today D&O’s FY20 core earnings surpassed his and consensus expectations, coming in at 134% of house and 125% of street expectations, respectively.
He said the sterling results were mainly driven by strong post-pandemic global auto sales recovery coupled with higher adoption of automotive LED for exterior lighting and infotainment.
“In view of its increasing global market share especially in the exterior LED segment and its leading technology position in the smart RGB LED, we bump up our FY21-23 earnings forecasts by 50%-100%,” he said.
Chong, who maintained an ""outperform"" call on the stock, also raised D&O's target price to RM5.09 (from RM1.88), after rolling forward its valuation base year to FY22, based on a higher price to earnings ratio of 45 times (from 40 times).
Kenanga Research’s analyst Samuel Tan also said in a note today the group’s numbers exceeded his/consensus full-year estimates by 20%/34%.
“We expect product demand to remain elevated in FY21, fuelled by the continuation of strong car sales and increased adoption of interior and exterior LEDs,” he said.
He raised D&O FY21 profit after tax and minority interests (PATAMI) by 23% to RM100.5 million and introduced FY22 PATAMI of RM121.9 million. The forecast represented growth of 102% and 21%, respectively.
Tan, who maintained ""outperform"" on the stock, raised D&O target price to RM4.20 from RM3.40, based on 48 times FY21 price earnings ratio to reflect improving prospects ahead.
“Being a renowned brand name in full range automotive LED, we believe D&O is a prime proxy to the potential boom in the automotive market,” he added."

TheEdge Thu, Feb 25, 2021 12:12pm - 12 minutes ago
（吉隆坡25日讯）D&O Green Technologies Bhd收益创史上新高，提振股价刷新纪录。
D&O今早上涨46仙或13.81%，至3.79令吉，成为十大上升股之一。
截至早上11时04分，该股回落至3.75令吉，扬42仙或12.61%。
该集团昨日宣布，截至2020年12月31日第四季净利剧增119%至3032万令吉，上财年同季为1385万令吉，得益于汽车业提高需求与复苏。
季度营业额也上升39%至2亿957万令吉，一年前为1亿5047万令吉。
全年净利弹升42%至4965万令吉，上财年报3487万令吉，营业额则增加14%至5亿7578万令吉，之前为5亿431万令吉。
D&O的收益超出分析界预期，促使分析员调高其收益预测。
大众投资研究分析员Chong Hoe Leong今日在报告中表示，D&O的2020财年核心收益超出其与其他券商预期，分别达134%及125%。
他表示，业绩走强主要受到全球汽车销售强劲复苏的推动，加上越来越多人把汽车LED用于外部照明和信息娱乐系统。
“有鉴于此，我们把2021财年至2023财年收益预测大幅度调高50%至100%。”
Chong维持给予该股的“超越大市”评级，并把目标价上调至5.09令吉（之前为1.88令吉）。"

Note markets are 6-12 months forward looking (see Gloves). Therefore, latest by 2Q21 (Apr-Jun) we should see share prices pop back to at least pre-pandemic levels

Meanwhile, retailer chips was gradually increasing from 4% to around 5%, meaning the lack of buying momentum has forced retailers to sell off. However, stochastic oscillator did indicate oversold position and seemed to be treading upwards to form potential golden cross in the next few days. Unless there is increased selling pressure from retailers or bankers continue to reduce their buying momentum in coming days, the positive sign points to a strong possibility of downtrend reversal soon."

In a Facebook post, Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz said the country’s economic growth and the fate of the vulnerable group should not be sacrificed in Malaysia’s efforts in combating Covid-19.
PETALING JAYA: The rising Covid-19 cases in Selangor are putting the government in a limbo as it may soon be forced to seek a balance between lives and livelihood.
A full-fledged movement control order (MCO) for the state that is being considered by the Health Ministry is bound to lead to economic stress and the aftermath cleanup will be another major hurdle.
As Malaysia’s most developed state, Selangor is the largest contributor to Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) at around 24%.
MIDF Research economist Mazlina Abdul Rahman said the projected daily output loss to Malaysia’s economy due to a full-scale MCO would be around RM500mil to RM600mil."

""Further out, the big uncertainty is how fast economies will decarbonize. The quicker it happens, the greater the risk of write-downs for companies that continue to drill, and the better the chances that low-carbon bets pay off. “The energy system of the next two to three decades will be the most diverse in history. All the numbers are fluid,” says Oswald Clint, an analyst at Bernstein.
Rapid declines in carbon emissions would reward the oil and gas producers trying to lead the transition, such as Shell, which has invested in renewable power, biofuels, carbon capture and hydrogen. Based on various aggressive scenarios for global carbon reductions, Mr. Clint estimates that Shell could be worth between 20% and 58% more.
As shareholders push public oil giants to reconsider big new fossil fuel projects, national oil producers have an opportunity. Depending on the pace of decarbonization, it might be golden or just a mirage.""

Jain is so good that warren couldn't afford to lose him.

HOW MKT WORKS SERIES
stock investing is like doing good happening biz.
only stocks with great biz model for the entire WORLD MKT currently will do well.
Read newspaper to catch the theme.play early, like glove.theme stocks in March 2020.
as cyclical investors, we use skills of talent scout to seek n find the top scorers of the mkt.
only with these chosen stocks by FF, we can CAGR 20 to 50% per cycle.
nice to know we have 2 to 4 cycles p.a.
3 classes of stocks
Pure FA stocks with increasing QR PAT
a. 1st class FA stocks ( 70% of total portfolio )
funds esply FF must play stocks every cycle. Select stocks chosen for MSCI indexes n stocks with mkt cap > rm1.5 billion
go with pure FA stocks that FF will go for, i.e. stocks PAT > $60 million min p.a n fast growing..
FF will make it the happening purebull... with lasting high stock prices for everyone to sell well.
b. 2nd class FA stocks ( 15% of total portfolio )
these r smaller co played n price controlled by 2 to 4 local funds.
xtra care needed. when stock prices peaked, the selldown is madness bcos these funds r expert in selling.
c. play with PnD SYNDICATED stocks ( 15% or less of total portfolio )
usually those failed stocks with huge losses will fly high n super fast bcos the owners n syndicates can only robe big money from retail players.
sympathy stocks to major stocks in theme.play, with no trend of increasing QR PAT r dicey too.
play for a fast game n avoid them if u miss. the ending of PnD stocks r very swift n ugly.
Position well n fully at the new beginning of each new cycle.
if right, hold for the entire cycle n then harvest at right.timing.
never overstay!
Attempt to catch n harvest 1 cycle perfectly, then u know how to repeat n duplicate the same CAGR methodology to next cycle.."

(SMIC) and Tsinghua Unigroup, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an association of mostly advanced economies. Other countries subsidize semiconductor fabs through cheap land and tax breaks, but only China provides so much aid in the form of this cheap equity, the OECD said.
Whether China’s spending is effective remains controversial. Chinese chip companies remain well behind leading Western competitors. Mr. Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies estimated China has injected between $49 billion and $72 billion into state-owned aircraft maker Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) in a so-far-unsuccessful effort to make it a competitor to Airbus and Boeing.
Even if other countries spent as much as China, they would likely struggle to achieve truly independent supply chains because China dominates so many of the links. When semiconductor chips are fabricated in the U.S. they still must undergo assembly, packaging and testing, a low-margin business where China is the biggest player.

If Mr. Powell isn’t given a new four-year term next February, when his current term expires, the leading contender for the job is Fed governor Lael Brainard, an economist appointed to the board in 2014 by former President Barack Obama.
Mr. Powell and Ms. Brainard have had similar views on monetary policy in recent years, but Ms. Brainard has in recent months argued more forcefully for the Fed to develop a central bank digital currency. Mr. Powell has said he is undecided on whether the risks outweigh the benefits. Ms. Warren has also recently talked up the potential benefits of such a project.
Reappointing Mr. Powell “would be disappointing” for those who care about Mr. Biden’s agenda to address financial regulation, climate change and racial wealth gaps, said Erik Gerding, a senior fellow at Americans for Financial Reform, a nonprofit that argues for tougher financial regulation. “Having Jerome Powell continue would just mean one less vote for sustained and healthy regulation of the banking system.”

China EV Forecast: 50% EV Market Share By 2025
https://cleantechnica.com/2019/02/24/china-ev-forecast-50-ev-market-sh...-1/
RECHARGEABLE BATTERY will be the largest biz in our world.
Tech stocks in its power mgmt will do very well too.
Prof Dyson is 1st to sell vacuum cleaner using rechargeable battery. Its price is super high, 10 X the regular type n yet the demand is so good.
this is unbelievable world we r all into.
Huge endless demand is coming from:
EV n
ES simultaneously for solar n wind Energies Storage.
Drones, phones n all the Consumer Electronics products etc,,,
Cobalt is best metal but v limited in supply on earth. the biggest supply comes from Congo, an unstable country that could cause trouble to EV.Economy.
Lots of researches r on going with combination of metals.
Silicon is top on the list as its raw material is found abundantly everywhere on earth.
Downside is Si expands 3 times on recharging.
Scientists r using Si nano.tech but still need to perfect the processes for fast charging, long lasting n safety.
Stocks doing EV.METAL n EV.MATERIAL biz will all become giant co in a shortest time frame!"

these simply mean EV is gaining very fast momentum in biz, = Vol X Velocity.
EV on the road now is only < 5% n expected to rise to 50% n perhaps 80% by year 2030.
Tesla, TSLA is the distinct mkt leader in EV after building a mega factory in c i n a.
This stock is richly rewarded by the stock mkt at a whopping mkt cap of US$773 billion now.
It made the owner the world # 1 richest = a proven fact that EV works wonder.
The above news indicated that the grand old big branded names in auto have awaken.
They r having big plans to go 100% EV = the current chip shortage is due to their sudden huge demand.
MY READ IS :
EV n ES material n metal stocks will do extremely well supplying to old n new auto names.
At < 5% EV on the road:
Stocks like D&O, PMETAL n soon PMBTECH r edi doing so well.
What happen to these stocks, IF there r 50% EV by 2025-30 ?
a. A mid size EV.CAR uses about 200 kg of aluminum which needs silicon as hardener. what about truck, lorry, bus etc.
b. The EV.Battery pack is the heaviest item on the car.
Latest news said SILICON would be used. Importantly, as its raw material is found abundantly on earth.

Once the issue of chip shortage is solved probably in 2023, EV should still need more D&O products."

once again, tesla broke records and exceeded expectations for the quarter. but, its third-quarter earnings call was quite different this time around. as expected, there was no commentary from company ceo elon musk. instead, cfo zachary kirkhorn helmed the call with input from top execs. even without colorful soundbites from musk, there was plenty of surprising news.
above: growth for tesla is being led by the company's newest suv, the model y (source: evannex; photo by casey murphy)
kirkhorn's style, in contrast to musk, is more subdued. he's a matter-of-fact, no-nonsense numbers guy. when asked what's driving tesla's growth right now, kirkhorn noted that tesla ""completed the transition of our shanghai factory as our main export hub."" giga shanghai is shipping cars to europe and asia and that's helping supercharge growth for the company.
around the globe, kirkhorn says, ""the great thing that we're seeing in the space right now is there appears to just be quite a profound awakening of the desirability for electric vehicles. and i mean, to be totally frank, it's caught us a little bit off guard... folks want to buy an electric car and folks want to buy a tesla right now. it's very exciting for us.""
however, with all the pent-up demand, there remains supply chain concerns and production constraints. according to kirkhorn, ""we are putting an extreme effort to build as many cars as we possibly can. it's hard to overstate how extreme the efforts are. it's quite the grind. we're trying as hard as we can to maximize that capacity and to be able to meet the demand that we're receiving. but the net-net of all of this is that we're not able to increase production capacity fast enough.""
""our backlogs are continuing to grow and average customer wait times are extending,"" notes kirkhorn. he added that if someone orders a tesla, the wait time ""could be a couple of months, [or it] could be a couple of quarters.""
so how can tesla take advantage of all this demand? in short, the company has to quickly ramp production at tesla's new gigafactories in texas and germany. according to kirkhorn, ""it remains our target in both austin and berlin to be able to build our first production cars before the end of the year... [and] it's possible that we're spending the bulk of next year working on ramping these factories.""
big picture — what's the forecast ahead? according to kirkhorn, ""our goal is to get to millions of cars per year over the next couple of years and then ultimately, in the long term, be able to achieve 20 million cars per year. we're going to grow as quickly as is feasibly possible with an eye toward a 50% annual growth rate.""

KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 24): D&O Green Technologies Bhd's net profit increased 26% to RM18.6 million for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2021 (3QFY21), from RM14.73 million a year earlier, on strong demand for automotive LED.
Revenue increased 10% to RM174.57 million from RM158.86 million, the group's bourse filing showed.
The group said that while its factory was shut down for 24 days, from July 8 to July 18 and Aug 9 to Aug 23, to curb the spread of Covid-19, it still managed to record revenue growth, supported by strong growth in global automotive LED demand and progressive commercialisation of new business wins.
Its performance was also supported by better cost management and production efficiency improvements, which were partly offset by higher administrative expenses incurred in the implementation of Covid-19 preventive measures.
D&O said it also benefitted from the reversal of the over provision of 2020 income tax expense during the quarter.
For the cumulative three quarters ended Sept 30, 2021, D&O's net profit surged 272% to RM71.89 million, from RM19.33 million a year ago, while revenue jumped 61% to RM588.87 million from RM366.21 million.
Looking ahead, the group expects a strong sequential rebound in sales revenue and profit in the last quarter of FY21, adding that its 90% subsidiary Dominant Opto Technologies Sdn Bhd's expanded capacity has been fully booked for the quarter.
""All employees have completed two doses of vaccination under the MITI PIKAS programme. On Nov 11, 2021, Dominant kicked off the booster vaccination programme (third dose).
""The completion of the vaccination programme, coupled with robust internal Covid-19 preventive measures in place, is expected to substantially reduce the risk of further production disruption,"" it said.
D&O's share price fell six sen or 1.01% to RM5.87, giving the group a market capitalisation of RM7 billion."

The new variant poses a dilemma for some central banks: Should they simply wait to see its impact, or act pre-emptively?
Major central banks spent much of the year telling investors that the surge in consumer prices would prove temporary. They have dialed back those claims in recent weeks as inflation soared ever higher. Global supply-chain bottlenecks, one cause of higher prices, are now expected to persist through at least the first half of 2022.
“I think there is a concern that inflation isn’t coming back down as quickly as people had felt and central banks need to react,” said Iain Stealey, a portfolio manager with J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
