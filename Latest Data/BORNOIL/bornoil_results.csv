"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001255.jsp?ftp=399","Feb 21, 2019 1:12 PM","commonsense","Reading the commentaries in this forum, I think some people still think that the company profit is highly dependent on gold price/ outlook. It’s actually no longer the case.
The company main revenue comes from their F&B business, SugarBun and Pezzo. However, a big chunk of the profit actually comes from the limestone business. Gold division only contributes around RM700k of revenue in the 1Q19 (from its operation in Bukit Ibam, Pahang). In 2Q19, total gold mine is only around RM600k (based on the monthly mining report to Bursa).
The rest of the mining revenue, amounting to more than RM3mil in 1Q19 was actually from the sales of limestone which is also the main contributor to the profit of the group. Limestone in general is used to manufacture building materials like cement, mortar and concrete. So, given that the company’s profit is highly correlated to the sales of limestone which depends on the demand for building material, we can actually deduce that Borneo Oil is actually highly correlates with the construction or property industries rather than the gold mining industry.
In 1Q19, the company sales of limestone drop substantially to only 101,00 MT compared to 4Q18 sales of 435,000 MT, a drop of more than 75%. Sales of limestone is expected to be low at least until the return of upcycle for the construction industry (which might not be in the near term). With this in mind, investors need to be prepared for the company to continuously post low profit in FY19.
If you are looking to diversify your portfolio outside of Borneo Oil (due to its weak earnings outlook) I would recommend you to look at MBMR. (https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/stk/pt/5983.jsp)
MBMR is a direct proxy to Perodua via its 22.6% interest in the company. Valuation is cheap at only 7.0x PE (based on target FY18 profit of RM145mil. 9m profit is already RM106mil). PB is low at only 0.7x BV. 4Q18 results (which should be out by next week) is expected to be higher than 3Q18 and last year's 4Q17.
FY19 growth will be driven by the still high demand of the new Myvi and the newly launched SUV Aruz and also the newly revamp Alza in 2H19. The recent announcement of closure and potential disposal of the loss-making alloy wheel manufacturing business alone is expected to boost the company’s profit by an additional RM20mil. I am projecting a profit to shareholder of RM170 mil for FY19 which at the current price values MBMR at only 6.0x PE.
Please go through the analyst reports and do your own analysis before making any decisions. There are 8 analysts in total covering the stock with most of them having a TP of above RM3 (all have a buy rating). The average TP for the 8 analysts is around RM3.50.
Good luck."

It has been using its good money buying back shares for many months and what interests me was Friday's all out buyback of 4.6 million shares in one go. This shows that the Company knows and is ready to add shareholders' wealth in the near future. All the buyback becomes more aggressive in the midst of entry of major corporate man Datuk Freddy Lim as major shareholder in July 2019 with the acquisition of 55.55 million shares. He now holds near 6 % shares. Also another well known corprate lawyer Datuk Joseph Lee Yok Min acquired nearly 120 million shares in March 2019. and is appointed as Executive Director. All these tells me that all these major shareholders will play key role in its corporate and business plan to add shareholers' wealth. And that is the key reason we see substantial buy back by the Company and well known corporate personalities. By the way recent announcement also see the Company bringing up the fair values of its properties.. is to reflect the true worth of the Group. Normally such exercise will probably lead to more corporate news in future in relation to asset restructuring plans. We can see the support share price is 4.5 sen....and it true worth is at least 13 sen. There was recent significant impairment of operating assets and is a clear sign to clean and clear the operating base probably for new corporate plans. I personally believe .. it is the right time to start monitor this counter ... as Indonesia plans to relocate it's capital city from Jakarta to Kalimantan. All the best to shareholders of Bornoil."

As from today, I think the number of shares traded will become very active and price could probably hit 6 c. If this happens, probably we deserve some good corporate news. No joke.

The Management is evaluating all options available for optimal production arrangements to extract the gold ores which will contribute positively to the Group in the foreseeable future."

Interesting data relating to Malaysia’s mineral reserves:
Tin 1.3 million tonnes @USD17,000-00/tonne / RM72,000-00/tonne
Bauxite 169.8 million tonnes @USD30 (RM128)/tonne
Copper: 5.85 million tonnes @USD5,646.00/M.ton USD4.86/Kg / RM24,000-00/tonne
Gold: 115 million tonnes @USD1700.00/oz / RM236,000/Kg / RM236/g ; Note: 1 oz=31.5g
Iron ore: 498.6 million tonnes @USD103.00/M.ton / RM440-00/tonne
Nickel 75 million tonnes; @USD12,503.00/M.ton / RM53,000-00/tonne
Manganese, 5.7 million tonnes @USD280.00/M.ton / RM1200-00/tonne
Err … *limestone: approx USD35**/RM150-00/tonne
* Borneo Oil & Gas Corp Sdn Bhd acquired a 5.38ha quarry in Lahad Datu, Sabah, for RM47mil last year ..Monday, 20 Jan 2020 the Star newspaper”Borneo Oil Bhd has been engaged as the main limestone aggregates supplier to an integrated limestone processing plant..” ** High quality Crushed limestone aggregate from Malaysia US$10.00 - US$20.00 / Ton | 5000 Ton/Tons (Min. Order) ~ Source: Alibaba.com
The proceeds of RM47 Million raised from proposed placement ..I am not entirely sure prices of limestone / granite in Sabah but presume it should be around the price of Bauxite. But Sabah, or for that matter Peninsular Malaysia still has many mineral resources that justifies for explorations/mineralisation. Say, dollar to dollar - I would rather spend same amount of time/effort/ monies to exploit potentialities in finding 1g of Au which may worth RM240-00/g, i.e. roughly equivalent to 2 metric tonnes (2,000,000g) of limestone.
Further, amid the chaotic state of excessive issuance of USD during the pandemic crises, I am equally certain gold may have greater potential to go higher but I have reservation over limestone prices can be comparable in its mid/long term outlook:

b. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOpcu3ZZNPw
c. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRksWPQRcq0
Conclusion: you may ignore what I said, as I have a strong sense the Company may also has something under their sleeves by witnessing its recent oscillating movement of trading volumes/prices. So, I have accumulated some, both mother & warrants hehe ...."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001255.jsp?ftp=417","Jul 8, 2020 2:59 PM","kakaman","I read a lot of anger in the forum. It is a funny B.OIL has implemented another round of ESOS again: as last ESOS, seen “eligible persons” had exercise 747,966,000 ESOS options @9 Sen and presumably they were old as its shares hit beyond 25sen briefly in 2015. Undeniably, “overwhelming response for its 2015 rights issue* has a lot to do with investors’ confidence towards Sabah diversified conglomerate, H.Seng Group during the last corporate exercise. But it h urts many.
* Note: 2.373 billion rights shares at an issue price of RM0.10 per rights share on the basis of 6 rights shares for every 1 existing B.Oil share held, together with up to 1.186 billion free Warrants C on basis of 1Warrant-C for every 2 rights shares subscribed, in total RM231.52 million was raised).
B.Oil share price has been traded for most part of 2019 between 4~5 sen, with year 2020 came down to low of 1 sen on mid-March, 2020 which almost wiping off 90% of its value from the right issue price. The circular I received stating the ESOS shall based on announcement of proposal @ RM0.0221, an average discount of 9.8% (previous ESOS was @9 Sen). So …
a. looks like shareholders who took up the earlier 9 Sen rights issue shall have a tough time recovering from their original 2015 investment as the enormous amount of 15% of total share capital ESOS options @2.2+ Sen ( (approx 765M?) as stated on page 7 Circular to shareholder) shall form a gigantic obstacle / trading barrier to the share price, along with another 745,374,758 new Bornoil Placement Shares @RM0.0221 that follow).
b. I am not sure what did the employees and/or eligible persons has done so far for the Company other than busy selling their 747,966,000 ESOS entitlements during last share run; neither financials of the company has conclusively shown any evidence to suggest they did a fantastic job - esp in handling fund raised during last share issue; so NOW I seriously DON’T see any justification by rewarding them with a second round of ESOS @ 78% discount from shareholders earlier subscription price of 9 Sen.
Note: proceeds raised from Right Issue = RM231.52 million (2015); cash & balances left with Group: (2018) RM16,041,656 from RM42,706,467 (2017) ; Company level: (2018) RM9,894,636 from RM31,199,437(2017) ; 2019: Group RM24,019,161 (improved); Company: RM2,325,844 (worsening). Source: Borneo Oil Berhad 2018 /2019 Annual Reports.
c. the newly proposed private placement in issuance of, in total, approx 745,374,758 + approx 765 million(?) new ESOS shares (approx 765M?). Looks like this is the ONLY GOOD news as there are enough CHEAP shares for a share run. BUT if SOLEY based on existing business of selling limestones, bread and buns and lacklustre performance of its much hyped gold mining business promoted during last rights issue, it can be real tough for existing investors to hope for real income to expect its business recovery.
Personally, I still like the gold mining B.Oil originally engaged back in 2015 but the Company lacked direct involvement in its earlier investment. Say, IF they have learnt from mistakes, begin owning a gold mining concession or has a mid-to long term mining leased / licencing, that may turn around investors’ perception for the stock based on prevailing precious metal price trend.
B.Oil share capital is SO HUGE (5.36B ?) and based on disappointing ways the Company was managed for last 5 years; so unless there is injection of really good existing business from HSCB or alternate good investment such as serious GOLD exploration (MUST come with MEANINGFUL SIZE of independent JORC certified minerals ore reserves) can only possibly see everyone has a chance to recover their investment. To me, limestone is also a kind of mining, only capital investment, knowhow, capability and a little luck separate between gold & the rock.
Well, there are many other precious rare earth minerals on earth, may be they can find other options, but IF the Company is solely based on selling Buns & limestones, you can literally announce THIS STOCK IS DEAD and remain its “PARIAH” status forever. However, as my entry cost is lower than both ESOS & Private Placement price, it’s still quite safe; so I shall still hold my faith for a year to access what can they do with things they didn’t do all these while.
Good luck & I go hibernating now Bye."

“on a positive note, the division’s exploration team had yielded encouraging results on the gold exploration conducted at Bukit Ibam, Pahang with inferred reserves of 1.8 metric tonnes of gold. Initial findings covering an area of about 1.98 hectares out of a total of 187 hectares in the tenement showed that the indicated gold grade is about 1.08 grams of gold per metric ton with a total probable gold reserves of about 550 kilograms. The Management is evaluating all options available for optimal production arrangements to extract the gold ores which will contribute positively to the Group in the foreseeable future.”

Based on Fundamental analysis our current PE guideline is approx 57.14 (Based on 1.75% of BNM base rate) thus the actual price for KPJ should be RM2.71.
Covid-19 only good for medical sector (more clearly is protective medical equipment “glove, mask, face shield and etc” and diagnosis instrument “thermo scanners, PCR tester and etc” For Malaysia top glove, harta, kossan and supermx all are the first round winners.
For the last stage of vaccination development, now is the time to look for the next gem but unfortunately our country is impossible to produce these vaccine. The only vaccine we can get is import and we hv 20+mil ppl need to be vaccinated. Early stage of vaccine must be very expensive and gov won’t sponsor. We only can get vaccinated through private hospital no matter for travel or job requirement or just stay safe. Based on 2019, KPJ recorded 2,629,878 outpatients @ net profit 226.7mil with 28 hospitals overall the state. If half of 20mil ppl go KPJ for vaccination so approx net profit can reach up to 1bil. And u need to know tat those vaccine isn’t 1 injection for lifetime (like seasonally flu vaccine) and must get it semi or annually. RM1k-2k per vaccine per yrs for everyone to stay safe is new normal of post covid-19. And it is long term investment value of KPJ.
There are 23 potential vaccines developed and 3 candidates already passed the clinical trial and go for final stage of testing.
1. Moderna vaccine enter the final stage of human trials for its COVID-19 vaccine on July 27.
2. Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine show good immune responses without side effect.
3. Chinese-made vaccine from Sinovac Biotech at final stage of testing in Brazil.
PATHOLOGY SERVICES - LABLINK (M) SDN BHD provide laboratory/pathology services to the KPJ Group. It manages the pathology laboratories in KPJ’s network of hospitals. Lablink also conducts clinical tests for more than 100 non-KPJ institutions (including hospitals under the Ministry of Health and University Hospitals) as wellas general practitioners’ clinics across Malaysia. Lablink is the first lab in Malaysia to be certified with Bio-Safety Level 3 (BSL3) facilities which allows testing of highly infectious diseases (according to World Health Organization (WHO) standards). In Mar 2020, Lablink was one of the private laboratories listed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to perform COVID-19 rRT-PCR (i.e. real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) by testing specimens received from hospitals: both from walk-in members of the public as well as hospital inpatients. Lablink recorded revenue of RM102.2 million in 2019.
The KPJ group of Hospitals classified Covid 19 rRT-PCR test according to urgent (result within 24 hours) and routine (beyond 24 hours). The COVID-19 testing capacity has been ramped up and Lablink has been able to test and report about 1,500-3,000 samples in a day in May 2020. The total number of samples, as at the end of May 2020 was in excess of 70,000; of which the KPJ-Group of Hospitals Nationwide contributed to almost 75% of the tests while the balance was from non-KPJ hospitals and the Ministry of Health.
PHARMASERV ALLIANCES SDN BHD (PASB) is KPJ’s centralized wholesaler and distributor of pharmaceutical, medical disposables and other hospital related products. Its clients are the KPJ network of hospitals and companies, as well as external clients within the government sector and other healthcare sector players. PASB is able to achieve profitable growth and retain a competitive edge by transferring cost savings to customers. In 2019, its revenue increased to RM451.1 million.
Regardless of Covid 19 outbreak, KPJ remain resilient of its business model. The group switches over to ramp up testing services and can generate augur profit to offset any downturn during outbreak."

Long-term low interest rates and a tight gold market are factors that could continue to drive the rally in the precious metal."

a. someone already has a hand on the private placement shares which could be amounting to 700+ million as well as ESOS (even at 15% for first year from 700+million is approx 110 million shares (-27m just exercised = approx 95 million ) If you are in the opinion, the Company is not serious to go for mining for good, even for a speculative share play, for the whoever to distribute 800 million shares you need to have a good story line plus a good, fierce run for its share price(s). Your advice is definitely good when it approaches upper price limit but not at this lower end of the price scale; in fact - you should even consider accumulate some mother shares to hit them at high so while you unleash your anger, you make sure they also pay you handsomely while you slap at their faces. hehe..
b. ASSUMING B.OIL uses the glittering previous metal as bridging (I have some basis for this guess, they recently announced acquisition of a newco (but ... seemingly like a waste H20 project management company?), but real run for gold shall begin end of this or most likely, NEXT YEAR. Source of the problems is heavily inflated USD issued during the pandemic, here are some other opinions:
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-25/the-message-behind-...
My personal estimation is between USD2800~3180-00; so it almost coincides with Bank of America earlier prediction of USD3000-00

encouraging results on the gold exploration conducted at Bukit
Ibam, Pahang with inferred reserves of 1.8 metric tonnes of gold.
Initial findings covering an area of about 1.98 hectares out of a
total of 187 hectares in the tenement showed that the indicated
gold grade is about 1.08 grams of gold per metric ton with a
total probable gold reserves of about 550 kilograms.

Subsequently in March 2015, BornOil, via an Exclusive Production Sharing Agreement with HDL, was granted sole and exclusive right to prospect, explore, mine, extract, process, sell and collect all revenue of sales with respect to all minerals and precious metals including gold over the said area.
Currently, an area measuring approximately 187 hectares/ 462 acres within the area has been issued with a mining lease on which the BornOil Group is currently carrying out mining works.
The mining area, in turn, is divided into 8 zones on which the BornOil group has been conducting detailed exploration works.
At the conclusion of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the preliminary exploration works on 7 of the 8 zones from A to G, an assessment of potential gold resources dated March 2019 was prepared by Dr. Yves showing potential gold resources of 60,032 oz or 1,866,943 gm (1.866 ton) of gold."

The guy is right. WC is cheap. WC/WD is almost identical except for a slightly longer expiry. Valuation is pegged to mother share, it does not really matter in the longer run whether WD has less issued shares or not. It is difficult to manipulate 1 over another when exercise cost is the same, you're talking about a buy/sell queue difference or a bid at best.
WC's show has not really started. Once Bornoil hits 10c+ WC's gains will be exponential"

chyle54 It will be a good bet. If it turns non-exciting then holding at 0.055 or 0.05 the downside is 0.03. The losses is manageable. Warrant D has only 370++ million issued, now @ 0.02 still manageable. Downside will be around 0.01...manageable risk (paper lost). In others words who knows what will happen tomorrow. If you afraid to be scamed by the news...buy small 100,000 units...either 5500 or 2000 for warrant. Limited issuance warrant allows this warrant to react faster compared to Warrant X which has larger issuance."

The findings was affirmed by Dr Yves Cheze, a member of the Australian Institute of Geoscientists as well as the Institute Geology Malaysia. - So finding is 100% confirmed.
Cheze also recommended BornOil to develop the exploration of not only the immediate extension of the first zone but also in several other zones in the mining area that have similar geology as they may hold significant potential for additional gold resources.
""Significant potential"" as quoted by them, so defintiely can be more than that."

Dr Yves has also recommended BornOil group to develop the exploration of not only the immediate extension of the first zone but also in several other zones in the mining area that have similar geology as they may hold significant potential for additional gold resources. BornOil is also continuing with exploration works on the other seven zones at an interval of three to six months for each zone.
Will start mining soon
Subsequent to the findings, it intends to proceed with mining works in the zone through an outsourcing business structure and the group is now in the process of selecting a suitable contractor for the task.
With current gold vibes in play and at its highest price, this is the potential stock you can hold."

The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is at risk of devaluation, and should the underlying assets fail, gold will respond by “rising to a price that balances the Fed’s balance sheet,” said Dan Oliver, founder of Myrmikan Capital.
“The Fed, as you know, has been on a massive purchasing spree because of the virus situation, and so therefore the equilibrium price of gold is going up commensurately, and so the numbers now to balance that balance sheet are enormously high,” he said. “My [forecast for gold prices] has changed. I’m at $10,000 now.”"

To elaborate how much Gold can be extracted from the total resources
of 22,200 oz. and the basis of estimation
4.1 Based on metallurgical tests conducted, up to 90% of the gold can
be extracted, 30% by gravity and 70% by Carbon In Leach (CIL).
simply count 90% out of 22200oz = 19980 oz. refer to average gold price per oz 2000usd.
means total collection 39,960,000 USD. to MYR becomes RM 159,840 ,000.

Based on Fundamental analysis our current PE guideline is approx 57.14 (Based on 1.75% of BNM base rate) thus the actual price for KPJ should be RM2.71.
Covid-19 only good for medical sector (more clearly is protective medical equipment “glove, mask, face shield and etc” and diagnosis instrument “thermo scanners, PCR tester and etc” For Malaysia top glove, harta, kossan and supermx all are the first round winners.
For the last stage of vaccination development, now is the time to look for the next gem but unfortunately our country is impossible to produce these vaccine. The only vaccine we can get is import and we hv 20+mil ppl need to be vaccinated. Early stage of vaccine must be very expensive and gov won’t sponsor. We only can get vaccinated through private hospital no matter for travel or job requirement or just stay safe. Based on 2019, KPJ recorded 2,629,878 outpatients @ net profit 226.7mil with 28 hospitals overall the state. If half of 20mil ppl go KPJ for vaccination so approx net profit can reach up to 1bil. And u need to know tat those vaccine isn’t 1 injection for lifetime (like seasonally flu vaccine) and must get it semi or annually. RM200-300 per vaccine per yrs for everyone to stay safe is new normal of post covid-19. And it is long term investment value of KPJ."

Personally, I always think open forum is the best place to identity stupidity among the crowd where it also help in verifying different grade of character . Secondly, Aaron Tan, think twice when you click in & leave any comment(s), as whatever you said shall leave a digital trace which would directly associate to your credibility in future post(s). I am quite sure you shall be vanishing from this forum for what you have commented when B.OIL was @ 3.5 sen and 1/2 sen, as I have told you “basis” of my guess was Gold related which proved I am right, as there were things you don’t know at all as B.Oil has recruited a top mining engineer from Canadian based Gold mining group, Monument Mining Limited, subsidiary Selinsing Gold Mine, Pahang 7 months ago to conduct gold exploration studies. If not I wouldn't have bought into it.
B.Oil is a share cap. dinosaur, w/share capital at 5.3 billions prior to issuance of another 760 million new placement shares + 745 million ESOS. In my opinion, none other than Gold shall be able to stir interest for public to look at B.Oil because:
ONE Metric Ton of Gold worths @ USD68 million while ONE Metric Ton of Limestone @ USD10~35
Ref: Alibaba on Malaysian limestone, min.5000 metric tons
To me, only idiots would choose to carry on mining limestone or rocky stuffs where B.Oil really did in spending RM37 Million to acquire a quarry @ Lahad Datu. The 37 Million decision reflects current mentality of the Company in relation to gold mining. So, here are some good/bad news to consider for your an investment or your holding decision:
Good news:
1. although the grammage is rather low @ current announced 0.43g/ton (comparing BAHVEST 0098’s 2.47g/ton *) which makes it not so viable for large scale commercial mining production, BUT - based on the report, it only represents 10% of total areas being explored. IF new update(s) suggest content increases on remaining 90% of the unexplored areas, it might affects this conclusion.
2.regardless, the mine can be a) for sale or b) pass the concession to more efficient Chinese miner or appoint them as contractor - either ways, it is income for the Company. 3. general belief the precious metal shall top USD3.000-00** an ounce in coming 15 months on possible devaluation of USD, it can be easy to find a partner or a gold mine purchaser internationally.
* assuming the production/processing capacity is 1000 tons/day or 2000 tons/day; meaning 2.47g shall deliver 2.47 KG / 4.94 KG of Gold a DAY ! ** Note: 1 ounce = 31.5g; yes, 0.43g also means 0.43/0.86 KG/day only.
Bad News:
1. NOT sure if B.Oil owns the concession and how long is permit-to-mine renewal. If it is short-term, no point dumping millions to set up factories and acquire other hardwares on uncertainty.
2. B.Oil currently “seemingly” has NO monies, unless those who has benefited from this round of placements / distribution can aid the mining operation or else, another rights issue or large scale share placements may be possible but this shall catapult share cap of the Company to .....…
3. Err … with previous 2015 shares distribution, I doubt B.Oil dare to test beyond 12~25 Sen territory UNLESS there are other significant hidden corporate weaponry announcement that we are not aware of.
Well, mineralisation requires time (& monies) to calculate probability. I am not greedy, so I opt for latter and has disposed all my 55 million shares/warrants on monday and become a “SowHai“ as aarontan1987 quoted me, haha. Well, the happy SOW-HAI has decided to reward himself tomorrow by driving to Kuchai Lama to order a plate of favourite RM6.50 MENG KEE's CHA SIU WONTON MEE and think of whereabouts is that scum and will he still dare to come back to this forum and read this post for him, hehe ..

Subject OTHERS
Description FURTHER ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON INDEPENDENT RESERVES ASSESSMENT JORC REPORT ON BUKIT IBAM GOLD PROSPECT AT MUKIM KERATONG
We refer to the earlier announcements dated 6 August 2020 and 10 August 2020 in relation to the above subject matter.
The Board of Directors of Borneo Oil Berhad wishes to provide further additional information and explanatory notes with regards to the following items as previously announced :
4. To elaborate how much Gold can be extracted from the total resources of 22,200 oz. and the basis of estimation.
4.1 Based on metallurgical tests conducted, up to 90% of the gold can be extracted and from this 30% by gravity and 70% by Carbon In Leach (CIL).
i.e out of 90% of 22,200 oz = 19,980 oz of gold extractable.
By gravity : 30% of 19,980 oz = 5,994 oz of gold extractable
By CIL : 70% of 19,980 oz = 13,986 oz of gold extractable
4.2 There are 2 methods to extract Gold, either :-
(a) Carbon In Leach (CIL) circuit (preferred method based on metallurgical test result) (please refer to chart as enclosed); or
(b) Heap Leaching process (not preferred). Based on test work conducted, only 30% gold can be extracted, due to high clay content and low permeability.
4.3 Metallurgical testing is an ongoing process tied to the exploration program.
8. Risk Factors for the Exploration and Mining Works
8.1 Weather
Malaysia has a tropical equatorial climate with seasonal bouts of heavy rainfall which may in some extreme situations cause floodings and landslides. Open pit mining and its infrastructures may face risks of pit floodings and landslips which will cause disruption/operational risks to the mining works.
8.2 Unforseen geological condition(s)
Sometimes it may be crucial to change the mine design and/or mine plan on a timely manner to address geotechnical risk. The value of open pit mining operation is primarily driven by ore vs. waste strip ratio. The less waste to move to extract ore, the higher the revenue that open pit mine generates. Open pit slope geometry (or slop angles) is at the core of mine design and is determined based on rock mechanics principles by geotechnical engineers. It is in their custody to design stable slopes to produce the most value for the excavation. In a large open pit, a change of a slope angle by one degree can result in either increase or decrease of waste volume, which has a notable impact on total costs.
8.3 Metallurgical challenges
Gold occur as deposits called lodes, or veins, in fractured rock.Chemical differences in the fluids and rocks, as well as physical differences in the rocks, create many different types of lode deposits.
8.4 Changes in Government policies
Changes in government policies over mining and the environment may cause mining permits to be suspended or mining leases to be subjected to new and stringent rules and regulations.
8.5 Standard industrial risks associated with gold mining
The nature of gold mining is a medium to high financial risk industrial activity. It will normally take a duration of many years from the start of exploration to full production.
8.6 Fluctuations in gold prices.
Gold prices is tied to the US Dollar and geopolitical events. Any strenghts or weaknesses in the US Dollar will affect the price of gold. The fluctuation in gold prices has a direct correlation on the profitability that is associated with the profitability and currency risks in the mining works.

JOHOR BAHRU (Aug 15): Global technology giants Microsoft, Amazon and Google have shown interest in together developing Malaysia into a regional hub for information technology (IT), says Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin.
The prime minister said representatives of the major tech firms expressed their interest at a meeting with him recently.
“I think many have shown their interest in helping Malaysia. Recently the leaders of Microsoft, Amazon and Google met with me expressing their readiness to be involved in the process of developing Malaysia in the IT and other fields to make Malaysia a regional centre.
“But first, to make sure, does our country have the best connectivity? The main issue usually raised is lack of access. Our Internet is not efficient,” he said at a town hall session with state and federal civil servants in Johor here today.
Muhyiddin, who is also Pagoh MP, also said Malaysia has not achieved a competitive level of Internet connectivity, citing the example of a schoolgirl in Sabah who had to climb a tree to get good Internet access.
He said while the government’s commitment to improving its Internet connectivity is already there, the time has come to step forward to expand access.
In June, Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) student Veveonah Mosibin, 18, of Kampung Sapatalang in Pitas, Sabah uploaded YouTube videos of her spending the night in a tree to get better Internet access for her online university examinations.
The videos have since been viewed over 150,000 times."

Gold Future price has successfully broke USD2,000 this morning, reaching USD 2,003/oz. International Analyst projected Gold Future price to reach USD2,500 in near term and potential to peak USD4,000 in longer term.
Gold counters are set to be bullish for the days to come. NICE (7139) taking the lead, surged to 0.345 (gained 21%) that still far away from it's all time high of 0.53 just 2 weeks ago.
If Gold Future continue to be bullish, NICE is set to break it's all time high and potentially to reach 0.845."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001255.jsp?ftp=449","Aug 18, 2020 3:54 PM","Stonecold","KUALA LUMPUR: Borneo Oil Bhd (BornOil) today inked a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Minetech Resources Bhd (MRB) to carry out mining works at Bukit Ibam, Pahang.
Both companies, via their respective wholly-owned subsidiaries, Borneo Oil & Gas Corporation Sdn Bhd (BOG) and Minetech Construction Sdn Bhd (MCSB), will work together towards the materialisation of a business contract which will involve BOG appointing MCSB as the contractor for mining works at Bukit Ibam.
MCSB, which specialises in rock blasting, civil engineering, construction and infrastructure development, is also involved in the business of mining and has the prerequisite equipment, expertise and personnel with experience in mining works.
MCSB is also currently undertaking mining excavation works at Selinsing Gold Mine at Sungai Koyan Kuala Lipis, Pahang, according to separate announcements to Bursa Malaysia today.
To note, MRB executive chairman Datuk Awang Daud Awang Putera also sits on the board of Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd as a non-independent and non-executive director.
BornOil's Bursa Malaysia announcement stated the collaboration with MCSB will reduce BOG's capital outlay required for the mining works and free up resources to continue with exploration works on other zones.
It will also provide the parties an opportunity to collaborate in the field of mining and to utilise each respective party's experience and strength, the filing added.
Under the MoU, MCSB will among others provide the plant and equipment for the purpose of excavation and qualified personnel to implement blasting activity.
To recap, BornOil had made an announcement to Bursa Malaysia on 6 August 2020 that it intends to proceed with excavation and mining on the first Zone of Bukit Ibam in Pahang, where it is believed to contain total resources of 22,200 ounce or 621,917 gm of gold in 1.66 million metric tons of ore with an average grade of 0.42 g/t.
The findings were made by Dr Yves Cheze, a member of the Australian Institute of Geoscientists as well as the Institute Geology Malaysia.
Dr Yves had also recommended for BornOil to develop the exploration of not only the immediate extension of the first zone but also in seven other zones within the mining area that have similar geology as they may hold significant potential for additional gold resources.
Back in May 2010, Perbadanan Kemajuan Negeri Pahang (PKNP)
signed an exclusive agreement with HDL Global Sdn Bhd (HDL) for the prospecting and mining rights to an area covering 1,200 hectares within Hutan Simpan Bukit Ibam in Pahang.
Subsequently in March 2015, BornOil, via an exclusive production sharing agreement with HDL, was granted sole and exclusive right to prospect, explore, mine, extract, process, sell and collect all revenue of sales with respect to all minerals and precious metals including gold over the said area.
Currently, an area measuring approximately 462 acres within the area has been issued with a mining lease on which BornOil is currently carrying out mining works.
At the conclusion of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the preliminary exploration works on seven of the eight zones, an assessment of potential gold resources dated March 2019 was prepared by Dr Yves showing potential gold resources of 60,032 ounce or 1,866,943 gm (1.866 ton) of gold.
Gold prices have been on the rise, and, for the first time, breached the US$2,000 an ounce mark last week."

bchew, there will always have this kind of loser around. We just have to entertain them a bit and laugh about it at the end of the day. Bornoil has very high prospect and this year will have big progress on its 3 maiden projects...
(1) The Biofraction Vetrolysis Plant in Lahad Datu is expected to be completed in December 2017 and will commence test runs in late January 2018.
(2) The Heap Leaching Pilot Project will have its first trial run soon, after a delay of almost nine months due to metallurgy testing.
(3) An estimated 2.0 million tons of non-marble limestone have been produced through the extraction of marble blocks and the same is an ideal feedstock for lime-based products. Once the various processing plans are finalized and if agreed to be implemented by the Division, relevant announcements will be made

Recent pp is highly possible to siphon fund for some pep for election purposes. Co needs them to help with licensing etc etc...
MSH themselves are pressing down the price so that they can buy back those pp shares cheaper rather than letting the share price fly thus more costly to buy back and maintain their controlling block.
Yet supporting the share price at current level will provide sufficient funding for those pep per their requests that's why price wont come down more.
Wait till after the election, you will see the share price go up in tandem with XAU, TP20c...

I believe it is not easy to start up the gold excavation. It needs in-depth study and survey on the land, technology use, funding and most importantly, land is the state matter, it has to deal with state government and the politicians.
I believe everything is in order now. Be patient and hold tight. Gold price is spiking high, at this very difficult time, the government will give full report to this as well.

Both companies, via their respective wholly-owned subsidiaries, Borneo Oil & Gas Corporation Sdn Bhd (BOG) and Minetech Construction Sdn Bhd (MCSB), will work together towards the materialisation of a business contract which will involve BOG appointing MCSB as the contractor for mining works at Bukit Ibam.
MCSB, which specialises in rock blasting, civil engineering, construction and infrastructure development, is also involved in the business of mining and has the prerequisite equipment, expertise and personnel with experience in mining works.
MCSB is also currently undertaking mining excavation works at Selinsing Gold Mine at Sungai Koyan Kuala Lipis, Pahang, according to separate announcements to Bursa Malaysia
To note, MRB executive chairman Datuk Awang Daud Awang Putera also sits on the board of Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd as a non-independent and non-executive director.
BornOil's Bursa Malaysia announcement stated the collaboration with MCSB will reduce BOG's capital outlay required for the mining works and free up resources to continue with exploration works on other zones.
It will also provide the parties an opportunity to collaborate in the field of mining and to utilise each respective party's experience and strength, the filing added.
Under the MoU, MCSB will among others provide the plant and equipment for the purpose of excavation and qualified personnel to implement blasting activity.
To recap, BornOil had made an announcement to Bursa Malaysia on 6 August 2020 that it intends to proceed with excavation and mining on the first Zone of Bukit Ibam in Pahang, where it is believed to contain total resources of 22,200 ounce or 621,917 gm of gold in 1.66 million metric tons of ore with an average grade of 0.42 g/t.
The findings were made by Dr Yves Cheze, a member of the Australian Institute of Geoscientists as well as the Institute Geology Malaysia.
Dr Yves had also recommended for BornOil to develop the exploration of not only the immediate extension of the first zone but also in seven other zones within the mining area that have similar geology as they may hold significant potential for additional gold resources.
Back in May 2010, Perbadanan Kemajuan Negeri Pahang (PKNP)
signed an exclusive agreement with HDL Global Sdn Bhd (HDL) for the prospecting and mining rights to an area covering 1,200 hectares within Hutan Simpan Bukit Ibam in Pahang.
Subsequently in March 2015, BornOil, via an exclusive production sharing agreement with HDL, was granted sole and exclusive right to prospect, explore, mine, extract, process, sell and collect all revenue of sales with respect to all minerals and precious metals including gold over the said area.
Currently, an area measuring approximately 462 acres within the area has been issued with a mining lease on which BornOil is currently carrying out mining works.
At the conclusion of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the preliminary exploration works on seven of the eight zones, an assessment of potential gold resources dated March 2019 was prepared by Dr Yves showing potential gold resources of 60,032 ounce or 1,866,943 gm (1.866 ton) of gold.
Gold prices have been on the rise, and, for the first time, breached the US$2,000 an ounce mark last week.

Jim Rogers gives the best investing advice you’ll hear, talks next big market crash
David Lin David Lin
Wednesday August 19, 2020 12:21
Kitco News
Jim Rogers, chairman of Rogers Holdings and co-founder of the legendary Quantum Fund, said that the next financial crash could be even worse than what we saw this year
On gold, prices still have a lot of room left to climb, Rogers said, adding that Warren Buffett did not enter the gold market too late with his recent purchase of Barrick Gold shares.
“If I’m right, gold is going to go much, much, much higher before this is over. Gold may well turn into a bubble. I hope it doesn’t, because if it turns into a bubble, I’ll have to sell it and I never want to sell it. I want my children to have my gold and silver someday,” he said.
Rogers draws on his decades-long investing experience, from his early days on Wall St. to his successes with the Quantum Fund, to give candid advice to any investor looking to win in the long haul."

While the full economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is still unfolding, the scale and duration of which remain uncertain, coupled with the volatile stocks markets have resulted in investors flocking to
gold as a safe haven asset and pushing gold prices to a record-breaking run reaching an all-time high of above USD2,000 per ounce.
Subsequent to our announcement on an Independent Reserves Assessment under the Australasian Code on Reporting of Exploration Results - Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (JORC Report) on the Bukit Ibam Gold Prospect at Mukim Keratong, a Memorandum of Understanding (""MOU"") was signed with Minetech Construction Sdn Bhd on 10 August 2020 and 13 August 2020 respectively. The proposed joint collaboration between the parties will reduce the Group’s capital outlay required for the gold mining works and free the Group’s resources to continue with the gold exploration works on other Zones. The Board will continue to exploit the Group’s assets to take advantage of the soaring gold prices.
Amidst these external headwinds, the Board will remain cautious and focus on drawing on our advantages through effective collaboration with external parties to enhance our ability to face the challenges ahead."

But should gold shoot up, Bornoil will run. $2300, $2500...we shall see

But still i can see thr prospect of this company, take it as example, 2016 they started mining gold which only cost 1600 per ounce. And still able cover the high expenses.
Compare to current is already worth more than 300 per ounce.
And the company revenue itself ar growing. And tried to invest on property. Which in my opinion are good strategy.
At this time gold help them earn profit in covid-19, and after the recovery of the economic , gold price will drop, and property and tourism will start to boom.
That's what i think.
But the only think i am concern is their management, they should be more active in the market to attract more investor, provide the prospect of the company and plan.
Keep the remain investor to be confident. So it have more money to generate more revenue and profit."

well, taking the gloves counter as an example - the price was moving sideways until someone realize the potential of it. Hence, it is the same here - once the actual gold being mined, sold and reflected in balance sheet - dont think you will even see anything below RM 0.10.
Global recession will happen as we can see that even vaccine development is there but the effectiveness will be a question and even if it is 100% effective, it will take time to reach to the whole world.
People already predicting the global recession to spill over to 2021 and looking at the company-it still made resonable profit without actually mining the new discovery hence, once they start (minetec -something to watch out for), there will be a sudden jump in profit.
a few things that i am still researching :-
1. What is the deal with Minetec (if it is profit sharing or fix cost payment) - in their QR report, it mentioned that with minetec, they are able to focus their resources in exploring other zones.
2. This company had mining right but we all know in malaysia without a proper cable connection, this is not possible - hence, who is behind this company?
My prospect target
1. Looking at Bahvest and other gold trading company, my TP would be in the range of RM0.50 (First resistance will be RM0.10 in which will go on once field gold mining starts and the QR indicates the revenue from this)
2. Support range is very clear at 0.05-0.055 with limited downside (unless the whole world magically recovered and global economy goes back to pre-covid- which even then gold was around USD1600/oz) - good thing is that gold price is not affected by the vaccines news but the weakness of US Dollar - we know that this country not going to recover that easily with death and infection rates climbing. If these people can think Covid19 is a hoax, imagine the vaccine?
hence, this is not a counter for contra traders but more of an investment for your spare cash.

Borneo Oil executive director Raymond Teo Kiew Leong said the newly opened BAF outlet covers a 3,000 sq ft floor area and provides about 120 seats in a two-level shop. The popular Sarawak Laksa and Garoupa fish noodles from Sabah are the signature dishes. Other items on the menu include fish burger and SugarBun’s roasted chicken. (File pic shows Raymond Teo checking on sales with waitresses of a restaurant in Kuching)
KUCHING: Borneo Oil Bhd’s drive to promote some of the most sought after dishes from Sarawak and Sabah to food lovers in Peninsula Malaysia has reached another level with the opening of the second franchise Borneo Asian Food (BAF) outlet along Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman near Chow Kit in Kuala Lumpur.
And more franchise BAF outlets are in the pipeline in the federal capital.
Borneo Oil also operates the homegrown SugarBun fast food restaurant chain and Singapore-based Pezzo pizza outlets in Sarawak and Sabah.
Borneo Oil executive director Raymond Teo Kiew Leong said the newly opened BAF outlet covers a 3,000 sq ft floor area and provides about 120 seats in a two-level shop.
The popular Sarawak Laksa and Garoupa fish noodles from Sabah are the signature dishes. Other items on the menu include fish burger and SugarBun’s roasted chicken.
“We are targeting high traffic working class consumers for the BAF restaurants, ” he told StarBiz. According to Teo, the Borneo Oil-owned BAF outlet in Menara Hap Seng, Kuala Lumpur has been doing brisk business since it commenced operation four years ago.
The first BAF outlet is located at Pacific Place, Ara Damansara in Petaling Jaya.
He said the plan to set up two more franchise BAF outlets this year in Hap Seng-owned properties in the peninsula has been put off to 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic which has affected the food and beverage business.
“We have one BAF outlet in Johore Bahru.In Sarawak, there are one outlet each in Kuching and Miri and the proposed third outlet at Boulevard Mall, BIntulu has delayed its opening to end-2020 due to the pandemic, ” said Teo.
On overseas expansion of SugarBun restaurant, he said the opening of the first franchised restaurant in Jarkata, Indonesia has also been delayed because of the pandemic.
“We plan to next expand to New Zealand
“The plan to establish the first franchise SugarBun outlet in Auckland is being finalised, ” added Teo.
Currently, there are franchise SugarBun restaurants in oil-rich Brunei, Australia and China.
There are some 80 Sugarbun restaurant, mostly in key and secondary towns in Sarawak and Sabah.
Teo said Borneo Oil is expected to launch its own food delivery services system soon as about 60% of SugarBun sales are now from delivery service as the number of consumers dining in has sharply dropped due to the restrictions related to Covid-19 lockdown measures.
Last year, SugarBun entered into collaboration with Food Panda (a German mobile food delivery marketplace), which is an online food ordering website that connects users with selected local restaurants.
The collaboration has boosted SugarBun sales.
Once launched, Teo said SugarBun will have its own delivery services in all towns where its franchise outlets operate.
“We are going to have a tie-up with Sarawak Pay, ” he said. (Sarawak Pay is an initiative of the Sarawak government to provide a one-stop mobile app payment channel for the public to make payments for bills or purchases through their mobile phones.)
In financial year ended June 30(FY2020), Borneo Oil’s food and franchise operations recorded lower revenue of RM41mil from RM48.4mil in FY2019, dragged down by the sharp decrease in sales in 4Q2020 at RM7.37mil against RM12.5mil in 4Q2019, or down by RM5.14mil due to the movement control order (MCO) imposed by the government on March 18 to contain the spread of the pandemic."

Executive Director
Datuk Joseph Lee Yok Min @ Ambrose was appointed as an Executive Director of Borneo Oil Berhad on 27th March 2019. Prior to his appointment as an Executive Director, he acted as a consultant on legal and financial matters. He graduated with a Bachelor of Law (Honours) Degree from Central Lancashire University, United Kingdom (1980) and qualified as a Barrister At Law (Lincoln’s Inn) London in 1981. He was called to the Sabah Bar in 1982 and is an Advocate and Solicitor of the High Court of Sabah and Sarawak.
He is a Practicing Legal Consultant and an established businessman with more than 30 years of experience in various industries. He currently spearheads the strategic and sustainable growth of Borneo Oil Berhad.
Go Figure - Spearhead the strategic and sustainable growth......
now why would legal consultant topping up shares? i did some digging on the announcement on minetec MOU
Financial Effects and Percentage Ratio
The effects on the total issued shares, substantial shareholders’ shareholdings, financial position in respect of the netassets and gearing ratio of BOB as well as earnings level of BOB cannot be determined at this juncture as formal agreements in relation to the Joint Collaboration are yet to be identified. Similarly, the highest percentage ratio applicable for the Joint Collaboration is not available at this juncture. The above information will be announced immediately upon the signing of the formal agreements in relation to the Joint Collaboration.However, upon the successful implementation of the terms and the intention as set out in the MOU, the Group may see a potential benefit in terms of its financial performance.
thus, i am guessing some form of agreement would be on the way
#not a buy or sell call#
but if you are selling, then i am waiting (one of the few hundreds queueing to buy)"

Typically share buy back because
1. Company wants to retain its price to attract investor
2. Company buy at low and later sell at high (in anticipation that it will be higher)
3. Reduce the volatility in the market so that it is able to move up faster (less heavy weight)
I think most likely no 1 as they had issued PP and market value is lower than PP. Those private investor will be up their asses coz had to buy premium. So, they will push it to 0.06 or 0.065 so that PP is attractive."

It is about 3% of the total shares issued and the company spent about RM8.6m for the share buy back. This is something like what Top Glove and Supermax did a few days ago. If Bornoil continue to do more share buy back, I trust the share price will surely go up as they will eat up all the sellers and the buy back actually reduces the number of shares in circulation."

But wisely, look at Bornoil's balance sheet, their financial condition looks good. Their cash to debt ratio is healthy. No big loan. Without loan which cannot cover by the company, there should be no bankruptcy. Bankruptcy only normally initiated by the creditors because of the company's inability to serve the loan.
I got cheated by one of counter before , with a good balance sheet, but its declared bankrupt and its director got fined in court.
Conclusion: If there is no makeup done to their balance sheet and with records of profits earned every quarter and reasonable NTA, we should not worry about its bankruptcy's probability."

I agree with you Mr MZM2511, In fact what you said is the same as what I said.
(Net tangible assets are calculated as the total assets of a company, minus any intangible assets such as goodwill, patents, and trademarks, less all liabilities and the par value of preferred stock.)
In short: NTA is (value of the total portfolio of the compony less all liabilities divided by the number of shares issue by the company).

I think you should be realistic. before you invest you should look into the fundamentals of the stock, which NTA and PE ratio are part of it. In addition, you also should have exit strategy in place.

Instead, in the worst scenario if there will be a consolidation of the shares, it's should
be okay because probably it wont be involved ""a capital reduction"". The financial condition of the company is sound and its has a retained earnings of RM58,337,000 therefore no need for the company to exercise a capital reduction.
A share consolidation without a capital reduction exercises shouldn't gives negative impact to minority shareholders.

1. Bornoil completes their limstone plant and start making money out of it.
2. The last gold findings only on one of the zone - if other zones indicates reserve and the total gold reserved is more than 22,000 oz, then the valuation jump
3. They actually start the digging process - Counter becomes gold miner
on the gold price - if you had done research, you would know that it will sky rocket once US announce the second stimulus package where trillion of US dollar will be printed by Fed. Once value of USD drop, most of bond market will source for gold as their safe haven - so there is a potential of a new high.
for people like me...just need to hold until the above happens and if all 3 happens - people will hold like they are hold their mistresses coz it can easily reach 0.5 - only a matter of when

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on assumptions:
1. That the last PP will be ended fully before at the end of 2020.
Note 1:
The Proposed Private Placement, which is expected to be completed before the end of the fourth quarter of 2020.
Please refer:
https://www.bursamalaysia.com/market_information/announcements/company...
2. The third tranche of ESOS allotted on 16 Oct @3.68 sen amounted 400 mil should be the last tranche of ESOS under the new ESOS exercises. As today the balance of the last ESOS that not listed yet is 140 mil shares. After the last 140 shares listed, therefore this ESOS exercise will be completed. I think it will be sooner.
Note 2:
The maximum scenario of new ESOS can be allotted based on an announcement on 22 May 2020 is 1,118,062,38 units of shares.
Please refer: https://www.bursamalaysia.com/market_information/announcements/company...
Total ESOS granted is 1,200,000,000 units of shares (Tranche # 1 on 2 July 2020: 400 mil @3.5 + Tranche # 2 on 7 August 2020: 400 mil @4.34 sen + Tranche # 3 on 16 Oct 2020: 400 mil @3.68 sen)
Based on assumption 1 and 2, the PP and ESOS exercises will be completed before the end of December 2020. After that, no more ESOS and PP if there is no more new ESOS or PP proposed and approved. No more nightmares from these ESOS or PP.
4. In the conditions that the company's performance in terms of profitabilty is improved and have good development whether concerning having good projects or good development (for example gold minimg activities) the company share price can be more easily to be push upwards.

In my opinion, In this situation where so many (almost hundred or hundreds millions) PP or ESOS shares was listed and to be listed, it's hard for the operator to push the share price higher because the price/cost of PP or ESOS share holders are cheaper.
The NOSH of the company is 6 bil + and share spread in Bornoil is big. What can be done by operators/sharks (if there is any) is only to influence the market so that they can accumulate more shares at cheaper price for the next push up when the situation is more conducive for them to GORENG.
As for the company, to make sure the share price not down as per their target, the company will execute share buy back.

A share consolidation is where a set number of existing shares in a share class are consolidated into one share.

It merely alters the number of shares and the nominal value of each share."

As set out in note 1, Section 3 of this announcement, the Group has initiated several new business strategies and plans to enhance its FFO business segment's performance. These include, amongst others, launching of SugarBun e-wallet platform, inventing and producing its new in-house chili sauce namely, Sabasco Premium Sabah Borneo, and the development of a stand-alone outlet for all the Group's brands housed under its existing FFO business segment. In view of the foregoing, the Board and management of Bornoil are optimistic about the financial contribution that may be accrued from the new business strategies and plans to the Group moving forward. In respect of the PIM business segment, the expected date for commissioning of the ILPP has been delayed to third quarter of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted entry restriction of foreign nationals, who possess the prerequisite expertise to install the prefabricated plant equipment at the ILPP to Malaysia. Notwithstanding the above, the Group will keep abreast of the latest development and the regulation in respect of the travel requirements to and from Malaysia and will take necessary procedures or measures available should the restrictions be uplifted. In respect of RSE business segment, the Group, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, namely Borneo Oil & Gas Corporation Sdn Bhd, had on 13 August 2020, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (""MOU"") with Minetech Construction Sdn Bhd for a proposed joint collaboration on the gold mining works at Mukim Keratong, Pahang, to explore higher grade of mining ore. This joint collaboration will enable the parties to the MOU to leverage on each other's experience and resources in this project. Notwithstanding the current economic condition, the Board and the management are of the view that barring any unforeseen circumstances, the new business strategies in place will improve the financial performance of the Group in the long run."

To me, Australia Macquire Bank 20% if approved, then this will attract more ppl to ride on bornoil.
The 1.7 billion share (20%) is too large. U think esos at 3.6sen n sell at 4sen make money?
How to dispose such a large quantity if the price is not 10 times of now or even greater.
When ppl want buy, sure buy low. Especially insider. When they want to dispose. Many news out n price up high. Then they can sell."

KUALA LUMPUR, 27 March 2021 – In an announcement that had flown under the radar of the investment community, the Borneo Oil Berhad (BornOil) group announced last Thursday, 25 March 2021 that it had entered into an agreement to acquire an entity with a mining lease in Pahang.
The entity is Syarikat Ratna Pura Sdn Bhd (SRP) which BornOil would be acquiring a 90% stake for RM1.8 million.
SRP has a mining lease issued by the Pahang State Government for an area in Keratong, Pahang. It also has an approved operational mining scheme for mining operations from the Department of Mineral and Geoscience Malaysia, Pahang.
SRP group is principally engaged in mining operations. Its associate company, Syarikat Ratna Pura (Pahang) Sdn Bhd, is principally involved in gold mining operations.
BornOil executive director Datuk Joseph Ambrose Lee explained that this is the first time the group would be owning a mining lease: “Hence, this development marks BornOil’s first foray to seriously venture into gold mining, by owning a mining lease, instead of just being an operator as per our previous arrangements.”
As a result, BornOil would also be eliminating the tribute payable to the concession owner for every ounce of gold recovered. SRP is the concession owner for the mining area and is only subject to payment of royalty to the state government.
Datuk Joseph also explained that the acquisition would result in the group acquiring the mining area adjacent to its current mining area at Keratong, Rompin, Pahang.
“Consequently, BornOil will be expanding our acreage for mining operations within the central gold belt and eastern tin belt of Peninsular Malaysia,” Datuk Joseph further said.
“We would also be able to leverage on our expertise and deep knowledge of the Keratong area, thereby saving on the deployment of equipment and machinery to the adjacent mining area for operations,” he added.
“The other plus point is that the mining area is also located in close proximity to major infrastructural utilities,” said Datuk Joseph (second from left in pic).
BornOil’s other Pahang mining venture is at Bukit Ibam.
Dr. Yves Cheze, a member of the Australian Institute of Geoscientists and also the Institute Geology Malaysia, had reported that the first zone of Bukit Ibam is believed to contain total resources of 22,200 ounces or 621,917 gm of gold in 1.66 million metric tons of ore with an average grade of 0.42 g/t.
BornOil is also exploring several other zones in Bukit Ibam that have similar geology as they may hold significant potential for additional gold resources.
BornOil has sole and exclusive rights to prospect, explore, mine, extract, process, sell and collect all revenue of sales with respect to all minerals and precious metals including gold over the said area.
Due to the Movement Control Order (MCO), the second JORC report has been delayed. However, now that MCO has been lifted, BornOil is moving into full swing of the second stage of the JORC report.
On the corporate front, Macquarie Bank Limited has been subscribing for BornOil shares, in line with an agreement that the Australian bank is able to subscribe for up to 1.2 billion placement shares or 19 per cent of the company’s total number of issued shares.
Based on the illustrative issue price of RM0.036 per placement share and assuming full subscription by Macquarie Bank, Bornoil may raise gross proceeds of up to approximately RM43.41 million.

Same stories, Right issues, private placements, Esos, share get diluted, then next share coonsolidation, newbies forget about consolidations and think share price shoot up, and then again share price dip more and more to new low with more right issues, and private placement, esos etc... and consolidation.
We are seeing these for so many penny stocks.
Where these monies gone??
Bursa not checking all these moves??
The flexibilities bursa given to help the listed company become deployable...
So sad we have these type of things...

It is all about gold this time...hovering above USD1,800 an oz. What if it goes up to USD2,000 ?
The latest announcement is extremely positive especially the disposal of the Group's Technology Assets and Intellectual Property Rights which were totally impaired or written off in 2019. Now by selling off at USD5 million the Group will generate a gain on disposal of RM20,527,500 in 2021 which is about additional earnings of 43 sen per share arising from this gain.
Instead of cash, Bornoil will be getting 166,666,667 shares in Verde Resources Incorporated of which current market value (listed in USA) is USD0.06 per share. Hence, you will notice Bornoil is receiving Verde shares as consideration at a substantial discount (166,666,667 shares x 0.06 = USD10 million). There is excess profit over USD5 million.
Looks like with the recent continuous positive announcements following the 10 % share subscription by MacQuarie Bank, we can almost conclude that there will be better news ahead.
We must be aware that Macquarie Bank is a renowned bank in Australia with a share price quoted at AUD156 per share. So if Macquarie Bank is willing to be a shareholder in Bornoil,,there must surely be positive business plans to convince Macquarie Bank to invest 10 % capital.
All the best and good luck. I am picking up more shares.

Now it is more than 7.245 billions.
The other point I wish to raise is the volume of ESOS issued and exercised. Judging from the capital which the employees are willing to spend on exercising the options, I believe most of them will be keeping, perhaps knowing a little about the potential developments in the near future.
It will also be a good move if the Group decides to consolidate its capital by reducing the number of shares."

The Acquisition presents an opportunity for BOB, through its subsidiary BOG to acquire the
Mining Area adjacent to BOG’s current mining area at Mukim Keratong, Daerah Rompin,
Negeri Pahang.
BOG is able to leverage its expertise on the Mining Area with its present domain knowledge
of Mukim Keratong and will also save on the deployment of equipment and machineries to
the adjacent Mining Area for mining operations.
Through the acquisition of equity in SRP, BOG can eliminate the tribute payable to the
concession owner for every ounce of gold recovered as SRP is the concession owner for the
Mining Area and is only subject to payment of royalty to the State Government. The Mining Area is also located in close proximity to major infrastructural utilities.
The results from the Acquisition may be expected to contribute positively to its future earnings."

At this point no further share issuance approved as ESOS is now complete. IF MQ DO NOT SELL, they'll hold 14.7% of the new share base, which is pretty good...for the confidence of everyone it is important that MQ remains a shareholder and not coming in just to make half a cent.
One thing different from other large share base penny stocks is the curious act of Bornoil buying back shares. It's certainly foolish from shareholders pov - literally sell low buy high. Still, SBB is actually very substantial. Out of the 8.2B total shares, at least (up till now), 539M shares have been bought back. It's still worth $21.5M at 0.040.
At 8.2B shares x $0.04, Bornoil's market cap is $327M. Of which $98.8M consist of cash raised from ESOS, placements and MQ. Bornoil also has new loans of $50M available. At least we know it will not have cashflow problems in the near term...
So while it may seem like it can never go up, it's also not easy for it to go any lower. I had some luck getting mother share at 0.010 (only happened 1 day and I was in queue) then 0.020 and 0.025. I remain a shareholder after selling some in the last run. The quick crash is disappointing. Now that we are back at 3.5-4.0 cents, it does look pretty safe. Well if something can't go down, it can't be that bad an investment...ask yourself this, whenever market shakes and we look at our portfolio, we could be pretty sure this one counter is not the one to be worried about lol"

18/05/2021 11:38 PM
Agreed...there is progress however slow. Terminate minetech and do it themselves, acquire neighbouring mining lease and more. All these are positive. When gold spikes we really don't need them to show physical gold yet...so long as they can give the market confidence there is indeed gold 6 feet under and they own it it will be something. At least something better than the die die 3.5-4.0 cent everyday"

UK reported higher inflation rate again, and likely will spread to all parts of the world. If inflation would drive gold price up, then we should keep faith in gold. But if inflation unable to drive up the gold, there would a sign of a correction ahead. Next 2 weeks would be crucial for gold. Either it breaks the 1850 support to go towards usd1810 support, or it bounce back to usd 1900. FOMC unlikely to raise rate today.. their comment would important in the case they hint of raising rate in near future.

So question would be, are we really in recovery? Is this the same financial crisis that hit in 2008? Inflation is high. But with commodities price dropping, would that help? Chip shortage, probably takes another half a year to back to normal. Sea freight, with more countries reopening, more shipment needed, creating larger bottle neck.

For bornoil, 1.2B subscription by Macquire would raised about rm36m if averaging 3 Sen per share. Minus off share buy back at higher price, minus off operating losses, how much left? Starting a mining would required massive start up cost. Machinery would cost a few million atleast. And machinery value depreciate fast. Share buy back is a good sign.

Distribute 1-for-10 is equivalent to 10% dividend. Cancellation is good for book value and what a blue chip will do, quite unlike Bornoil lol
MQ's 1.2B subscription allows an additional 120M SBB
This counter is quite exciting la...do we have any reference anywhere else? A foreign IB taking up 20%, treasury shares 10%, net cash, fresh loans own gold mines...trading at 3 cents. how not exciting
justin1njp Sbb already reached 9.244%.

For a very brief moment we were able to buy at 1c 2c last crash. That was the only time. Now even MQ's cost is 3.2c. No matter how they churn it's not much lower than 3c.
The support at 2.5c and below is enormous. And to break below that someone ought to have the shares to dump.
Who has shares to dump at 2.5c and below, and why would they do that. Even if they dump at 2.5c we can hold and some may even buy - will they dump at 2.0c? No one really had an opportunity to have that low a cost
For other companies which have risen over a long time, maybe there were shareholders who had much lower cost. But this counter...the renewed Bornoil started when Hap Seng entered in a hugely dilutive rights issue and basically wiped out everyone else and took control of Bornoil. Their cost was at least 7.0c.
Many years later now there was never an escape wave...there is no way anyone can have a meaningful stake below 2.5c. Not even ESOS. ESOS records 400M at 2.7c, 400M at 3.684c, 216.5M at 3.28c. Placement 329M at 3.16c, 10.3M at 3.73c, 242M at 4.35c, 45M at 5.36c, 7.1M at 3.6c. MQ 887M at 3.194c.
so i say if it comes below 2.5c let it come and we can buy....

45.62M is Cash + FD
Inventories is 35M (mainly limestones and raw materials) excluding trade receivables of 12.35M and other receivables 27.7M. If u look at past records they have a good record of recovery. Hardly any bad debt - and if there were, subseuqent quarters showed recovery of such bad debts
Above is based on cut off date 31/3. Since then PP and ESOS raised 25M, SBB used 10.5M, so net cash + 14.5M
Investment properties are real and carried at book value. Look through the reports. Theres 612M here.
Company yet to have meaningful loans.
Last year after MCO secured a 50M loan. As I said before banks granting loan is a show of strength. Banks vet thru showing us another layer of scrutiny
Bornoil's book value is real. These are not goodwill etc. They are tangible assets.

Banyak syarikat yang mempunyai masalah kerugian terkumpul yang besar akan buat capital reduction bersama-sama dengan proses consolidation.
Dan biasanya, syarikat yang mempunyai BOD yang hanya memiliki peratus saham yang sedikit biasanya suka buat consolidation. Ini kerana kesan negatif consolidation banyak ditanggung oleh pelabur runcit berbanding pemegang saham insider.
NOSH yang besar bukan jadi sebab mewajibkan sesebuah syarikat membuat consolidation. Kecualilah:
1. Keadaan kewangan syarikat amat memerlukan consolidation dibuat, contohnya dalam keadaan kerugian terkumpul yang banyak dalam kunci kira-kira.
2. Atau ada UDANG DISEBALIK BATU dalam kalangan pengurusan sesebuah syarikat tertentu.
JIKA NOSH besar, keadaan kewangan okay, harga saham pun OKAY, syarikat tersebut rasanya tak perlu buat consolidation. LIHAT SAJA CONTOH MY E.G. Bukannya nak buat consolidation tetapi menambahkan lagi jumlah NOSH syarikat sampai 8 bilion unit melalui Bonus Issue."

1. Please don't give any conclusion about a company without knowing any basic knowledge of accounting or finance.
2. Some of the information or assumptions given was not true or misleading. Please do research for the true information.
2. Do you think that a company without any plans to do businesses is better than a

MY ACCUSATION ON YOU:
1. Infact, I suspect you have an ulterior motive.
2. Your analysis on certain companies looked bias, untrue and misleading. It's not fair to the company and its current share holders.

Inventories is 35M (mainly limestones and raw materials) excluding trade receivables of 12.35M and other receivables 27.7M. If u look at past records they have a good record of recovery. Hardly any bad debt - and if there were, subseuqent quarters showed recovery of such bad debts
Above is based on cut off date 31/3. Since then PP and ESOS raised 25M, SBB used 10.5M, so net cash + 14.5M
So total cash including receivables is 45.6M + 12.3M + 27.7M + 14.5M

When the Borneo Oil Berhad (BornOil)-Sugarbun Borneo Asian Food group launched the Sabasco ‘secret sauce’ in late July 2021, the intent was to bring a unique taste of Sabah for the whole of Malaysia – and the world eventually – to enjoy.
YB Datuk Seri Panglima Dr. Jeffrey Gapari Kitingan, the Deputy Chief Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries of Sabah, had launched Sabasco at the virtual event. He had also expressed his hope that the product would eventually become a ‘worldwide sensation’ as it is in line with the Sabah Maju Jaya Development plan to expand local agriculture globally.
Now more than two months later, Sabasco has certainly made its impact throughout Malaysia. The ‘secret ingredient’ of Sabasco is the ‘Momporok’ chilli unique to Sabah.
Late last week, Former Deputy Minister of Women, Family and Community Development and Member of Parliament for Segambut YB Hannah Yeoh posted about Sabasco on Facebook, describing the taste as ‘sedap but pedas’.
YB Hannah Yeoh added that she was adding Sabasco to fish nuggets and that she preferred the sweet and spicy version better. (Note that there’s no arrangement between the Sabasco team and YB Hannah Yeoh. The above Facebook post reproduced in good faith.)
From the Facebook post, it seems that Sabasco – and certainly YB Hannah Yeoh – certainly have their loyal followings. (extract of comments below.)
A few weeks back, Malaysian professional golfer Kelly Tan, who competes on the LPGA Tour, was also pictured happily with the two versions (original and sweet and spicy) of Sabasco sauce bottles in hand.
Kelly’s first professional win came at the 2019 Florida's Natural Charity Classic on the Symetra Tour.
So what is it about Sabasco that makes the sauce so special?
For one, the Momporok chilli is so-called because, in the Dusun language, it means the ‘bulbul’ bird’s chilli.
According to the Dusun tribe, the spread of these chillies was assisted by bulbul birds, which are attracted to the chillies when they’re ripe-red. They eat them and disperse the seeds all over their region of residence, and over time, the chillies in the area develop a singular set of characteristics, aroma and taste.
BornOil Executive Director Joseph Ambrose Lee said that, in Sabah, the Momporok chilli sauce is always placed at the centre of the table in every coffee shop.
“What’s special about the Sabasco version of Sabah’s beloved Momporok chilli sauce, however, is its origins,” he said.
A town on the East Coast of Sabah, Kunak, has a geographical makeup of volcanic soils rich in nutrients and the resident ‘bulbul’ birds.
The chilli thrives in Kunak, and its aroma and spice are intensely concentrated and distinctive. Over the decades, this breed of Momporok chilli in Kunak has been cultivated by local micro-farmers who stick to growing only this breed.
“In Kunak, the (chilli) fruits are allowed more time to mature with minimal intervention to spread their growth. Due to this, the result is a much more concentrated fruit. Tiny, red and upright; it is powerful in its spice and fragrance. Its uniqueness surpasses mass-planted chillies in adjacent regions. Each chilli fruit is hand-selected to ensure freshness and quality,” Datuk Ambrose explained.
He added that, through the production of Sabasco, SugarBun hopes to share the Momporok chilli’s story, support the Kunak farming industry, create local jobs, and bring ‘growing’ back closer to nature.
“Sabasco is grown, nurtured, harvested, prepared, and bottled locally,” said Datuk Ambrose.
“This is a chilli sauce close to our hearts. This is the chilli we grew up eating. This is the chilli for our homes, our friends, and family. And now, we’re bringing it to the rest of Malaysia – and the world.”
East Malaysians will find Sugarbun a familiar name. The chain established itself in Kuching, Sarawak back in the early 80s as a bakery and ice creamery. It had also branched out to selling burgers, broasted chicken and popcorn, establishing itself as a cinema concessionaire.
Today, other than its signature broasted chicken and fish burgers, Sugarbun’s outlets also offer Sarawak laksa, Sabah giant garoupa fish meehoon soup, various other claypot dishes, pizza, and of course, to top them all off, Sabasco chilli sauce.
Sabasco Chilli Sauce comes in both ‘original’ and ‘sweet and spicy’ flavours, and can be bought online from www.sabasco.com or from Shopee, and is available at all Sugarbun, Borneo Asian Food, and Broasted outlets nationwide, as well as Pezzo outlets in East Malaysia.

Lets try to understand the actual financial position of the company and the future prospects that are expected to drive the share price up. We all wish the price to rebound strongly and goes up after so many years of patience. In layman terms, I think the company is now much more stronger financially - having turned around and achieved good profit, having a number of established businesses, net cash position (i.e. total cash - borrowings = positive cash or no net borrowings or zero geared). The other positive factors are the willingness of a bank to granted them RM50m credit facilities recently and the involvement of Macquarie in the PP exercise."

On 25 January 2021, the ordinary resolution on the Proposed Subscription as prescribed in
the Notice of the Extraordinary General Meeting (""EGM"") of the Company dated 08 January
2021 was duly passed and approved by the shareholders of the Company by way of poll via
remote participation and voting at the EGM of the Company held on 25 January 2021.
As at the date of this report, a total of 915,000,000 Bornoil Shares had been issued pursuant

Proposed Subscription is still ongoing.
Hi guys, I just like to share my observation on the PP subscription by Macquarie. Of the 1.205bil or 20% of Bornoil capital, Macquarie has already subscribed 915mil or about 75% of the total amount and this roughly represents about 15 % of Bornoil capital. The fact that there has been no announcement of major shareholder acquisition of 5 % or more may indicate that Macquarie had probably sold most of the PP they subscribed. Not sure whether this is a good sign or bad sign. However in the event of share price uptrend in the coming future (potentially arising from the good latest QR), there may not be substantial selling pressure from Macquarie if they are holding only small amount of shares. Just my 2 sen view."

This quarter is about 2 things other than the ""one-off""
Firstly we should have expected more losses. MCO F&B and mining etc all severely affected. So no loss is already good
Secondly the reversal of mining (limestone/ marble) segment impairment losses lend credibility to their business

BornOil posts solid Q4 earnings, contribution from quoted securities
NST Business2-3 minutes 9/1/2021
KUALA LUMPUR: Borneo Oil Bhd (BornOil) reported a net profit and revenue of RM35.51 million and RM15.82 million for the fourth quarter (Q4) ended 30 June 2021 (FY21), an increase of 2,736 per cent and decrease of two per cent respectively.
The sharp increase in net earnings was due to fair value gain on an investment in quoted securities of RM26.46 million, reversal of impairment loss of RM18.63 million and disposal of business assets of RM1.91 million.
For the full year, BornOil's net profit jumped 1,784 per cent to RM28.51 million from RM1.59 million, while revenue decreased 42 per cent to RM51.40 million from RM88.28 million last year.
Its resources and sustainable energy division, in particular, reported profit before tax of RM16.98 million for the quarter due to a gain of RM20.54 million on reversal of impairment loss and disposal of business assets.
The New Straits Times previously reported that BornOil collaborates with Nevada-based Verde Resources of the United States on catalytic biofraction green technology initiatives.
This collaboration has enabled BornOil to penetrate the US market, where global investors have been demanding socially and environmentally conscious initiatives related to green sustainable products.
BornOil executive director Datuk Joseph Ambrose Lee said that the company has aspirations to be a global renewable energy player in converting palm oil waste products to biomass, biochar, biogas, biofuel and wood vinegar.
Under the Biden administration, the proposal of a US$2.25 trillion infrastructure plan will focus on green energy and decarbonisation.
BornOil's other core business is limestone, the main and monopolistic limestone supplier to the cement industries in Sabah and the BIMP-EAGA (Brunei Darussalam–Indonesia–Malaysia–Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area).
The company is also sitting on some strategic properties in Sabah.

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001255.jsp?ftp=554","Sep 4, 2021 12:51 PM","MZM2511","SEKADAR PANDANGAN SAYA SENDIRI. PARA PEMBACA YANG SUDI MEMBACA BOLEH KOMEN, TAK KIRA POSITIF ATAU NEGATIF
-----------------
Kita mungkin boleh perhatikan kebanyakan syarikat yang buat consolidation ialah apabila syarikat mengalami kerugian terkumpul yang banyak selain daripada NOSH yang besar. Pada kebiasaannya, banyak syarikat yang mempunyai masalah kerugian terkumpul yang besar akan buat capital reduction bersama-sama dengan proses consolidation.
Dan biasanya, syarikat yang mempunyai BOD yang hanya memiliki peratus saham yang sedikit suka buat consolidation. Ini kerana kesan negatif consolidation banyak ditanggung oleh pelabur runcit berbanding pemegang saham insider.
NOSH yang besar bukan jadi sebab mewajibkan sesebuah syarikat membuat consolidation. Kecualilah:
1. Keadaan kewangan syarikat amat memerlukan consolidation dibuat, contohnya dalam keadaan kerugian terkumpul yang banyak dalam kunci kira-kira.
2. Keadaan harga saham yang terlalu rendah di pasaran akibat masalah share spread yang terlalu besar yang menyebabkan pihak syarikat ingin buat consolidation bagi tujuan memastikan harga di pasaran menjadi lebih tinggi dan menarik minat lebih pihak pelabur institusi dan pelabur runcit untuk membeli saham syarikat tersebut.
3. Kemungkinan “ADA UDANG DISEBALIK BATU” dalam kalangan pengurusan sesebuah syarikat tertentu.
Terdapat segelintir syarikat yang mempunyai pengurusan yang mungkin menggunakan proses consolidation sebagai jalan mudah untuk menyelesaikan masalah dalam syarikat sambil mengaut kepentingan peribadi.
KESIMPULAN DARI SAYA:
1. Dari segi NOSH yang besar dalam Bornoil. Jika NOSH besar, keadaan kewangan okay, harga saham pun OKAY, syarikat tersebut rasanya tak perlu buat consolidation.
Sebagai contoh, lihat saja MY E.G. Bukannya nak buat consolidation tetapi menambahkan lagi jumlah NOSH syarikat sampai 8 bilion unit melalui Bonus Issue.
2. Dari segi FA saya rasa Bornoil masih okay dan menyakinkan:
(a) Syarikat berada dalam keadaan kaya dengan tunai (cash: 4QR 2021, tunai dan Fixed deposit RM35.4 juta) dan hutang (loan) yang kecil.
(b) Syarikat berada dalam keadaan untung. Berasaskan 4QR 2021 report, 4QR 2021, EPS = 0.52 sen sesaham dan untuk FY 2021, EPS = 0.42 sen sesaham.
(c) Keuntungan terkumpul adalah RM86.7 juta, bermaksud wujud excess dalam penilaian bagi nilai sesaham.
(c) NTA berdasarkan 4QR 2021 adalah 11 sen. NTA mempunyai premium yang besar berbanding harga semasa @ 3-3.5 sen. Ini bermaksud, harga 3 -3.5 sen sepatutnya menjadi ""ATTRACTIVE"" untuk pelabur kerana harganya yang berada pada paras diskaun dari nilai sebenar syarikat berasaskan NTA nya yang lebih tinggi.
3. Dari segi prospek perniagaan saya rasa Bornoil juga okay dan berdaya maju:
(a) Mempunyai perniagaan asas dari segi makanannya yang cuba untuk dikembangkan lagi. Masalah sekarang hanya kesan negatif pandemik, dan selepas pandemik kemungkinan syarikat mengembangkan lagi perniagaan makanannya adalah baik.
(b) Beberapa projek pelaburan sedia ada berasakan perlombongan bahan mineral yang belum sepenuhnya direalisasikan termasuk lime stone dan eksplorasi emas (gold). Potensi syarikat dari segi keberuntungan di masa hadapan adalah tinggi.
4. Dari segi share spread dalam Bornoil juga saya rasa okay:
(a) Peratus pegangan saham dalam kalangan “insider” Bornoil lebih kurang 25% dari keseluruhan saham. Bermaksud, masalah share spead yang terlalu besar dalam syarikat boleh dikurangkan.
(b) Kuasa untuk memilih sama ada untuk bersetuju atau tidak terhadap apa-apa cadangan consolidation saham dalam kalangan insider yang mempunyai peratus pegangan saham yang tinggi. Dengan itu, BOD mungkin kurang berkemungkinan untuk menjalankan consolidation saham jika ada bantahan dari pihak pemegang saham insider yang mempunyai kuasa VOTING yang lebih banyak.
SEKADAR UNTUK MAKLUMAT:
1. MY E.G ( 0138 ) NOSH: 3.772 billion (NOSH akan jadi 8 billion selepas Bonus Issue yang akan dibuat tak lama lagi) ---- Harga semasa RM1.94
2. SAPNRG ( 5218 ) NOSH: 15.979 billion ---- Harga semasa RM0.125.
3. Hong Seng ( 0041 ) NOSH 2.457 BILLION ---- Harga semasa RM1.87"

Limestone/ marble mines. These are its largest assets now. Bulk of cash raised went into this segment. Off hand I recall close to 200M cash with guaranteed returns tied in. Clinker plant to be kicked off. All these are tied to the ongoing construction of Pan Borneo highway, which has been oft delayed. As I said before, they often get to recover bad detbs from this segment. There's credibiltiy in this segment. They claim a monopolistic position in the limestone/ clinker plant segment. They are currently short of efficient power supply and addressing logistics issue.
Gold mines. This has always been in play. Last Aug 2020 there was confirmation of gold reserves. May 2021 they bought up rights to the neighbouring gold mine. Also in cash.
For both above segment they require foreign labour/ professionals to come in. Pandemic disruption all on hold.
Fast food/ chili sauce. This drives revenue but has been losing money especially in the current environment. Not well run imho and the brand is quite dated. It's weak, any disposal in this segment is a major catalyst.
Biofraction plant sold for US5M paid in 166M OTC Verde shares. This is the source of this quarter's paper gains.
As you can see, not unlike other companies, Bornoil is also severely disrupted by covid lockdowns.

You're quite right. It's very hard to go below 2.5c because there are simply no sellers. However history can be a reference - you can cut off at the time Hap Seng entered via the rights issue - since then only in Mar 2020 crash there was available a short period below 2.5c. There simply isn't enough stock to push it below 2.5c."

Macbank not yet finishes pp. Don't give high hope. That's all.
But it gives an opportunity for the public to collect at a low price.
Macbank has not yet become a substantial shareholder. All those shares are absorbed into treasury shares. Plus someone helps to 'keep' it 1st since treasury is already full of sbb.
Wait Macbank buyback n announced as substantial shareholder 1st. If not, the price is blocked. Can't move.

To conclude my summary, current price of Bornoil is very low risk. Do not worry about share consolidation, it can be good for Bornoil. Look at PA resources, then you will understand. As long as Bornoil business (gold mining, cement plant operation and bio fraction business)can be materialized, it will fly like rocket to the moon one day."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001255.jsp?ftp=555","Sep 8, 2021 9:11 PM","mhanaS","Dear all.
Firstly I would like to express my gratitude to the participants of this thread for the insightful sharing of this counter. Special mention go to Valgrovest and MZM2511.
For Borneo Oil Beehad (BOB), I sum up the following:
1. This counter is trading near its year-low of 2½sen. The year-high is 5½sen.
2. There is an ongoing PP to MC who have subscribed at prices as low as 2½sen. Without them being a substantial shareholder, it may be true that they are behind the selling pressure at 3 - 3½sen. This exercise of immediate dumping has its pros and cons. On one hand it guarantees a margin spread but on the flip side, if BOB shoots up on perhaps gold or MCO recovery news, the PP subscriber would lose out on a higher profit.
3. There has been record of the CEO acquiring additional shares, generally taken as a good sign.
4. Traces of warrant purchases with a strike price of 7sen give rise to the idea that this counter can shoot up sooner rather than later to make the warrants in the money.
5. The NTA of this counter is 11sen, and currently the candlestick chart indicates this counter price as neutral. This counter has no significant dividend history, and as yet no consolidation or split plans.
6. The latest AR indicates an EPS of 36sen although this was due to a strong Q4 EPS of 52sen.
7. There are 7.955b shares outstanding, excluding warrants and approximately 20% of PP under the MC exercise.
With all these in mind, I conclude the following:
1. The current value of this counter is 2.8sen, including all proposed dilution. There seems to be no willing sellers at 2½sen. The 3sen queue appears very dynamic perhaps due to the PP subscriber managing its sales of shares.
2. There has been a noticable attraction to this counter. This can be seen from the increased queue and trading volume after BOB released its Q4R, and its results were given media attention. I am in the opinion that this counter will gain traction moving forward, especially once the PP subscription exercise is completed.
3. Investors should be tactful in ensuring that we are able to ride on this wave. I am in no position to advise on investment decisions, but I can share with you what I plan to do with this counter, having absorbed all the insightful information.
4. I have set an accumulation strategy with price range of 2½ - 3sen. Any price below seems unrealistic but not impossible. Any price above seems like overkill as long as the PP is in place. This strategy encompasses periodic purchases of shares for a period of twelve months, for a total of 1.2m units of BOB shares. This periodic purchase strategy will average out the cost average and shield me against any sudden price fluctuations.
5. With the warrants strike price and share historical price in mind, I have set a modest yet realistic TP of 5sen within the twelve months investment period. Not excluding fees, this tramslates into a gross yield of 67%. There will be no CL for this investment, all shares will be sold once the term concludes.
Let's rock and roll.
Regards
MHA"

When I concluded on the information or comments given by whistlebower99, some are true, but many are ill intention information, misleading because only try to point on negativity only.
Therefore, the main point should be asked to wistlebower99...
Does he own any shares at any counter he posted his information?
Be noted that he never give answer for this question. But:
1. If his answer is YES, he is a F. O. O. L, because he is trying to burn his own f. o. o. l head.
2. If his answer is NO, he probably has BAD INTENTION on the company and its shareholders"

Lets continue to watch him closely."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001255.jsp?ftp=561","Oct 9, 2021 10:12 AM","Valgrovest","Hi guys, I like to share some thoughts after spending a bit of time reading and trying to understand better on their PP with Mcquarie Bank (MB). MB have clearly stated in the PP Agreement that they do not intend to become major shareholder nor do they wish to participate in the management of the company. That explains why after acquiring about 3/4 of the 1.2bil shares (20% of Bornoil Capital), they never made any announcement on ""Major Shareholder of 5 % or more). Their strategy is to acquire in batches (of course at a discount of up to 10%), quickly sell them and take the profit and use the proceeds to acquire the next batch. It went on and on. They are happy because they made some profit and Bornoil is happy in raising the funds required for their objectives (expansion, new business, working capital, etc). There is a ""Floor Price"" of 2.5sen set in the PP Agreement - so the PP price cannot be lower that 2.5 sen. Hence it is unlikely that the share price will go below 2.5sen as it will not benefit MB or Bornoil. The PP Agreement is for 1 year - so it will end by end JAN22 (another 4 months to go).
Hope you will find the above information useful and do share your thought for the benefit of everyone. We are here to invest and hope to make some money. I think by Feb2022 the share price should slowly go up and that could be the reason why you see Datuk Ambrose Lee buying gradually in advance. Maybe we should reconsider our strategy and buy slowly when the price is low - says 3 sen or if lucky 2.5 sen. Maybe after Feb2022, it wont be at this price anymore."

Yes I think you are right
Further another possibility of the 20% MQ placement is for control, using MQ as a shield. I think it is highly unlikely MQ itself is subscribing and selling for this meagre profit. Refer to its average subscription price of 0.0313 to date and the period it occured. There was rarely a time they could have sold at 3.5-4.0 cents. It is really not that profitable a trade no matter how you look at it. My view is this placement is to distribute shares to operators at a low cost. They have sufficient nominees so that none would appear as substantial shareholders or even in the Top 30
Evidence of Bornoil having a huge number of nominees is from its previous ESOS. From 2017-18, ESOS 747,996,000 shares @ 0.09585. Recall further that they did the ESOS despite a significantly lower market price at the same time. Also note the ESOS then specifically states it cannot be given to directors/ controlling shareholders. So one can see the huge number of nominees subscribing for the shares, and way above market price. Further evidence of this phenomenon is in the auditor's adjustment. Bornoil recognised cost as $0.09585 per ESOS share - auditors disagreed - they put it closer to market price with reference to black-scholes model and lowered it to 6-7 cents if I recall correctly. This reduced Bornoil's cost and as a result affected its bottomline so much that it reported a subsequent loss from a gain."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001255.jsp?ftp=561","Oct 9, 2021 3:11 PM","UncleFollower","And I think you are quite right it can't go below 2.5 cents. To those who are waiting below 2.5 cents it is a long shot. Because really, who has the shares to sell down to 2.0 cents? Even if we are existing shareholders, we should be happy in the event that happens. Only operators are able to flush out weaker shareholders at 0.020 and when they do that it will often precede an eventual huge rebound - so should it come below 0.025 it's a signal that they are almost ready to stage a big move again"

Gold and silver are “supported by increasing worries about problematic price inflation and by a lower U.S. dollar index to end the trading week,” said Jim Wyckoff, senior analyst at Kitco.com, in a daily note. Gold is often perceived as a hedge against rising inflation.

I have few observations. MQ is not listed in any of the top 30 largest shareholders. So the conclusion is they are not holding any big amount of shares and obviously their modus operandi is to sell immediately even at half sen profit. Same goes for ESOS - with such a big amount of ESOS exercised none of the staff are listed in the top 30 largest shareholders. So same modus operandi - they probably sold immediately after exercising even at probably half a sen or a sen profit."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001255.jsp?ftp=563","Nov 1, 2021 2:43 PM","UncleFollower","Another interesting point for u guys to note...
From 1/10/20 to 30/9/21 which is cut-off date as per annual report, there's an increase of approx. 1.25B shares.
This comes from
MQ 977M shares
Plus PP & ESOS 623.605M shares
Total shares increased by approx. 1.6B shares
Less SBB 348.24M shares
Net total shares increaesd by approx. 1.25B shares
That's a lot of shares and some of us here have checked and found that no, MQ is not holding them directly. No new significant shareholders in Top 30. In fact as Justin has pointed out there are only 3-4 new names holding 70M shares or so.
However if u look at shareholders count, the increase is from 23199 to 23239 only in the same period. This means only an increase of 40 shareholders.
So let me tell u this...Bornoil shareholding is not as scattered as it seems...MQ's stake went to a bunch of nominees each holding maybe just less than 20M shares to go below Top30 radar...this means it will be easier than it seems to goreng this up when the right time comes...
This is a very long game in the making...the first round the incredibly priced ESOS went to a very large number of nominees...this is round 2 going to larger nominees...it smells the same as those penny stocks which just exploded one day out of the blue."

State has seen twofold increase in cargo rate in last couple of months
Published on 09 Dec 2021 7:00AM ·
KOTA KINABALU – Higher freight charges and cost of clinker have contributed to increased cement prices in Sabah, the state assembly was told yesterday.
Local Government and Housing Minister Datuk Seri Masidi Manjun said that freight charges to Sabah have gone up nearly twofold the last couple of months, and that the state does not control the prices of clinker as it is traded in the international market.
“The price of clinker is only produced in Peninsular Malaysia and all transactions are done in US dollars.
“This means if our ringgit falls, the cost will be much higher,” said Masidi during his ministerial winding-up speech, here yesterday.
Masidi said this in response to several side questions posed by Sabah opposition leader Datuk Seri Mohd Shafie Apdal (Senallang-Warisan) who had asked about the measures taken by the state government to mitigate cement prices and the surging prices of houses.
To deal with the problem, Masidi said Cement Industries (Sabah) has proposed to set up a one-stop buying centre at its factory to ensure developers and others could buy cement at factory prices.
“I believe the prices of cement in Kota Kinabalu when transported to other areas in Sabah have gone up by around RM3.
“In the previous cabinet meeting, I proposed a retail buying centre so buyers can buy at factory prices,” he said.
Masidi said there’s a need to cut the cost of middlemen, which had contributed to the higher cost of such materials, as well as cutting the cost of building affordable homes.
The Karanaan assemblyman has noted that house prices near the city centre are so expensive, some priced much higher than homes in Kuala Lumpur.
He said when he took over as the housing minister, he had found that the state housing agency, LPPB, does not have much land bank to build affordable homes.
“We have to look for more land for LPPB. I may have found one place. Just probably, the land prices are still reasonable. I'm referring to the land on the old Papar road, which is also along the new Pan Borneo highway,” said Masidi.
Masidi said if the state would be able to acquire the land at a good price along the old Papar road, it could build affordable homes.
He said although Papar is quite a distance from the city, driving time would be shortened and improved once the Pan Borneo Highway is completed.
“This is what I believe. We have to buy land outside of the city centre, but with better road connectivity, the drive from home to work for many workers would be easy,” he said."
