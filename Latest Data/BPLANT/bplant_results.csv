UNAUDITED CONDENSED STATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
#For the quarter ended 31 December 2018
(ii) Proposed Land Acquisition
On 1 August 2018, Boustead Rimba Nilai Sdn Bhd (""BRNSB""), a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company entered into a sale and purchase agreement (""SPA"") with Sit Seng & Sons Realty Sdn Bhd and its related parties for the acquisition of oil palm plantation lands within the District of Beluran, Kinabatangan and Labuk & Sugut comprising 17 land titles measuring a total of 12,144.99 acres (4,915.25 hectares) together with a 75 tonnes per hour palm oil mill and buildings erected thereon as well as movable assets, machineries and vehicles for a cash consideration of RM397 million.
BRNSB has paid a 10% deposit. Conditions precedent set out in the SPA have not been fully fulfilled. The Proposed Acquisition is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2019."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800003588.jsp?ftp=44","Mar 20, 2019 5:19 PM","Patrick13","HIT by high costs and falling crude palm oil (CPO) prices, and digesting a big RM750 million land acquisition, Boustead Plantations Bhd sank to a historic loss in the financial year just ended. But the planter expects the situation to improve this year, although it still has one major land acquisition — with a RM397 million price tag — to pay for soon.
The group tells The Edge that it expects CPO prices to recover, production costs to ease and productivity to improve.
“We may consider lightening our balance sheet through the monetisation of non-core assets as interest expenses are estimated at about RM200 to RM250 per tonne of CPO,” says a company spokesman via email.
With the monetising of non-core assets “with high development potential” on the cards over the next three to four years, the subsequent debt reduction may yield interest savings of RM80 to RM90 per tonne of CPO in the first two years, it adds.
To recap, Boustead Plantations posted a net loss of RM51.78 million for the 2018 financial year ended Dec 31 (FY2018), its first full-year loss since listing in 1973. Revenue fell 23.2% year on year to RM584.01 million.
Its top line came under pressure as CPO prices continued to decline last year, from about RM2,500 per tonne in January to as low as RM1,718 by November.
Costs were also high — the planter was only profitable for 1QFY2018. Maybank Research estimated that the planter’s all-in production costs came to RM2,510 per tonne last year.
The historic loss meant it did not declare a dividend for 4QFY2018, breaking its decades-long track record of paying quarterly dividends.
To be fair, the situation was not unique to Boustead Plantations as some of its peers were also facing a financial squeeze due to similar factors.
However, the falling CPO price environment came at a bad time for Boustead Plantations, which had been shopping for new plantation assets.
One of them was its RM750 million purchase of 11,579.31 acres of plantation land located across 42 parcels in the Beluran district, Sabah, which was completed and paid for on May 16 last year.
The estates were sold by Pertama Land & Development Sdn Bhd, a unit of Dutaland Bhd.
In that quarter, it added RM703.26 million in borrowings to its balance sheet. Between March 31 and June 30, short-term borrowings nearly doubled to RM656.48 million.
It also recorded RM380.81 million in long-term borrowings — the firm did not have long-term borrowings as at March 31, 2017.
As at Dec 31, 2018, its long-term borrowings stood at RM373.09 million, while short-term borrowings amounted to RM744.6 million. Net gearing stood at 0.4 times.
According to Boustead Plantations, the financing costs for the Pertama estates alone came to RM23 million last year, or about RM100 per tonne of CPO.
The group also had to incur start-up expenses for the Pertama estates operations that led to about RM30 per tonne of CPO in net loss, excluding amortisation and financing costs, it added.
In addition, it incurred amortisation charges on land and bearer plants — due to the first-year adoption of the Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards (MFRS) 141 and 116 effective January 2018 — of about RM400 per tonne of CPO last year.
“Excluding the exceptional charges (from MFRS adoption and Pertama estates), our adjusted all-in production costs (would have been) below RM2,000 per tonne in FY2018,” the group says.
The higher average cost was also due to a shortage of harvesters, which led to a 1% y-o-y drop in fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production last year.
Last Thursday, Boustead Plantations’ shares closed at 81.5 sen apiece. The stock has fallen sharply from its one-year peak of RM1.34 per share in mid-May last year to as low as 69 sen by December — a multi-year low."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800003588.jsp?ftp=44","Mar 20, 2019 5:20 PM","Patrick13","Borrowings burden
The group expects to turn itself around this year. Among other issues, it says labour shortages are being addressed by increasing mechanisation while ramping up its labour recruitment drive this year.
Overall, the planter expects FFB output to rise this year with the full-year consolidation of production yield from the Pertama estates. “As Pertama’s production yield improves, unit costs of production are expected to ease in FY2019. Production costs are expected to be lower in FY2019 compared with FY2018.”
It also expects CPO prices to recover and average RM2,450 per tonne this year, supported by an expected reduction in palm oil stocks thanks to Indonesia’s increased biodiesel mandates.
The group also expects lower import duty on crude and refined palm oil in India, as well as China’s positive outlook from the trade dispute with the US to boost CPO prices this year.
However, Boustead Plantations still needs to grapple with its relatively high borrowings — especially short-term — until CPO prices recover and yield from its new estates improves.
The group expects to incur roughly RM56 million in interest expenses this year, which it says remains manageable.
And borrowings are poised to increase soon. The planter is buying another 4,915.25ha of plantation land spread across 17 estates, plus a 75-tonne-per-hour mill.
Of the land area, 4,444ha are planted. That means the average price per planted hectare was RM79,216 — among the highest seen in recent years, according to Maybank Research last August.
Coupled with an old average tree age of 19 years, analysts had raised doubts as to whether it is a prudent acquisition.
The group confirms that of the RM397 million price tag, RM350 million will be via borrowings and that financing has been secured. The deal has seen some delay, but is expected to conclude in the first half of this year.
Asked about the additional short-term cash strain from the looming acquisition, Boustead Plantations says it is taking a long-term view of the return prospects given the scarcity of plantation assets in Malaysia.
In the short term, it is counting on its land disposal in Seberang Perai Utara, Penang, to ease the cash strain on its balance sheet. Slated for completion by 1QFY2019, the group expects RM122 million in proceeds, which should see the return of dividends.
It is also looking to review its short-term financing by increasing the financing tenure over the next 12 months, which means it may be able to lower the interest costs.
“As with all businesses, there are cycles when we have to take on business decisions that may not have an immediate and direct yield,” Bousted Plantations says.
“However, in the long term, given our expertise in the sector and vast proven track record, we expect these acquisitions to contribute handsomely to our bottom line.”

PETALING JAYA (April 24): Boustead Plantations Bhd is looking to pare down its gearing ratio to 0.2 times by 2022, and achieve this target in part by selling plantation land close to urban areas.
At a press conference following its annual general meeting (AGM) today, Boustead Plantations chief executive officer (CEO) Chow Kok Choy said the group's gearing level is around 0.5 times currently, and it is looking to reduce its gearing level via the sale of its plantation land near urban areas during the next three to four years.
""We will have a gearing slightly around 0.5 times. If you are in the plantation business, your gearing should be around 0.2 to 0.3 times.
""We have land with potential property value, and we have quite a number of properties which have got potential. The plan over the next three to four years is to monetise these pieces of land,"" said Chow.
He added that the group is looking to sell plantation land near urban areas because costs associated with the lands' upkeep are high and that the supply of labour to harvest these pieces of land is limited.
When queried on the total land bank that the group is looking to potentially dispose of as property developments, Chow said he could not indicate the actual size of the land, but revealed it was worth between RM1 billion and RM1.2 billion.
Chow added he could not disclose the locations of the plantation plots slated for property development.
When queried as to why the group is looking to purchase more land, Chow said the purchase of more plantation land would allow it to achieve economies of scale.
""Going forward we need size, in our strategy we aim to have 100,000 hectares (ha), currently we have 93,000 ha.
""As an upstream player we are a price taker, if you are not big enough you are not going to be competitive,"" said Chow.
In the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 (FY18), the group had long-term borrowings amounting to RM373.09 million, short-term borrowings of RM744.6 million, and a gearing level of 0.4 times.
The group announced on Aug 1, 2018 that it was purchasing 17 pieces of oil palm plantation land totalling 4,915.25 ha in Sabah, inclusive of a 75 tonne per hour palm oil mill for RM397 million, with the purchase being partly funded by RM350 million in bank borrowings.
At the midday break today, Boustead Plantations rose 0.63% or 0.5 sen to 79.5 sen."

PETALING JAYA: Malaysia’s palm oil exports to China will likely see an additional 20% increase, or about 400,000 tonnes per year, following the latest palm oil supply memorandum of understanding (MoU) witnessed by Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad and China’s Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing.
The additional palm oil purchase by China was part of the re-negotiation between Malaysia-China at at the conclusion of the revised East Coast Rail Link project.
According to industry observers, local palm oil exports to China are expected to jump by about 2.26 million tonnes in 2019 compared with 1.86 million tonnes recorded in 2018.
Under the signed MoU, an additional supply of a minimum of 1.9 million tonnes of palm oil to China over a five-year period, starting from 2019 with the volume estimated at RM4.56bil based on an average price of US$600 per tonne.
“This is a very interesting development as China imports of local palm oil has been on the downtrend in recent years.
“The average purchase price of US$600 per tonne CPO can be considered as a reasonably fair price considering the volatility in the current CPO prices,” said an industry source.
In 2018, China is Malaysia’s third largest palm oil export market at 1.86 million tonnes, after the EU at 1.91 million tonnes and India, the largest export market for Malaysia at 2.51 million tonnes.
Together with Pakistan, the Philippines, Turkey and the US, the top seven markets accounted for 9.31 million tonnes or 56.5% of Malaysia’s total palm oil exports in 2018.
Malaysia’s annual palm oil export volume to China shrank to below three million tonnes after 2015.
The volume was at 3.76 million tonnes in 2011, which was more than Indonesia’s 2.04 million to China.
But since 2015, Indonesia has overtaken Malaysia in terms of export volume of palm oil to China, with the former’s exceeding three million tonnes, while Malaysia’s dropped to 2.44 million tonnes.
On whether China’s additional purchase of local palm oil will to ease the current high inventory situation, an analyst with a local bank-backed brokerage said “I don’t foresee this will help to reduce the bloating global palm oil stocks situation (Malaysia and Indonesia) nor will it help to boost CPO prices higher to trade above RM2,400 per tonne level.”
News of China increasing its palm oil purchases from Malaysia is also not reflected in the trading of CPO futures for June, which ended RM13 lower at RM2,157 per tonne yesterday.
According to the analyst, the current palm oil stocks is currently still too high.
Malaysia’s palm oil inventory alone stood at 2.92 million tonnes as at end-March, while Indonesia is estimated at about 5 million tonnes.
“While the China (purchasing) factor is positive for CPO prices, there will not be a dramatic jump in prices simply because the global palm oil stockpile situation,” he added.
Another potential market-moving factor is on the news that China will invest about RM2bil to set up a biofuel plant in Malaysia.
“This move will likely help to reduce Malaysia palm oil stock in the near future given the ample supply of raw material for the biofuel plant here.”

Boustead Plantation crossed the RM0.78 level in its latest session. With a healthy RSI level, a bullish bias may be present above this mark with a target price of RM0.825, followed by RM0.88. Meanwhile, it may continue moving sideways if it falls back below the RM0.78 mark in the near term. In this case, the immediate support is anticipated at RM0.715, whereby traders may exit on a breach to avoid the risk of a further correction.
Trading Call: Buy on further rebound above RM0.78
Target: RM0.825, RM0.88 (time frame: 3-6 weeks)

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
The Group posted a deficit of RM51 million for the year under review. This was primarily as a result of significantly lower palm product prices which impacted our bottom line. High start-up expenses for the acquisition of 11,579 hectares of land in Sabah and the rehabilitation and improvements for these estates also contributed to the deficit.
Revenue for the year was RM584 million. Market capitalisation stood at RM1.7 billion as at 31 December 2018 and net assets per share came in at RM1.21.
DIVIDEND
Whatever challenges come our way, enhancing value for our shareholders is always a top priority for the Group.
Testament to this, dividend paid for the year was 7 sen per share, reflecting a 9.3% yield based on the closing stock price for the financial year ended 31 December 2018."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800003588.jsp?ftp=45","Apr 27, 2019 10:49 AM","Victor Yong","surely rebound this year :) This is not FGV with so many political baggages, mismanagement, fraud, etc...
OUTLOOK
While 2018 was indeed challenging, the Group is positive on the prospects for 2019, particularly with the CPO market expected to see some recovery in the first half of the year as we enter into the low crop production season and anticipate improved demand from both food and non-food sectors. Although palm oil inventories remain high currently, the biodiesel mandates of Malaysia and Indonesia will help to trim this down to more manageable levels.
In addition, the Indian government’s move to reduce import duties on crude and refined palm oil should further support a recovery in CPO prices. Increased demand from China is also expected to shore up CPO prices.
The Group will place emphasis on increasing overall productivity and focus on cost optimisation to improve our margins going forward.
The Pertama Estates and the proposed acquisition of more than 4,000 ha of adjacent strategically located prime plantation lands with a 75 tonnes per hour palm oil mill will result in a business complex covering over 17,000 ha. This will result in huge cost savings from economies of scale and enhanced operational efficiencies. The proposed acquisition involving a commitment of RM357 million is on track for completion by the first half of 2019.
The Pertama Estates will focus on implementing good agronomic and best management practices as well as the commencement of replanting programme using high yielding oil palm planting materials from 2020 onwards. With these measures in place, we are confident that the Pertama business complex will contribute significantly to the Group’s profitability.
We are conscious that some land may have high development potential and as such, we will monetise these assets at an opportune time. To this end, we are set to dispose of 139 ha of the Malakoff Estate located in Seberang Perai Utara, Pulau Pinang and expect to realise a total estimated gain of RM120 million upon completion of the proposed disposal by the first quarter of 2019.
Planned capital expenditure for 2019 is in the region of RM79 million. We have allocated RM17 million for the installation of dust particulate reduction systems in eight palm oil mills, in compliance with Environment Quality (Clean Air) Regulations 2014. Apart from this, we will invest RM4 million in the Pertama Estates, largely for the construction of workers’ quarters and two schools.
In addition to this, RM56 million will be invested into replanting efforts targeting over 7,200 ha in 2019.
Looking ahead, the Group is well-prepared to tap on new opportunities on the horizon. As we leverage on our strengths to move forward, we are steadfast in our commitment to ensuring the sustainable long-term growth of the Group.

Boustead Plantations to monetise up to RM1.2b of its estates
Boustead Plantations Bhd chief executive officer Chow Kok Choy said the group may sell select oil palm estates near suburbs. NSTP photo by ASYRAF HAMZAH
By Ayisy Yusof - April 24, 2019 @ 7:20pm
KUALA LUMPUR: Boustead Plantations Bhd expects to monetise its selected oil palm estates with a valuation between RM1 billion and RM1.2 billion in the next three to four years.
Chief executive officer Chow Kok Choy said the company could dispose lands that are nearer to towns with the potential for property developments.
“With this monetisation, we can pare down our current borrowings amounting to RM1.4 billion or gearing ratio of 0.5 times to 0.2 times by 2022,” Chow said after Boustead Plantations’ annual general meeting here today.
The group recently completed the disposal of 139 hectares of plantation land with high development potential in Seberang Prai Utara, Pulau Pinang, which will boost its earnings with estimated gains of RM120 million.
Chow said the overall group’s fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production currently stands at 1.0 million tonne annually, leveraging on its 93,000ha of oil palm estates locally.
“However, we aim to reach about 100,000ha of oil palm plantations in the future. We need the estate size to remain competitive and relevant in this industry,” he added.
He said the company’s land bank expansion was in tandem with its goals to improve productivity and yields.
On average, Boustead Plantations’ incurred about RM1,664 production cost per tonne last year.
Chow expects crude palm oil (CPO) to be conservatively priced between RM2,200 and RM2,300 per tonne this year.
“CPO prices are projected to recover in the next few months as we enter into the low crop production season.
“This will further supported by the reduction in palm oil stocks, driven by biodiesel mandates for Malaysia and Indonesia, lower import duties on crude and refined palm oil by India and increasing demand from China,” he said.
The projection is also based on potential outcome of the US-China trade war dispute that could impede the consumption of soybean oil from China. CPO has correlation with the soybean for the vegetable oil market.
Chow said the EU’s plan to ban palm oil-based biodiesel by 2030 could hamper demand in the region and affect the prices.
He said the group would comply with the EU’s requirement standard for the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification by 2022.
Boustead Plantations posted a net loss of RM51.78 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 (FY18), compared with a net profit of RM620.17 million a year ago, while revenue dropped 23.2 per cent to RM584.01 million from RM760.10 million."

China’s jump in demand for green fuel seen boosting palm oil
PLANTATIONS
Friday, 29 Mar 2019
SINGAPORE/KUALA LUMPUR: A surge in demand for biofuel in China and in Europe -- despite controversial new rules in the bloc that may limit sales -- is proving a bright spot for palm oil, which has been plagued by mounting stockpiles in Malaysia.
Shipments of palm methyl ester, a kind of biodiesel made from palm oil, climbed from Southeast Asia in the first quarter as Malaysian exports improved, according to consultancy PRIMA.
The main reason is the widening gap between the price of Brent crude, which has jumped 27 percent in the first three months, and palm oil, which is little changed.
“China started buying, and the flows are seen to be healthy in the next several months,” though they still depend on gasoil prices, said PRIMA’s Singapore-based analyst Heather Zhang.
“The arbitrage opened in February with the plunging prices, which makes palm more attractive to European buyers versus other feedstock such as waste-based biodiesel.”
The increase in shipments is a rare bright spot for growers in Malaysia and Indonesia, who saw palm prices slide more than 8 percent in the past two months amid concerns over the size of inventories and lackluster demand. Benchmark futures in Kuala Lumpur traded at 2,107 ringgit a ton on Friday.
The decline obliterated gains made in January, and also came as the European Union moved to cap the amount of palm-based biofuel that can be counted toward its renewable-energy goals.
Farmers have lambasted the proposal, while Indonesia and Malaysia governments have threatened to retaliate.
Enticing Arb
Shipments of palm methyl ester from Malaysia and Indonesia to Europe probably climbed more than 30 percent to 145,000 metric tons in the first quarter, Zhang said, citing her analysis and discussions with industry executives.
The export flow out of Malaysia alone could reach 100,000 tons this month, including shipments to the EU and China, she said.
Palm’s discount to gasoil, or diesel, reached about $106 a ton on March 14, the widest since November, and was at $91 Friday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with an average discount of about $66 over 2018.
The gap needs to widen to $120 for buyers in some other markets to purchase more, according to Sathia Varqa, owner of Palm Oil Analytics in Singapore.
China’s PME imports grew almost 50-fold to 751,056 tons last year, thanks to the low prices, Chinese customs data show.
The country has pledged to increase its use of alternative energy, including solar power and biofuel, to cut fossil fuel emissions. At least five cargoes have been booked to ship 30,000 to 50,000 tons of PME to China for March-May delivery, according to PRIMA.
Chinese buyers want to purchase more biodiesel for May and June delivery, but they’re facing difficulties because Indonesia’s plant capacity is being fully used, according to Rajesh Modi, a trader at Sprint Exim Pte.
Indonesian facilities are fully committed because the country increased mandates that require more palm-based biodiesel in its fuel mix.- Bloomberg

Malaysia mulling fund setup to stabilise biodiesel prices, says Kok
Tan Xue Ying

theedgemarkets.com
February 12, 2019 11:30 am +08
PUTRAJAYA (Feb 12): Malaysia is mulling the possibility of setting up a fund to help contain future price fluctuations of biodiesel — comprising diesel and crude palm oil (CPO) — in ensuring that the programme remains attractive for domestic consumption, according to Primary Industries Minister Teresa Kok.
Kok told reporters on the sidelines of an industry forum held here today that the idea was brought up at a Cabinet meeting and further discussions are to follow.
“I have sort of suggested this in the Cabinet meeting before, but we still need deeper discussions with other ministries [such as the] Ministry of Finance, Prime Minister’s Department, Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and all other [relevant] ministries.
“We can also check how Indonesia and Thailand implement such systems and set up a stabilisation fund, and we can emulate them,” she added.
Meanwhile, Kok said the Ministry will have officers inspecting petrol stations throughout the country for compliance checks, as the mandatory B10 programme commenced on Feb 1.
Together with the B7 programme for the industrial sector starting in June, the mandates are said to help reduce high stock levels and encourage stable and better CPO prices by mopping up 761,000 tonnes of palm oil annually.
At 10.47 am, the benchmark palm oil contract for May delivery was traded RM9 lower, at RM2,276 a tonne."

Crude oil could rise to US$80 a barrel in 2H19
Thursday, April 25th, 2019 at , Business | Economy
Expectations that US and China are close to reaching a trade deal and the latter’s economy stabilising will boost energy demand
by MARK RAO/ BLOOMBERG PIC
CRUDE oil could rise to US$80 (RM330.40) per barrel as tightening supply, renewed demand prospects and brewing geopolitical events provide a respite to Malaysia’s revenue concerns.
Brent oil has rallied close to 38% year-to-date and risen to trade above the US$74 per barrel mark as OPEC and its allies continue to influence supplies.
Rising expectations that Washington and Beijing are close to reaching a trade deal and China’s economy stabilising would boost energy demand. China, the world’s second-largest consumer of oil with more than 13.2 million barrels a day, needs the fuel to power its economy and over 1.4 billion population.
FXTM market analyst Han Tan said Brent could rise to US$80 per barrel in the second half of 2019 (2H19).
“Based on the supply-demand dynamics that we are seeing right now, I still think there is more room for upside for oil,” he said during a media briefing in Kuala Lumpur yesterday.
He believes that oil prices could peak in 1H19 if there is no drastic changes to the supply or demand equilibrium.
Han said events in June would provide a better gauge of how oil will perform going into 2019, especially on how OPEC and countries allied to the cartel respond to the end of US waivers on Iran in May.
The waivers, coupled with the growing geopolitical concerns in Venezuela and Libya, are impacting oil production and pushing the oil rally observed this year.
OPEC and their partners, who control about 55% of global oil supply, are committed to tightening oil supply until June this year, but potential output deficits from Iran and other oil-producing nations could prompt producers to fill any shortfall.
Oanda Corp senior market analyst Jeffrey Halley said expectations that Saudi Arabia, the largest OPEC oil producer, will hold off any production increase boosted Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) contracts yesterday.
“Oil continued its Iran induced ascent overnight. Brent crude climbed 0.6% to US$74.50 a barrel and WTI rose an impressive 1.15% to US$66.30 a barrel, both six-month highs,” he said in a research note yesterday.
“The black gold was supported by rumours that Saudi Arabia would not necessarily open the oil spigots to make up for an Iranian shortfall, preferring
to wait until it saw concrete evidence of such demand.”
An oil price rally would help boost the ringgit and the government’s budget this year which calculated expenses based on US$70 per barrel.
The government, which is working towards refinancing its over RM1 trillion debt, is expected to recognise additional revenue if oil prices average
above its budget as Malaysia remains dependent on oil revenue despite the percentage to the GDP has come down.
Han said it is estimated that for every US$1 rise above US$70 per barrel will translate into an additional RM300 million to the government and
likewise, a drop of US$1 would have the same quantum impact.
Higher average oil prices will also benefit Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) as the national energy company indicated that it is budgeting for future projects at US$66 per barrel on the Brent index.
Petronas’ upstream business will be boosted with the higher oil prices.
However, Han said global growth remains tilted towards the downside and could weigh on the crude oil rally.
“The lingering uncertainties on the demand side of the equation, given the delicate state of global economic conditions, continue to weigh down on oil and threaten to upend efforts by OPEC and its allies to re-balance the global oil markets,” he said.
He added that US President Donald Trump, who repeatedly stated his preference for lower oil prices, remains a “wild card” in the oil market.
This is especially true if Trump continues to put pressure on other oil producers to prevent prices from climbing higher, he said."

US sanctions on Iran, Venezuela set up crunch for heavier oil
OIL & GAS
Monday, 29 Apr 2019
7:08 AM MYT
This month Iraq's SOMO sold 2 million barrels of Basra Heavy crude to China's Unipec at a premium of over $2 a barrel to its official selling price (OSP), the highest in months, sources said.
This month Iraq's SOMO sold 2 million barrels of Basra Heavy crude to China's Unipec at a premium of over $2 a barrel to its official selling price (OSP), the highest in months, sources said.
LONDON: Tighter U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil planned for May are adding to a wealth of factors curbing global supply of heavy-medium crude, driving up prices for scarcer barrels and setting up a stand-off between buyers and sellers.
The new curbs on Iranian exports come on top of Washington's earlier ban on Venezuelan crude and output snags in Angola, another big producer of the dense crude grades that best yield lucrative refined products like jet fuel.
Refiners are also seeking more of the heavy sweet crude Iran and Venezuela once provided in abundance to produce low-sulfur fuel oil ahead of new shipping emissions rules due next year.
U.S. officials say overall global oil supply will remain plentiful despite its sanctions, not least from the boom in U.S. shale. But much of the profusion in supply, led by the United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia, is in lighter grades.
The price for heavier crudes like Norway's Grane and Heidrun has been firming over the last few months, a North Sea trader said. Over April, the price of Grane rose from around dated Brent plus 10 cents to close to dated Brent plus $1.00 a barrel.
This month Iraq's SOMO sold 2 million barrels of Basra Heavy crude to China's Unipec at a premium of over $2 a barrel to its official selling price (OSP), the highest in months, sources said.
Price offerings for several Angolan streams, an approximate alternative to Iranian and Venezuelan crude, were at their highest ever, traders said.
State oil company Sonangol was said to have sold a cargo of one of its heaviest grades, Dalia, over the last week for $2 a barrel above dated Brent, a $7 increase from two years ago. Typically, the grade trades at a discount of $1 or more.
BUYERS RESIST
While some clients are prepared to buy at elevated prices, others are holding back. ""We're resisting it as much as possible,"" one potential buyer said.
Some of Sonangol's regular customers balked at the mark-ups, prompting the company to offer the crude to other buyers instead as spot cargoes. These have sold quickly, trading sources said.
The current stand-off between buyers and sellers comes down partly to uncertainty over just how much Iranian crude may still flow, crucially to top consumer China, after the May 1 deadline the U.S. has imposed for importers to halt purchases.
China's foreign ministry this week said Beijing had formally complained to the United States about the move.
Analysts expect China may flout the restrictions, especially since Washington may be loath to sanction Chinese companies importing Iranian crude which are at the same time key buyers of U.S. oil and liquid natural gas.
Sweden's SEB says Beijing could lift its imports of Iranian crude in the coming months from some 600,000 barrels per day in March to around 1 million bpd, bucking U.S. pressure, while exports elsewhere under the sanctions radar could reach another 500,000 bpd.
That would make it harder for sellers to get away with higher prices.
""Decisions on buying will be easier to make when it's clearer how much Iranian (crude) will still be flowing,"" a trading source said. - Reuters"

JAKARTA: Indonesia's palm oil output in March likely rose from a month earlier, while inventories were seen lower on the back of a pickup in exports and domestic consumption, according to a Reuters survey.
Palm oil output in top producer Indonesia was seen rising to 3.95 million tonnes in March from 3.80 million tonnes in the previous month, according to the median results of a survey of two palm oil groups and a state palm research firm.
Exports were seen at 2.93 million tonnes last month, compared with 2.88 million tonnes in February.
Domestic consumption of palm oil likely increased to 1.51 million tonnes last month from 1.26 million tonnes a month earlier, the survey median showed.

Boustead Plantations Berhad (""BPB"") is one of the most experienced and established upstream oil palm plantation company in Malaysia and a subsidiary of Boustead Holdings Berhad (""BHB""), one of Malaysia's oldest and largest diversified conglomerates. Backed by BHB's presence in the plantations business, we have over 100 years of plantations industry experience and over 50 years of oil palm plantation estate management experience.
We are an investment holding company and are involved in the ownership of oil palm plantations. Through our subsidiaries, we are principally involved in the ownership and management of oil palm plantations, cultivation of oil palm and harvesting of its Fresh Fruit Bunches (""FFBs""), and the production and sale of Crude Palm Oil (""CPO"") and Palm Kernel (""PK""). We also sell oil palm FFBs and provide mill design and consultancy services. We are also actively involved in oil palm agricultural and agronomic research through our associate company.
We own, co-own or lease a total of 41 oil palm plantation estates and 10 palm oil mills in Malaysia with 19 plantation estates in Peninsular Malaysia, 13 in Sabah and 9 in Sarawak. We own and operate 4 palm oil mills in Peninsular Malaysia, 4 in Sabah and 2 in Sarawak. Our total landbank stands approximately at 82,500 Ha. Out of this total, the area under oil palm cultivation is around 64,500 Ha comprising of 24,900 Ha in Peninsular Malaysia, 27,200 Ha in Sabah and 12,400 Ha in Sarawak.
Our involvement in the plantations business is carried out via our wholly-owned subsidiary, Boustead Estates Agency Sdn Bhd (""BEA""), a central agency which provides a range of services such as the management of all plantation activities within our Group, plantation advisory services for oil palm and rubber crops, plantation engineering services, marketing of plantation produce and agronomic research.
“Whereas our involvement in the oil palm agricultural and agronomic research is through our associate company, Applied Agricultural Resources Sdn Bhd (""AAR""). AAR provides agronomic advisory services and commercial production of oil palm planting materials namely AA Hybrida IS, oil palm hybrid semi-clonal seeds, is produced through a pedigree of selected elite clonal Deli Dura and the Dumpy Yangambi AVROS pisifera. This pisifera is the combination of the highly successful and renowned dumpy characteristic of AAR’s previous hybrid (the Dumpy AVROS) with the high bunch number characteristics of the Yangambi AVROS. The end result is an oil palm variety with 22% more oil yield compared to AAR’s previous AA DxP planting materials. For more information on AA Hybrida IS, please visit AAR website.
AAR-UNMC Biotechnology Research Centre, is a collaboration between AAR and the University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus. This has resulted in a new state-of-the-art biotechnology research centre which is primarily involved in the development of oil palm, with a focus in genetic improvement through modern bio molecular marker techniques. The research areas being explored include the application of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) finger printing and genetic improvement programmes.overview
The main goals of the research centre are to develop genetic engineering technology to overcome the barriers of introducing new traits into oil palm and speed up the production of new oil palm hybrid with desirable traits, such as high value oil, disease resistance and amenability to mechanise harvesting using marker assisted selection and tissue culture.
The Group's commitment in pursuing sustainable practices is on-going. As of to date the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil certification has been obtained for Sungai Jernih Business Unit and Nak Business Unit which consist of one (1) mill and three (3) estates respectively."

We were incorporated as a public limited company under the name The Kuala Sidim Rubber Company, Limited, on 4 July 1946 in the Federation of Malaya (""Malaya"") under the Companies Ordinance 1910. We were at the time involved in the cultivation of rubber and management of rubber plantation estates in Malaya, where our rubber plantations were located in Peninsular Malaya.
On 15 April 1966, we changed our name to The Kuala Sidim Rubber Company Berhad. Subsequently, on 12 December 1994, we changed our name to Kuala Sidim Berhad, and on 10 April 2004, we changed our name to Boustead Plantations Berhad (""BPB"").
In the 1960s, we began converting our rubber crops into oil palm. In July 1969, Barlow Boustead Estates Agency Limited (""BBEA""), a plantation management agency company, became our substantial shareholder and assumed the role of managing agent for our plantation estates.
We were listed on both Bursa Securities (formerly known as Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange) and the Singapore Stock Exchange on 1 August 1973. Also in 1973, we expanded into agricultural research and advisory services through the establishment of Highland Research Unit Sdn Bhd ( ""HRU""), a joint venture research unit between Highlands & Lowlands Berhad and Selangor Coconuts Berhad (""SCB""), which was then our listed plantation-based subsidiary, and us.
Beginning from the late 1970s through the 1980s, we began acquiring landbank, as well as oil palm plantation estates, in Sabah, including from other plantation estate owners for whom BBEA was acting as managing agent. Between February 1982 and May 1982, our current holding company, Boustead Holdings Berhad (""BHB""), acquired all the interest held in BBEA from BBEA's shareholders, including Lembaga Tabung Angkatan Tentera (""LTAT""), Lembaga Tabung Haji, FELDA and members of the Barlow family, and renamed it Boustead Estates Agency Sdn Bhd (""BEA""), after which BEA became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BHB. In May 1983, BHB acquired all of BEA's equity interest in our Company. In the meantime, BEA continued to be the managing agent for all our plantation assets.
In 1986, we co-founded Applied Agricultural Resources Sdn Bhd (""AAR"") (then known as Applied Agricultural Research Sdn Bhd), also an agricultural research and advisory services unit, in a joint-venture partnership with Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad. In May 1987, we disposed of our entire interest in HRU.
In line with the then national policy of promoting the listing of Malaysian public listed companies on Bursa Securities, we were delisted from the Singapore Stock Exchange effective 1 January 1990.
In April 1993, we embarked on a rationalisation exercise together with our parent company BHB and our subsidiaries SCB and Malakoff Berhad. Following that exercise, we became the principal listed vehicle for the BHB Group's plantation interests. In March 1994, we disposed virtually our entire interest in Malakoff Berhad but acquired all of the latter's estates (with the exception of Windsor Estate) and its shareholdings in Ladang Segaria Sdn Bhd. The said acquisition enabled us to expand our directly-owned plantation landbank and consolidate our plantation interests.
In 1994 and 1998, we expanded our oil palm business into Sarawak via a joint venture agreement with Land Custody and Development Authority of Sarawak (""Pelita""), which in latter year via Pelita Holdings Sendirian Berhad for the development of plantation land in Sarawak.
On 29 August 2003, we were delisted from Bursa Securities following a takeover offer made by BHB on 10 March 2003 to acquire our remaining shares it did not already own, then known as Kuala Sidim Berhad (""Kuala Sidim Share"").
Following the completion of the privatisation of our Company in 2003, we had embarked on various corporate exercise that would enable the BHB Group to rationalise, consolidate and streamline the plantation activities undertaken by BHB and our Company in stages.
On 16 July 2013 we initiated the privatisation of AI-Hadharah Boustead REIT (""BREIT"") to provide an avenue to merge and streamline all of the plantation assets in our Group under one entity, namely us, which will enable us to raise funds and access the equity capital market, as well as provide us greater financial flexibility to pursue further growth opportunities.
As the final step in the streamlining process, we acquired the entire equity interest in BEA from BHB on 1 July 2013, thus consolidating the management nucleus of BHB Group's entire plantation operations under our Group."

Malaysian palm oil output levels for January, February and March have set monthly records, according to Refinitiv Eikon records going back to January 2000.
Mistry raised his Malaysian output forecast based on this so-called high-cycle of production that has lasted from about August 2018 until March. After this burst of cultivation, the trees will need to rest, limiting production in the rest of 2019.
""Malaysia will be hurt more by production problems in 2019 due to the older age of its plantations,"" Mistry said, according to a copy of his speech at a conference in Dubai reviewed by Reuters.
""Older trees are suffering from stress due to high productivity in 2018,"" said Mistry, adding that low prices had also caused small growers to cut fertilizer usage from last August.
Benchmark palm oil prices on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange have traded in a range this year roughly between 2,300 ringgit and 2,000 ringgit per tonne. The most-active contract closed on Monday down 0.4 percent at 2,109 ringgit ($510.41).
Mistry maintained his forecasts for Indonesian output at 44 million tonnes in 2019, and that global palm oil production would rise by less than 3 million tonnes this year.
He also kept estimates that combined palm oil inventories in Indonesia and Malaysia, the world's two biggest palm cultivators, will decline to 6 million tonnes ""soon"" due to biodiesel mandates for transportation fuels in the Southeast Asian nations.
""Thanks to the B20 biodiesel mandate and its strong implementation in Indonesia, stocks there are comfortable,"" said Mistry, adding that Malaysian stocks should fall from April to June before recovering.
The Indonesia Palm Oil Association said palm oil production was 43 million tonnes for 2018, while the Malaysian Palm Oil Board reported last year's output at 19.5 million tonnes.
In terms of demand, Mistry revised his forecasts for India's edible oil imports for the 2018/19 marketing year that started on Nov. 1 to 15.5 million tonnes. This is slightly down from a January outlook of 15.7 million tonnes and versus imports of 15 million tonnes the previous year.
""Indian imports 2018/2019 will be higher by 500,000 tonnes. (The) main increase will be palm,"" he said.

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800003588.jsp?ftp=46","May 2, 2019 10:16 AM","Victor Yong","BANTING: After having warned the European Union that Malaysia would retaliate if it continued with its ban on Malaysian palm oil, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad today said that one of the retaliatory measures could be Malaysia switching to China for its fighter jets.
“If they keep on taking action against us (banning our palm oil), we will think of buying airplanes from China or any other country,“ he told a press conference after launching the “Love our Palm Oil” campaign in Ladang East, Sime Darby Plantations, Pulau Carey, here today.
Also present was Primary Industries Minister Teresa Kok and Energy, Land and Natural Resources Minister Dr Xavier Jayakumar.
Dr Mahathir, however, stressed that he was not “declaring war” on the EU as the country still needed goods from the union.
Thus, he said any action to reduce or stop imports from EU countries would not be done in haste but the impact on the nation would be studied first.
The European Parliament is reported to be in the process of banning the use of palm oil for biofuel, while the retail networks in Britain and Iceland have announced that they will stop using the commodity.
Malaysia is the top producer of palm oil in the world. Malaysia and Indonesia by themselves produce almost 90% of the world’s palm oil.
Anti-palm oil lobbyists are claiming that oil palm cultivation is causing deforestation and contributing to the haze problem when in fact Malaysia practises sustainable oil palm cultivation.
Dr Mahathir said the anti-palm oil campaign by European countries would have an impact on Malaysian palm oil exports even though they were not the biggest importers.
“Anti-palm oil sentiments in Europe against Malaysia are very strong ... export of the commodity (from Malaysia) will be affected even though it is not our biggest market,” he said.
On the Philippines, which is seeking a temporary halt on palm oil imports from Malaysia and Indonesia, Dr Mahathir said the government would hold negotiations to resolve the matter.
Earlier, in his speech, Dr Mahathir expressed his disappointment that European food producers were labelling more of their products with ‘No Palm Oil’, describing it as a propaganda attempt to protect their markets.
“They do not give attention to (Malaysian) workers in oil palm plantations. We have about 600,000 employees who will lose their jobs if oil palm plantations close down,” he said.
The Prime Minister said claims by European countries that oil palm cultivation would affect the forests and wildlife like tigers, elephants as well as orangutans were not true.
He also refuted allegations that palm oil was poisonous, saying attempts to show that palm oil should not be included in food was unacceptable.
“To control their (European nations’) edible oil market, they will make allegations that palm oil is dangerous for consumption and unhealthy,” he said.
Commenting on his recent visit to Pakistan, Dr Mahathir said he watched China-made fighter aircraft participating in an aerobatic show and was impressed.
“If we have to buy fighter jets, we will consider these China-made jets,” he said, adding that the China-made jets’ technology had surpassed western technology.
Teresa Kok, in her speech, said the Cabinet had approved a proposal to limit the expansion of oil palm plantations in the country to 6.5 million ha as a step towards ensuring the sustainability of the palm oil industry.
“In addition, the Cabinet also agreed that oil palm cultivation should not be encouraged in peat soils, while changing the use of Permanent Forest Reserves land for the cultivation of oil palm or other agricultural crops is prohibited,” she said.
A total of 4,000 invitees from various walks of life attended the inaugural campaign, which is aimed at raising public awareness on the role of palm oil in the country’s socio-economy. — Bernama

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800003588.jsp?ftp=46","May 2, 2019 10:26 AM","Victor Yong","KUALA LUMPUR, April 27 — Teresa Kok has admitted that the palm oil war with the European Union (EU) is her toughest challenge yet since being appointed Primary Industries Minister, overseeing Malaysia’s commodities.
No newbie to criticism, the seasoned politician is rolling up her sleeves to combat the issue so as to proof why Malaysia’s palm oil production is not as bad as claimed.
However, Kok said that more needs to be done, and this can only be made possible with support from Malaysians.
“In this one year, among the main challenges I faced is managing the anti-palm oil campaign.
“We believe that our efforts to reject this anti-palm oil campaign will only work if Malaysians trust and appreciate Malaysian palm oil,” Kok told a special interview to commemorate Pakatan Harapan’s (PH) first year in Putrajaya, after defeating Barisan Nasional (BN) on May 9 last year.
“By mid term, it will be 2021. So by 2021, the European Union (EU) has to review the delegated regulation,” she added.
Kok said that despite being trolled online owing to Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s remark urging Malaysians to drink one spoon of palm oil daily for their health, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise.
“I understand people make fun. Especially about the part advising them to drink one spoon of palm oil daily.
“However, because of the statement of the prime minister, it gave me an opportunity to introduce the red palm oil, which is full of Vitamin A and Vitamin E. All these while, this was also not known to many, especially to even Malaysians.
“That’s why when I was teased by social media users, with some even posing, pretending to drink their cooking oil and many other antics which we saw on Facebook, I accepted it all well, because indirectly, they actually helped by drawing more interest from the public towards the ‘Love My Palm Oil’ campaign,” she said.
Kok also hopes that Malaysian palm oil can penetrate more global markets, pointing to Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Japan as targets.
“I see that we have a lot of potential to go into new markets, but when we want to penetrate into the market, when we want to brand our palm oil better than others, we must make sure the industry should follow all the rules and regulations,” she added.
Last December, France’s National Assembly voted to end tax incentives for palm oil biodiesel by 2020, followed later that month by Norway’s parliament’s plan to ban biofuels with palm oil also by 2020.
In 2017, the EU Parliament had banned the use of palm oil in all European biofuels by 2020, citing environmental concerns.
Malaysia had strongly criticised the move, calling the EU’s decision unfair.
Last month, Dr Mahathir said that Putrajaya may stop buying goods from EU member states if the bloc proceeds with its plan to ban Malaysian-made palm oil products.
The prime minister said PH leaders had a consensus that the federal government must be more aggressive to protect the country’s oil palm industry.
The call for retaliation would take place if the EU proceeds to implement the Delegated Act to phase out and ban palm biodiesel.
The proposed EU Delegated Act — slated to be tabled before the European Parliament in April 2019 — supplements the EU Renewable Energy Directive II to restrict and ban palm oil biofuel altogether by 2030.
In January, Dr Mahathir had written a letter to French President Emmanuel Macron and said that Malaysia would look into laws to restrict imports of French products if it did not withdraw plans to ban palm biodiesel.
How would she rate her performance?
During the interview, Kok said she left it to the industry players and the people to rate her performance as Cabinet minister.
“Actually I don’t want to rate myself because I think the rakyat should rate us.
“It’s just that you don’t give yourself examination and give yourself 100 per cent. Actually it should be others.
“I think that the industry players should rate. I think that those who are watching what this minister is doing, that should give the mark,” she added.

KUALA LUMPUR: Boustead Plantations Bhd expects to monetise its selected oil palm estates with a valuation between RM1 billion and RM1.2 billion in the next three to four years.
Chief executive officer Chow Kok Choy said the company could dispose lands that are nearer to towns with the potential for property developments.
“With this monetisation, we can pare down our current borrowings amounting to RM1.4 billion or gearing ratio of 0.5 times to 0.2 times by 2022,” Chow said after Boustead Plantations’ annual general meeting here today.
The group recently completed the disposal of 139 hectares of plantation land with high development potential in Seberang Prai Utara, Pulau Pinang, which will boost its earnings with estimated gains of RM120 million.
Chow said the overall group’s fresh fruit bunch (FFB) production currently stands at 1.0 million tonne annually, leveraging on its 93,000ha of oil palm estates locally.
“However, we aim to reach about 100,000ha of oil palm plantations in the future. We need the estate size to remain competitive and relevant in this industry,” he added.
He said the company’s land bank expansion was in tandem with its goals to improve productivity and yields.
On average, Boustead Plantations’ incurred about RM1,664 production cost per tonne last year.
Chow expects crude palm oil (CPO) to be conservatively priced between RM2,200 and RM2,300 per tonne this year.
“CPO prices are projected to recover in the next few months as we enter into the low crop production season.
“This will further supported by the reduction in palm oil stocks, driven by biodiesel mandates for Malaysia and Indonesia, lower import duties on crude and refined palm oil by India and increasing demand from China,” he said.
The projection is also based on potential outcome of the US-China trade war dispute that could impede the consumption of soybean oil from China. CPO has correlation with the soybean for the vegetable oil market.
Chow said the EU’s plan to ban palm oil-based biodiesel by 2030 could hamper demand in the region and affect the prices.
He said the group would comply with the EU’s requirement standard for the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification by 2022.
Boustead Plantations posted a net loss of RM51.78 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 (FY18), compared with a net profit of RM620.17 million a year ago, while revenue dropped 23.2 per cent to RM584.01 million from RM760.10 million."

Kok said the tax-free window period would enable the industry to plan more carefully on how to raise exports and open new markets for Malaysia’s palm oil.
""The exemption is given even though the cpo price hits RM2,250 per metric tonne and above, the level when the duty is applicable,” she said in a statement here today.
She said her ministry is very concerned about the industry’s current situation with the palm oil stock level at 2.92 million tonnes on March 31, 2019 and the cpo price on April 26, 2019 at RM2,014.50 per tonne.
""In such a situation, pro-active measures should be taken to enhance the palm oil industry’s competitiveness,” she said.
The ministry also hopes the zero-duty CPO export scheme could lower the palm oil stock level and increase the nation’s cpo prices, she said.
""These measures would help the palm oil industry including smallholders nationwide,” she said, adding the ministry would also continue to monitor the stock level to ensure there is enough supply to meet the needs of the country’s downstream palm oil industry.
Meanwhile, speaking to Bernama on the sidelines of the 6th Singapore Dialogue on Sustainable World Resources here today, Kok said: ""This is something that the government has to help the industry in that manner. If the price is low, the palm oil stock is high and the government doesn't get anything too.""
She was asked how much tax revenue that the government has to forego by placing the tax-free exemption on the export duty of the commodity until Dec 31, 2019.
Kok earlier delivered her keynote address on “Connecting Markets, Forging Consensus: Partnerships for Sustainable Palm Oil”."

Indonesia resumed exports of biodiesel to Europe early last year, after the World Trade Organization (WTO) had ruled in its favour on several challenges Jakarta made on previous anti-dumping duties imposed by the EU on its biodiesel shipments.
Indonesia resumed exports of biodiesel to Europe early last year, after the World Trade Organization (WTO) had ruled in its favour on several challenges Jakarta made on previous anti-dumping duties imposed by the EU on its biodiesel shipments.
JAKARTA: The Indonesia Biodiesel Producers Association (APROBI) estimates the country may export up to 2 million kilolitres (kl) of unblended biodiesel in 2019 in an ""optimistic scenario"", Vice Chairman Paulus Tjakrawan told reporters on Thursday.
In a ""pessimistic scenario"", he said biodiesel exports this year would be around 1 million to 1.2 million kl. This compares with exports of 1.78 million kl of biodiesel last year.
The ""pessimistic scenario"" takes into consideration the European Union (EU) setting countervailing duties on Indonesian biodiesel this year, Tjakrawan said, after it launched an anti-subsidy investigation on the Indonesian biofuel in late 2018.
Indonesia resumed exports of biodiesel to Europe early last year, after the World Trade Organization (WTO) had ruled in its favour on several challenges Jakarta made on previous anti-dumping duties imposed by the EU on its biodiesel shipments.
In the first quarter this year, Indonesia's overall biodiesel exports were 173,542 kl, association data showed, up 78 percent from the same period last year. The shipments were mostly headed to the EU and China.
In Indonesia's domestic market, first-quarter consumption of biodiesel more than doubled to 1.5 million kl from 659,813.51 kl a year earlier, APROBI data showed on Thursday.
Consumption of the palm oil-based fuel jumped after Indonesian government made the use of B20 fuel mandatory. That's diesel with a 20 percent biodiesel component.
Indonesia estimates 6.2 million kl of domestic biodiesel consumption in 2019.
APROBI Chairman M.P. Tumanggor said the government aims to soon conduct a road test for B30 biodiesel, containing a 30 percent bio component.
""According to schedule, (the test) will go on until September, but we want to speed it up to (finish) in July,"" Tumanggor said.
APROBI estimated that B30 implementation would increase domestic consumption of biodiesel to as much as 10 million kl.
According to government regulations, road vehicles will have to start using B30 fuel from 2020, although an energy ministry official has said the implementation schedule will depend on the results of the road test. - Reuters

Suspension of CPO export duties to clear high stock level
Analyst Reports
Friday, 3 May 2019
8:59 AM MYT
Malaysia’s move to suspend export duties on crude palm oil (CPO) until Dec 31, 2019 will help to improve Malaysia’s CPO export competitiveness to clear the nation's current high stock level, CIMB Equities Research said.
KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia’s move to suspend export duties on crude palm oil (CPO) until Dec 31, 2019 will help to improve Malaysia’s CPO export competitiveness to clear the nation's current high stock level, CIMB Equities Research said.
The suspension follows Indonesia’s decision to revise its CPO export levy structure and keep levies at zero till end-May 2019.
The research house said on Friday currently, CPO exports from Malaysia enjoy zero export tax as the CPO price is below RM2,250 per tonne.
The Primary Industries Minister Teresa Kok was quoted saying the move was expected to encourage CPO exports and indicated that African countries, Middle Eastern nations, and Russia are interested in buying Malaysian CPO.
She also indicated that palm oil producers have complained about the lack of foreign workers, and taxes during her recent dialogue session with planters in Sandakan.
“The decision to suspend export duties on CPO for the rest of the year was a slight surprise to us, timing wise, but not totally unexpected.
“This is because the Primary Industries Minister had in Oct 2018 revealed that revising the CPO export duty would be among measures that could be taken to ensure the price competitiveness of Malaysian CPO,” CIMB Research said.
To recap, in December 2018, Indonesia, the world’s top exporter of palm oil, revised its export levy for palm oil whereby it will no longer collect levies from palm exporters when prices are below the threshold of US$570 per tonne, but will charge US$10-$25 per tonne once prices are in a range of US$570-$619 per tonne. The levy will rise to US$20-$50 per tonne when prices hit above US$619 per tonne.
In March 2019, Indonesia announced that it will keep the palm oil export levy at zero from March to May 2019. It will revert to the existing export levy schedule for CPO on June 1, 2019.
Malaysia’s move is to support CPO prices, keep Malaysian palm oil competitive.
“ We view this move as supportive of CPO prices in view of Malaysia's high palm oil stock of 2.92m tonnes as at end-Mar 2019. The decision to suspend the CPO export tax will help keep Malaysian palm oil competitive to raise exports and lower stockpile ahead of the peak production season for palm oil in 2H19, to avoid a repeat of the sharp drop in CPO prices in 4Q18.
“However, this move is not likely to have any impact on CPO prices in the near term as Malaysia's CPO export tax has been stuck at zero level since September 2018, as monthly average CPO prices continue to stay below RM2,250 per tonne.
“The slower-than-expected drawdown in Malaysian palm inventory, coupled with projection of high global oilseeds production have depressed CPO prices recently. We keep our Neutral rating and average CPO price of RM2,400 per tonne, but could revisit our price outlook if stocks remain stubbornly high in 2Q19,” CIMB Research said.

In making the remark, French Ambassador to Malaysia, Frederic Laplanche, acknowledged that palm oil's long association with deforestation and destruction has damaged the image but things are changing.
“I can see the Malaysian government is tackling the environmental issue and the trust deficit among the European consumers positively. It focuses its efforts on these two objectives, which I think are really good and important.
“On the one hand, you got the mobilisation to promote the palm oil and improving its image which is lacking in the mind of the public opinion. So the government launched the promotion campaign, Love MY Palm Oil to help clear the crop's name,” he told Bernama.
“And secondly, the development of an ambitious policy to promote environmental protection, including maintaining over 50 per cent biodiverse tropical rainforest, to cap Malaysia's total area for oil palm at 6.5 million hectares (ha) (from 5.8 million ha in 2018) and no oil palm cultivation on peat soil, as well as improving sustainability is indeed crucial in order to regain the trust of the European consumers. And this is something that we can fully support,” said Laplanche.
NO BAN ON PALM OIL
Other developments that are encouraging are Sabah's move to fully embrace the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification and at the federal level, the drive for the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification initiative.
“Besides the Ministry of Primary Industries, the Ministry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment and Climate Change has also listed down strong policy on renewable energy and solar development.
“Additionally, the Ministry of Water, Land and Natural Resources develops policies to curb deforestation and to encourage reforestation in degraded areas. So all these put together makes strong and credible policies for the environment,” he explained.
Laplanche stressed that there is no ban on palm oil going into the EU, but what is happening is that France and the EU as a whole are gradually withdrawing the incentives for palm oil to be added into the diesel mix.
“The reason (for withdrawing the incentives) is because the calculation that was made showed that there is a problem of balance and carbon impact.
“Of course, I must be clear that although there is no ban, these measures will probably result in a reduction in the use of palm oil as a biofuel in Europe, depending on the prices of fossil fuel.
“Indeed, by withdrawing the fiscal incentives, the economic case for adding palm oil into diesel could disappear because palm oil is more expensive than traditional fossil fuel at current market prices.
“But it is important to understand that it is not a ban, and we are only talking about withdrawing an incentive, and only for palm oil as a biofuel. There is absolutely no change in policy regarding palm oil used for food products and basic material for the oleochemical industry at the French or the EU level”.
EU NOT AN ENEMY OF PALM OIL
He said that the EU was among the first to introduce the incentive for biofuel and it is among the last regions in the world to still give incentives for palm oil and biofuel.
“Most of the other countries have either never given the incentives for palm oil to enter their market as biofuel or had withdrawn them for a long time. So I would not like people to think that the EU is an enemy of palm oil, and of Malaysia. It's not the case.”
The EU, according to him, has consistently provided a big market for the Malaysian palm oil, and becoming the second largest customer for palm oil in the world, just behind India.
He also said that the EU is not going to change import tariff for palm oil and in fact, the tariffs for imported palm oil to EU is among the lowest in the world.
Paris recently published new statistics for France-Malaysia bilateral trade, which showed an increase of 11.4 per cent for Malaysian export to France last year across all products, reaching more than RM11 billion.
With a more modest 3.4 per cent growth in French exports to Malaysia, this country registered almost RM2 billion trade surplus with France, an increase of 73 per cent compared with 2017.
DEVELOP DIALOGUE BETWEEN MALAYSIA AND FRANCE
Meanwhile, Laplanche also said there is a need for a close dialogue between France and the Malaysian government.
“That is what we are doing at the moment. We develop a dialogue with the government and palm oil producers as much as we can.

PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla.: President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that China ""broke the deal"" in trade talks with Washington and would face stiff tariffs if no agreement is reached.
""You see the tariffs we're doing?"" Trump told a rally with supporters in Florida. ""Because they broke the deal. ... They broke the deal. So they're flying in. The vice premier tomorrow is flying in, but they broke the deal. They can't do that. So they'll be paying. If we don't make the deal, nothing wrong with taking in more than $100 billion a year.""
Trump has threatened to impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods beginning on Friday after China backtracked on substantial commitments it made during ongoing trade talks, top U.S. trade officials said this week. - Reuters

Negative as it may be, AllianceDBS said there would be no immediate impact towards demand as this is only expected to happen in 2030. The losses could also be alleviated by Malaysia’s B10 biodiesel mandate.
“We expect a rise in average CPO prices, based on the pick-up in demand due to dissipating effects of bumper crops from Indonesia in 2018 along with restocking activities from India and China as well as improved demand from Indonesia and Malaysia’s B20 and B10 mandates,” it said."

Benchmark palm oil contract for August delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange was last up 1.4% at RM2,073 (US$498.68) a tonne.
The market earlier rose to RM2,075, its strongest level since May 2. Palm is also up 4.5% so far for the week, in line to chart its first week of gains in four.
""The market is supported by the continuation of good exports,"" said a Kuala Lumpur-based trader, referring to the export data reported by cargo surveyors on Wednesday.
Malaysian palm oil shipments rose between 4% and 15% during May 1-15 from the corresponding period last month, according to data from three cargo surveyors, Amspec Agri Malaysia, Intertek Testing Services and Societe Generale de Surveillance.
Another trader added that palm prices were supported by continuous gains in competing vegetable oils.
The Chicago July soybean oil contract had gained 0.9% on Wednesday, after US President Donald Trump eased concerns over the US-China tariff war, and was last up 0.4% on Thursday.
Palm oil prices are affected by movements in soyoil, with which it competes for global market share.
Palm oil may rise to RM2,091 per tonne, as it has cleared a resistance at RM2,034, said Reuters market analyst for commodities and energy technicals Wang Tao.
Meanwhile, the May soyoil contract on the Dalian Commodity Exchange was up 0.6%, and the Dalian May palm oil contract jumped 2.6%.

The contract has more or less cleared a resistance at RM2,091, the 107% projection level of a downtrend from RM2,896. It may extend its gain to the next resistance at RM2,144. A falling channel indicates the same target as well.
A break above RM2,144 would be a milestone in chart development, as it will strongly suggest the formation of a big double-bottom around RM1,967. This pattern developed from the Nov 28, 2018 low of RM1,966. In the meantime, the break will open the way towards the range of RM2,246-2,321.
On the hourly chart, the contract has cleared a resistance at RM2,085, the 138.2% projection level on a downtrend from RM2,218. It is heading towards a range of RM2,122-2,145.

Its earning performance has been overall fluctuating in last five years, whereby its earning per share overall fluctuated from -2.3 sen to 27.7sen. The Group posted a loss before tax of RM51 million for the year 2018. This was primarily as a result of significantly lower palm product prices which impacted its bottom line. High start-up expenses for the acquisition of 11,579 hectares of land in Sabah and the rehabilitation and improvements for these estates also contributed to the deficit. The Group declared a dividend of 7 sen per share in the 2018 financial year, which amounts to a dividend yield of 9.72%.

Revenues increased by 20.5% from 134.91m to 162.7mil
Net Loss has decreased by 70% from 16.2mil to 9.55mil
Borrowings increased by 1.32% from 722.25mil to 731.8mil
Bank Balance Decreased by 53.3% from 46.02mil to 21.5mil
The Group’s operating result is influenced by both CPO prices and FFB crop production. The
cropping pattern for oil palms is influenced by weather conditions. FFB production normally starts
with a trough at the beginning of the year and thereafter increases gradually to reach a peak during
the second half of the year.
In March 2020, as part of the COVID-19 containment efforts, the Sabah State Government decided
to shutdown palm oil operations in six districts in Sabah from 25 March 2020 to 14 April 2020. The
estates and mills located in Semporna, Lahad Datu and Kinabatangan in Sabah and were operating in the affected areas are Segaria Estate, Segaria Palm Oil Mill, Sungai Segamaha Estate, Bukit
Segamaha Estate, G&G Estate, Ladang Tabung Tentera Sabah, Segamaha Palm Oil Mill, Boustead
Sungai Lokan Estate and Boustead Lokan Baru Estate. However, the shutdown has had no material
effect on the Group’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows for the quarter."

Q1 2020: Average CPO price 2.7k, still PBT
Q1 2019 Average CPO price 2k : LBT
Q4 2019 : Average CPO price 2.4k, LBT
Means bplant need to above 2.5k, to break even. The revenue in Bplant is simple: price (CPO price where you can monitor at MPOB) times quantity (depends on performance of the plant). If you see CPO price today, do you think Bplant can make money in quarter 2?
Maybe yes if they can increase the quantity. But presumably that plantation sector will have higher FFB in q3 and q4.

Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said the exemption on export duty was to boost the commodity sector.

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800003588.jsp?ftp=56","Jul 23, 2020 11:08 PM","johoran","吉隆坡23日讯）已接连蒙亏3个季度的宝实得种植（BPLANT，5254，主要板种植）正积极实施转型策略，以提高生产力和绩效，并乐观预计可在2021年中旬看见可观的成绩。
宝实得种植从2019财年第3季开始蒙亏至今，但2020财年首季净亏已逐渐收窄。该公司总执行长依布拉欣阿都马吉接受《中国报》电邮访问时说，公司业绩优劣取决于多种因素，且大多不在管理层的控制范围之内。
“我们惟有通过转型计划来解决自身的不足之处，从而改善业绩表现。”
阿都马吉指出，转型计划的重点在于提高每公顷种植地的产量、达至生产成本最小化、提高工厂利用率，并简化种植园管理程序，首阶段计划将持续12到18个月。
提高生产力和绩效
“我们希望借此长远的提高公司生产力和绩效，并预计在2021年中旬看到可观的结果。”
一旦在营运和财务表现上站稳了脚跟，并拥有额外的现金流，宝实得种植将展开转型计划的第2阶段（持续到2024年），著重于通过加强公司的自由现金流和降低负债比率来为股东创造价值。
为了改善营运绩效并提高获利，宝实得种植将更审慎管理营运成本，包括改进作业模式、持续推动机械化营运流程等。
“我们将对表现欠佳的资产进行合理化调整、进行种植土地再平衡，以在目前的土地储备中找出无法种植和再收割的区域。未来，我们也将继续审查和监控表现不佳的庄园和工厂，以管理资本开销并节省现金流。”
主要市场需求增加 棕油业开始复苏
随著全球防疫封锁措施逐渐解除，加上库存减少和中国与印度在内主要消费市场的需求增加提振，宝实得种植预计，棕油行业将从下半年起复苏，全年原棕油平均价格将介于2400令吉至2500令吉之间。
尽管种植领域在短期内仍受疫情影响，但阿都马吉指出，鉴于行业性质，放眼长期前景才是最重要的。
同时，为推动推动原产业发展，我国政府将在7月1日至12月31日期间，完全豁免原棕油、天然棕油和棕仁油的出口税，相信可助激励原棕油价格回升。
“马来西亚棕榈油委员会（MPOC）也预测，原棕油价格将在2020年下半年达到每公吨2594令吉的高水平，相信这也将改善我们的业绩表现。”
不过，市场需求仍是决定原棕油价格这两年走势的关键因素，而疫情预计造成发展中国家食品相关的可支配性收入减少，进而抑制油脂消费的上升趋势。
“但相信需求下降的情况可在明年恢复正常。无论如何，所有预测都以疫情受到控制为前提，否则所有商品所承受的新一轮下行压力都是可预见的。”
劳动力短缺
多个领域的企业在行动管制令期间被迫停工，尽管种植业是必要行业，但阿都马吉称，公司旗下9个种植地和工厂都受到了影响。
“沙巴州政府从3月25日至4月14日对6个地区的棕油种植园施加停工令，我们在当地的4家工厂在下午5点后不得营运，影响了原棕油的生产工作。”
虽然沙巴州行动管制令在5月份结束，但宝实得种植在聘用外劳来管理种植园、处理肥料进口，以及油棕树鲜果串（FFB）和原棕油运输方面仍受影响。
“劳动力短缺在一定程度上影响了收割作业，导致施肥和其他保养工作的延迟。但我们已通过优先安排油棕树鲜果串的收割来解决问题，也正培训一批工人进行收割工作。”

Singapore-based Palm Oil Analytics owner and co-founder Dr Sathia Varqa said, nevertheless, CPO futures were expected to still have stamina to climb higher next week.
""The most active month (July) is likely to test RM2,800 per tonne before scaling back. The sharp rise in the futures and cash market has made palm less competitive to its nearest rival, soybean oil,” he told Bernama.
The palm oil prices must fall to reclaim the US$70 discount to soybean oil or the latter's prices must rise at a faster pace to palm, he said.
Sathia said CPO price movements have been, and will, likely continue to be influenced by the general trend in major commodities particularly crude oil and soybean oil.
For the week just ended, the CPO futures contract traded firmer for a third consecutive day, tracking the surge in rival oils.
On Friday’s closing, August 2020 rose RM285 to RM2,890 per tonne -- the highest since Feb 5.
Meanwhile, BMD continued its growth path in trading activity for two days when the total daily trading volume for CPO futures contract (FCPO) touched a new record exceeding 70,000 lots, compared with the average total trading volume for FCPO of 50,000 lots.
On a Friday-to-Friday basis, the CPO futures contract for August 2020 rose RM285 to RM2,890 per tonne, September 2020 surged RM300 to RM2,854 per tonne, October 2020 added RM258 to RM2,778 per tonne, and November 2020 jumped RM213 to RM2,713 per tonne.
Weekly volume increased to 311,950 lots from last Friday’s 278,651 lots while open interest widened to 259,670 contracts from 246,199 contracts.
On the physical market, August South advanced RM180 to RM2,880 per tonne. - Bernama"

1. China North East got great flood wiping off its bread basket of corn and soybean
2. Last year China culled pigs due to disease
Pigs need lots of soymeal feed
3. So China will buy more soybean from Usa
4. Usa also got drought so less soybean
5. Prices of soybean surged
Very good for palm oil as India connot expensive soybean oil turn to Malaysia palm oil
6. Plus more people stay home eat more biscuit
Biscuit got high palm oil content as well as Malaysian milo and kit kat...full of palm oil
Ofi, hup Seng, Apollo and hwatai showed increasing revenue from biscuit sale due to mco lock down
Many getting fat on palm oil from KitKat, milo and snacks of biscuit, cakes, ice cream all got high palm oil content
All these will cause heavy sale of palm oil
Palm oil stocks will then go into multi year bull run"

2. As a result China must buy soybean from Usa.
3. Last year China swine fever wiped off many pigs. Soybean is also needed as feedmeal for pigs
3. Us now in drought as soybean production is less.
4. Argentina and Brazil soybean crops won""t be ready until Feb 2021
5. So with increasing demand and dwindling supply soybean prices are rocketing upward
6. Soybean going up will pull up palm oil as their prices are co-related
7. India now will turn to cheaper palm oil as soyoil becomes too expensive
8. Malaysian palm oil stocks are depleting due to lack of Indonesia workers due to mco
Again less stock means higher prices
9. Last quarter result of March to May cpo prices were weak. Buy cpo prices have surged from June to August quarters so palm oil stocks are expected to report very good results in Nov 2020
10. Best of the best now in Sept 2020 soybean oil has almost reached Usd35.00 and Cpo future going to cross Rm3,000 barrier
All these converging factors will propel palm oil stocks into bull run just like coronavirus powered up medical gloves
Buy early before others are aware

Because if soybean price is up it will be more expensive for soy oil
And India cannot afford to buy expensive soybean oil will then buy the cheaper palm oil
And if demand for palm oil goes up so will be its selling prices
That is why China after 5 typhoon got to buy up all corn and soybean from world markets in panic
This will last for at least 6 months till next soybean harvests from Argentina and Brazil in the southern hemisphere while the North is going into winter months
And then palm oil will reign as king as there is no competing vege oil around
Palm oil stocks will go into a 6 months Bull run from now
It might turn into a Superbull if Both Argentina and Brazil soyoil crops fail due to drought
So just buy and hold all palm oil stocks for at least 3 to 6 months
This is a sure fire winner for holding precious palm oil shares now."

鉅亨網
鉅亨網編譯許家華
鉅亨網2020年9月19日
隨著反聖嬰現象 (LaNiña) 造成全球氣候異常，全球大豆供應將更加緊繃。
反聖嬰現象是太平洋中東部海水異常變冷的情況，可能影響全球天氣以及各地的農作物。
近期因中國需求增加，大豆價格已大幅上漲至 2 年高點，如今可能因天氣影響而使產量下降再進一步推高價格。
芝加哥商品交易所 11 月黃豆期貨週四收高 17-1/4 美分，每蒲式耳 10.28-1/2 美元，此前觸及 10.32-1/4 美元，為自 2018 年 5 月以來最高價格。
今年迄今大豆價格已上漲近 8%，且自 3 月低點大漲了 25%，與大盤走勢背道而馳。彭博大宗商品指數 (BCOM-US) 今年迄今下跌近 11%，而彭博大豆分指數今年迄今上漲近 4％。
發行 ETF 的 GraniteShares 投資組合經理 Jeff Klearman 表示，在今年反彈之前，大豆處境艱困，面臨包括「中國新冠病毒和非洲豬瘟挫傷需求、全球預計供應過剩、以及美元強勢」等不利因素。
Klearman 指出，全球各地的肉類加工廠被迫關閉以防止新冠病毒傳播，進而降低了牲畜與豬肉的需求，因此用來作為動物飼料的大豆需求也隨之下降。
Klearman 表示，今年美元走疲、美國中西部的天氣乾旱、中國需求強勁、肉品加工廠復工，以及中國的豬瘟威脅「減輕」，這些全部有助於推動大豆價格上漲。
Teucrium 交易公司總裁 Sal Gilbertie 指出，中國一直是大豆的主力買家，甚至在一定程度上可以用來避免中美貿易摩擦加劇。截至 8 月底的 2019-2020 農事年，中國大豆進口量創下 9800 萬公噸紀錄，預計 2020-2021 農事年也會再次刷新紀錄，一些人甚至估計會超過 1 億公噸。
Gilbertie 指出，中國農作物產量遭天氣影響而下降，且中國「積極地」重建豬群數量，因此中國夏季對農產品的需求「異常大量」，倘若中國生產問題比預期更嚴重，全球大豆供需狀況將更加緊繃。同時，中國習慣在價格低檔時買進作為策略庫存。
Gilbertie 預期，2020-2021 期末全球大豆庫存，或滿足需求後剩餘的供應量應為 9359 萬噸，較上一期下降 17%，「對這樣重要的大宗商品而言，這個下降比例相當巨大。」
國家海洋和大氣管理局本月 10 日表示，反聖嬰現象的氣候模式已經形成，預計整個冬天都會持續此氣候，這進一步加劇市場對供應緊張的擔憂，因為大豆生產中斷的可能性上升。
Gilbertie 指出，大豆供應量緊張已經讓價格上升至「貿易戰前多年的交易範圍，每蒲式耳 9 至 12 美元之間。」
Daniels Trading 高階商品經紀人 Craig Turner 估計，若發生極端的反聖嬰現象，大豆價格可能飆升至每蒲式耳 13 美元或以上。大豆期貨價格自 2014 年以降尚未見如此高價水準。
「如果南美因為反聖嬰現象有實質嚴重的生產問題，那麼全球大豆市場恐被迫進行劇烈的價格配給。」"

To recap, recent surge in FCPO was mainly driven by a confluence of positives such as playing catch-up with a rally in soybean prices due to robust demand from China (as major crops were destroyed by typhoons), renewed buying interests from India, a weak USD, expectations of the development of a La Niña climate pattern potentially leading to lower production etc.
Based on the monthly chart, FCPO could break the formidable LT neckline resistance near RM3200, supported by the bullsih indicators. A decisive breakout above this hurdle could spur prices higher at RM3400-3600 zones. Key supports are situated at RM2700-2900 levels.""

Amost every one was enjoying increasing profits. Many have resigned from their jobs to do full time trading in the stock market. Stock market tips and conversations were the order of the day. Everywhere in offices, homes, coffee shops, markets, eating places people talked only about the next “Limit Up” stocks.
In every trading Hall or Room there is no available seats. In RHB Bank HQ there isn’t even standing room. Cramped, jammed and packed with traders and specualtors from all walks of life. It Was The GoGo Years Before The Asian Financial Crisis!
One man stood out. Peter Lim of Singapore. He sold all his shares near the very peak and bought into just one counter – WILMAR the Plantation Stock.
On hindsight it was an uncanny but very accurate move. Next year in July 2nd 1997 George Soros attacked the Thai bath. The Thai bath collapsed and then contagion spread to Malaysia, Singapore, Hk, Korea, Indonesia – One by One Their Stock Markets Collapsed like tent pins.
At the height KLSE was 1332 and at the bottom it was only 262 points – A Crash of 81%
Nobody fully invested could have escaped such a carnage. It was a disaster for many. Tens of thousands went bankrupt. Many Banks & Financial Institutions were insolvent. Before the Asian Financial Crisis there were 49 Banks and Credit Companies in Malaysia. With the devastating carnage less than 10 Banks now standing. The rest became history.
Tycoon Peter Lim invested $10 millions into Wilmar – the plantation stock owned by Robert Kuok.
How come Peter was so “chun chun”? All $10 millions into one single stock. And he was right on target. Four years later in 2,000 Peter Lim “THE REMISIER KING” of Singapore sold his Wilmar shares for a cool $1.5 Billions!
So plantation stock investment if timed well can make you a billionaire!
As for Robert Kuok he became the Richest Man No. One in All of Malaysia with over Rm40 Billions.
Ha! Are we now entering another phase of market doom? Maybe yes or maybe no.
But This Is For Sure:
A POWERFUL EL NINO IS NOW ONGOING
Hmmm?
Let’s SEE if Plantation Stocks will create more millionaires and billionaires this round."

在每个交易大厅或房间中都没有空的座位。在RHB银行总部甚至人潮多的连站的地方都没有。这些地方都挤满了各行各业的商人和专业人士。这些情景发生在亚洲金融危机爆发前！
在这个时期，却有一个人脱颖而出。他就是新加坡的Peter Lim。他在接近股市高峰期时，卖掉了所有股票。然后，只买了一档股票– WILMAR种植园股票。
事后看来，这是一个奇怪但非常精准的举动。在1997年7月2日，乔治·索罗斯（George Soros）袭击了泰珠。泰珠崩溃后，骨牌效益蔓延到了其它国家，例如马来西亚，新加坡，香港，韩国，印度尼西亚。
当时的KLSE最高时为1332点，最低仅剩下262点–暴跌了将近81％。
对于许多人来说，这是一场灾难。数以万计的人破产。许多银行和金融机构资不抵债。亚洲金融危机之前，马来西亚有大概49家银行和信贷公司。如今，剩下的也大概10家。其余的已成为历史。
Peter Lim当时投资了10 million在Wilmar。Wilmar是Mr. Robert Kuok持有的种植园股票。
为何Peter Lim会如此的精准投资？把所有的资金投资在一档股票里面。而且他是正中目标。四年后，新加坡的Peter Lim“ THE REMISIER KING”以15亿的高价出售了其Wilmar股份！
因此，如果时机合适的，种植园股票投资是可以使您成为富翁！
我们现阶段是否正在进入市场厄运的另一阶段吗？让我们拭目以待。
但肯定的是：
EL NINO现象正在酝酿当中
让我们期待种植园股票是否将在这一轮创造更多的百万富翁和亿万富翁。"

(i) weather anomalies resulting in poorer-than-expected output growth -*Let's hope for a good weather the next coming 3 months*.
(ii) lower than-expected CPO price achieved – *On Target and currently CPO is Up trending*
(iii) negative policies imposed by import countries – *Positive*. The exemption of CPO export duty by the government of Malaysia till Dec 2020 will be positive for CPO exports (especially to India) and will help support CPO price which is expected to be under pressure in 3Q20 due to the anticipated stockpile build-up amid seasonal production recovery
(iv) unfriendly policies imposed by the Malaysian and Indonesian government on upstream or downstream segments – *Already factored on India’s move to restrict the importation of refined palm oil*. This will result in quicker build-up of MPOB stockpile when output recovers from 2Q20, and cap CPO price upside
(v) sharply lower crude oil prices which makes palm biodiesel demand not viable – *Brent has already breached USD 40*
(vi) weaker competing oil prices (like soybean and rapeseed- *On Target*. Alternative Oil Prices is on the rise which make Palm Oil very attractive.

Date: 9th October 2020
Solvent Extractors Association of India organised a webinar yesterday titled “World Price Outlook for Vegetable Oils and Meals”. There were three speakers i.e. Thomas Mielke from Oil World, Dorab Mistry from Godrej International and James Fry from LMC International. Here are the key takeaways from the webinar: -
James Fry said that rains and good palm prices would encourage better estate maintenance in Malaysia and Indonesia, leading to improved palm production in year 2021F. Rains would boost CPO supply in early-2021F and in the meantime, there would be a seasonal pick-up in production in 4Q2020. Peak palm production may be delayed by a month or two from the usual month of October or November in Malaysia.
In terms of demand, many companies in the HORECA sector (hotels, restaurants and catering) may not survive without government support. Families in low income countries may be trading down to smaller bottles of cooking oil. James Fry did not give a price forecast.
Thomas Mielke said that CPO prices may hover around US$700/tonne (RM2,905/tonne) in 1H2021. He forecasts global production of palm oil to increase by 3.5mil to 4mil tonnes in 2021F. CPO output in Indonesia is estimated to rise by 3mil tonnes in 2021F from about 43mil tonnes in 2020E. Thomas Mielke expects CPO production in Malaysia to be flat in 2021F.
He added that global soybean supply is ample currently in spite of weather-related losses in the US. He expects world soybean supply to increase by 21mil tonnes in 2020E/2021F as Brazil is envisaged to record a record output of 132.5mil tonnes (2019/2020E: 126.5mil tonnes).
Dorab Mistry believes that CPO production in Malaysia would be flat at 19.9mil tonnes in 2020E compared with market expectations of a decline. We believe that this implies that 4Q2020 production would be strong as Malaysia’s CPO output fell by 4.7% YoY in 8M2020. He did not give a production forecast for 2021F although he said that palm supply would be good.
Dorab has suggested a dynamic biodiesel mandate to the Indonesia government whereby if CPO prices exceed US$600/tonne, the biodiesel mandate would be reduced to B25 from B30. If CPO prices exceed US$700/tonne, the biodiesel mandate would be reduced further to B20. With this, the biodiesel mandate would still be implemented but at the same time, the smallholders would not be affected by the CPO export levy. Currently, Indonesia implements the B30 biodiesel mandate with subsidies from the CPO export levy of US$55/tonne.

My humble opinion based on limited no. of years in the market is that the company asset has nothing to do with you until they sell it and you get part from it.

1. Land might be slightly above fair value, but it is LAND, better than cash, so when they leveraged got funds and buy land, I think overall good decision, and please pray tell which currency in the world is worth having, all are FIAT money…
2. What are the chances of BPLANT defaulting?
- As long as CPO is above RM2.2k they are able to maintain production of 60k MT of CPO per quarter, they can cover the interest
- Indonesia & Malaysia don’t have lots of new land for growing palm oil, population is growing, food demand will also grow, thus CPO in long term will be on uptrend
- They have more than 224 hectares of ripe land for development, which eventually can be used to pare down the debts, or hopefully can look to buy more land!!
Buying land is a long term play, and it is not easy to buy land now, I think the rich know, money is getting smaller now, so ppl put a very high price on their land/asset, and even got buyer they still not willing to sell. To me investing in BPLANT is investing in Land, and Land that will continue to bring returns…"

Adding up the high spike of CPO prices now and demand, BPLANT will be earning in the next 2 quarters.

Analysts neutral on plantation sector after jump in palm oil supply
TheEdge Fri, Sep 11, 2020 10:42am - 1 week ago
KUALA LUMPUR (Sept 11): Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB) Research has reiterated its ""neutral"" rating of the plantation sector after palm oil inventory closed marginally higher at 1.7 million tonnes in August as higher output and lower exports were partly offset by lower imports and higher domestic consumption.
On forecasts, HLIB Research analyst Chye Wen Fei said the research house believes the stockpile will remain on an uptrend in the near term due to seasonally stronger output and lower exports to key importing countries, in particular India as its edible oil inventory had normalised since July and China in absence of seasonal demand.
Meanwhile, PublicInvest Research noted that CPO prices had gone above the RM2,800/metric tonnes (MT) level since last week, led by increasing concerns over worker shortages and demand recovery from the reopening of economies.
Nevertheless, the research house thinks the current CPO prices may not be sustainable in the final quarter given the surge in palm oil supply during the peak production season.
Why you posted the same old article again and again ? Today oil palm price rm 3400 and share price already 52.5 cents,a lot people made money but you talk bad about the company future financial status everyday , the share price at 48 cents you started to talk bad and now 52.5 cents you still talk bad, what is your intention to be here ?"

Prevailing CPO Price as of yesterday is RM 3354. Cost of producing is between RM 1500-1800. This will be good for our farmers. So we expect more movements in this counter due to feel good effect on the latest Indian FGV Oil Palm Contract, Bullish FCPO (Jan FCOP has already breaches RM 3,144), current CPO prices plus the feel good effect of 2021 Budget which will be tabled tomorrow.

KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 24 2018): Boustead Plantations Bhd (BPB) plans to sell plantation land to pay off debts and tax.
The plantation group announced this evening that it intends to dispose of three parcels of freehold plantation lands measuring 138.89 hectares on mainland Penang for RM136.04 million to repay RM127.5 million bank borrowings, and RM6.8 million real property gains tax.
BPB has entered into two sale and purchase agreements with Sunrich Conquest Sdn Bhd and Titanium Greenview Sdn Bhd for the sale of 82.84 hectares, and 56.05ha of land, for RM81.14 million and RM54.9 million, respectively, according to the filing with Bursa Malaysia.
The sale by BPB was represented by CIMB Islamic Trustee Bhd, which also holds all plantation assets of Al-Hadharah Boustead REIT.
The sale consideration represents a premium of RM5 million or 4% over the fair market value of the lands of RM131 million accorded by the valuer Jones Lang Wootton.
BPB said in the announcement to the stock exchange that the lands form part of the 677.78ha Malakoff Estate in Tasek Gelugor, and it will continue to own and operate its plantation business on the remaining 562.33ha of the estate.
BPB said the lands’ strategic location provide an opportunity to realise the capital appreciation of the lands by disposing them at a substantial premium over the net book value of the lands.
In a separate statement BPB vice chairman Tan Sri Lodin Wok Kamaruddin said the proposed sale was an ideal opportunity for the group to enhance value for shareholders.
BPB will realise an estimated gain of about RM115.9 million upon completion of the proposed sale, representing an upfront gain of about RM834,000 per ha that would raise its shareholders value by about seven sen per BPB share, said Lodin.
By using the realised funds for repayment of bank borrowings, it will be able to carry out strategic expansion in new plantation land banks, hence growing BPB’s plantation revenue and profit in the future.
The proposed sale is subject to conditions precedent, amongst them obtaining the necessary approvals from the Estate Land Board and the Economic Planning Unit.
The proposed sale is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2018.
At closing, BPB share price rose four sen or 1.43% to RM2.83 for a market capitalisation of RM2.65 billion."

Soy bean crops can't produce in 2021 in Argentina and Brazil (world largest producer) as they already missed the production window for the year due to the lanina effect. Its not simply any time they can plant and harvest soybean there. It must be planted at year end in order to reap the harvest in the following year.
Agriculture need to follow the crop cycle....
There will be shortage on soy oil supply, and palm being its substitute will experienced increased demand. Both soy and palm oil will go up in price together."

A Genuine Bull Run Comes like Incoming Waves on the Sea Shore
IT COMES IN 3 STEPS. THEN PULLS BACK 2 STEPS
AND IT RETURNS AGAIN IN 3 WAVES THEN WITHDRAWS IN 2 WAVES
THESE WAVES PATTERNS ARE LIKEN TO A GENUINE BULL RUN (AS OPPOSED TO QUICK PUMP & DUMP STOCKS WHICH ARE JUST FLASH IN THE PAN: IT FLASHES UP!. DRAWS IN SORCHAI. BURNT THEM KAW KAW. THEN GAME OVER)

Malaysia engaged University of Malaya and two universities in US to carry out research to defend the sabotage. The results shows CPO do content cholesterol but is more good HDL cholesterol than bad LDL which will reduce cholesterol in the long run. on the other hand, Most other cool weather vegetables oil have to add in hydrogen or hydrogenated so that can store longer and with stand high heat. The hydrogenated process makes the oil become edible oil with Transf fat. So, CPO always the cheapest edible oil in the market."

The main usage for Soy Bean are as food for Pigs and the oil for cooking. It is therefore more economical compare to Oil Palm as it has dual purpose. So, market willing to pay higher price for Soy Bean compare to Soy Bean.
SOB 4th Dec is USD0.3841 per pound or RM0.3841x4 x 2.2x1000 = RM 3380 per MT. Which is lower than RM3502 for CPO on 3rd Dec. SBO has been traditionally USD50-80 higher price than CPO. But Since Nov 2020, CPO price overtook SBO by USD15/MT and now is higher by USD30. This happens could be few reasons, 1) Africa Swine Flu have killed many pigs. The main food for pigs are Soy Bean. When number of pigs are low, the demand for Soy Bean also lower. Cause is not economical if just buy to press oil. 2) Market shortage of Soy Bean due to dry weather and Soy Bean Oil from the bean are very much lower % compare to Oil Palm, so, it will not be economical if purely press the Soy Bean just for the Oil but not to feed the pigs. So, the SBO become shortage. 3) The main exporter for Soy Bean is shortage of Soy Bean and have to import Soy Bean this year. When SBO shortage, price for SBO increase, CPO price also increase. 4) End November 2020 India reduces Taxes for CPO to 27.5% from 37.5%. This has increase the demand for CPO.

After Pandemic, very likely PAT will be lower than Pre Covid level cause demand for glove will slow down, over stocking and too many production lines. But, let assume Top Glove can still play the magic and can make 227% times higher that pre covid level. Then quarterly profit Post cover will be 2.27x110m = 250m. 1 year will be RM 1bn. Sounds a lot?
When Profit grow is slowly down, Valuation also drop and PE of 20 is consider highly expensive. Let's assume Top Glove still can get PE 20. Then, market capitalisation will RM 1bn x 20 = RM20 bn. At current Top Glove price at RM6.90. The market capitalisation is RM56.5bn. That means , the potential drop is RM36.5bn or drop 64.6%.

calvintaneng For Thplant It is the most efficient Palm oil producer
Among the lowest cost & therefore Thplant among the very first to show two quarter profits
.92 sen
Then a jump to 1.78 sen
And that profit was based on CPO at Rm2,477
NOW FCPO Jan 2021 ALREADY RM3,608
See https://www.bursamalaysia.com/market_information/derivatives_prices
So Rm3,608 - Rm2,477 = Rm1,131 EXTRA PROFIT UPON PROFIT NOW OR UP ANOTHER 45.6%
So less 10% to 15% production is very minimal
FEB 2021 RESULT FOR TH PLANT WILL BLOW MICKEY MOUSE TO OUTER SPACE!!

YEAR 2021 WILL BE PALM OIL ""BULL RUN""
WHY PALM OIL WILL GO INTO A BULL RUN FOR YEAR 2021?
ANSWER:
BECAUSE CPO PRICES NOW REACHING ALL TIME HIGH WILL AMPLIFY PROFITS
AND IF PROFITS KEEP INCREASING IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME COMPANIES WILL INCREASE DIVIDENDS OR REWARD WITH BONUS ISSUES. SO PALM OIL SHARES MUST GO UP AS THIS IS THE LAW!
SOYBEAN OIL GETTING MORE EXPENSIVE PEOPLE WILL GO FOR PALM OIL!! & PALM OIL WILL RISE IN TANDEM
AGAIN WHEN ALL THE WORLD MARKETS CLOSED FOR CHRISTMAS FRIDAY - CHINA BEING COMMUNIST STILL TRADE IN DALIAN ALREADY RECORD HIGH FOR BOTH PALMOIL & SOYABEAN MAH...!!
U r actually seeing emerging sign of palmoil share run like the early Gloves run in March to April Rally coming which are very subtle upside b4 it explosively burst out with gains of few hundred % coming at the later stage mah...!!
U need to join the palmoil stock early as this is a safest fruit pickings when there are still abundance in supply loh...!!

BPLANT | BOUSTEAD PLANTATIONS BHD
BPLANT ( Stock Code : 5254, BOUSTEAD
PLANTATIONS BERHAD, Main Market, PLANTATION)
WHY BPLANT AS MY PREFERRED CPO COUNTER FOR 2021?
1. LAST CLOSING 0.615 ,CONSIDERED ATTRACTIVE AND LOW
ENTRY PRICE ON EXPECTATION OF FURTHER RALLY IN CPO 2021
2. NOW TRADING AT 0.615; A 46.52% DISCOUNT TO NTA OF 1.15
3. DIVIDEND PAYING : DIVIDEND YIELD 0.81
4. 3QFY20 net profit stood at RM18.0m vs. a net loss of RM34.3m recorded in the previous corresponding quarter, underpinned by the rebound in crude palm oil prices. Revenue for the quarter rose 47.7% YoY to RM205.7m. An interim dividend of 0.5 sen, payable on 30th December 2020 was declared. (The Star)
5. I will strike early before the price moves up
CPO on track to post the highest year-end closing in 25 years
Arjuna Chandran Shankar
KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 25): Crude palm oil (CPO) prices have been on a steady climb since early May, and the edible oil is poised to post the highest year-end closing in 25 years, if not longer.
According to Bloomberg, generic three-month palm oil futures (expiring on Dec 31) are currently trading RM48 higher at RM3,854 a tonne, a 25-year high."

Bplant NTA is actually below its real value, a lot of its land are not revaluate to reflect the current price.

If u check the cpo spot & future from Jan 2021 to Dec 2021 all prices are above Rm 3000 until November 2021 & only December 2021 is slightly below Rm 3000 but still consider high at around Rm 2970 per tonnes.
For your info, when palmoil is average rm 2500, all the palmoil plantations make good profit mah...!!
Thus the good profit of palmoil company is sustainable very good & the average palmoil price should easily exceed average rm 3000 for 2021 mah...!!

South America Weather Radar shows Argentina very dry
Soybean and Corn will be fair in Brazil but quite bad in Argentina
that means that Soyoil will be sustained
Thus palm oil should be well supported above Rm3000
Production is as low as Rm1465 by Thplant
and No tax of 8% if cpo prices falls below Rm3450
So most Palm oil companies will enjoy 100% net profit for 2021
Glove ASP now at its apex and will plateaued off and also Glove prices up alot from it's lows
Tech stocks surged very very high but got only average earnings
So P/E now very high
Only palm oil stocks got real and solid earnings for 2021 and prices still low
So go for palm oil shares while others chase bubbles"

Last year,a particular counter name SOLUTN with NTA 12 cents shot up the share price from 18cts to 2.00 ringgit with only showing a piece paper written with the word MOU from a major vaccine producer from China and until today we haven't seen vaccine at all, since no products available therefore no revenue received to increase the business profit which in turn to improve the P.E ratio but playing syndicate ignored that and played up the price to 2.00 ringgit level.,At this moment, the company still haven't received license from KKB to operate health care business whereas share price stay at 1.25 ringgit .For the past one year this company's traded share price is base on non existing forecasted profit and the funny part is that the high level share price sustained for more than one year without any real supported business profit ?

KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 29): Malaysia's trade surplus widened by 26.9% to RM184.8 billion in 2020, the largest trade surplus ever recorded thus far, while total trade amounted to RM1.8 trillion, down 3.6% year-on-year (y-o-y), said the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM).
Chief statistician Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Uzir Mahidin said in tandem with softer global demand and unfavourable external economic conditions due to the Covid-19 pandemic, total exports in 2020 contracted by 1.4% to RM981 billion from the preceding year, while imports declined by 6.3% or RM53.2 billion to RM796.2 billion.
He said December 2020 recorded the highest monthly export value of RM95.7 billion, up by 10.8% from the same month in 2019, outpacing import growth for eight consecutive months.
Mohd Uzir said after nine consecutive months of decline, imports rebounded to post growth of 1.6% to RM75 billion.
""Malaysia's exports continued their positive momentum in December 2020. The expansion in exports was supported by both re-exports and domestic exports.
""Re-exports stood at RM17.6 billion, up 22.9%, and contributed to 18.4% of the total exports, while domestic exports were valued at RM78.1 billion, recording growth of 8.3% y-o-y,"" he said in a statement today.
The trade surplus soared by 64.9% to RM20.7 billion y-o-y, he noted.
Mohd Uzir said Malaysia's export expansion was supported mainly by higher exports to Singapore (+RM2.2 billion), China (+RM1.9 billion), the United States (+RM1.7 billion), India (+RM1.62 billion), Hong Kong (+RM1.6 billion), and the European Union (+RM988.1 million).
The main products which contributed to the increase in exports were electrical and electronics products (+RM5.6 billion), rubber products (+RM3 billion), and palm oil and palm oil-based agriculture products (+RM2.6 billion)."

1 In order to fix the privatization price at 80 cts ,the Investment Bank has to set a fix price for the assets base on market value and normally the fix price is been suppressed in favour of the offerer.
2. ,Bplant is the one of the unit asset ,so, the offerer ensure Bplant share price will not trade above the setting price otherwise share holder of Boustead Holding will ask for price higher than 80 cts since the asset value gone higher.
3. If the privatization program turn down, Bplant share price will free out from the set limit price by Investment Bank.
4.The CPO AVP higher than 3000 rm for quite sometimes, surely the profit will be higher than last year.
5.With all the good sentiments credit, the share price should fly trade above 68.5cts in the near future !

Thru this strategy, they hope more minority shareholders will throw in when the offer come. The whole exercise is done so unprofessionally. We the minority must remember not to give in easily .
Also, relocating Amrin , ex MD of Boustead to be CEO LTAT speak volumes. Amrin shall know how to extract maximum value from the eventual privatized bstead for LTAT.

Mohd Khairuddin said Malaysia would continue to work with Indonesia to oppose discrimination on palm oil either in a two-way or multi-party relationship.
He said Indonesia and Malaysia, which are the largest and second-largest palm oil producer countries in the world respectively, were also constantly seeking to reach an agreement in developing and maintaining the palm oil industry in both countries.
Mohd Khairuddin said the Ministry of Plantation Industries and Commodities welcomed the call by the prime minister during a meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) in Jakarta yesterday to further strengthen Malaysia's cooperation with Indonesia to oppose discrimination on palm oil by European Union (EU) countries and several other countries.
He said the two leaders had expressed concern over the unfounded anti-palm oil campaign which did not reflect the sustainability of the palm oil industry and its preservation of environment. The campaign also contradicts the principles of free trade practices as outlined by the World Trade Organization (WTO).
Following that, Muhyiddin said Malaysia had filed for legal action against the EU with the WTO on Jan 15, in line with the statement issued on the same day as soon as the filing was done, apart from a similar action taken by Indonesia on the EU in December 2019."

KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 17): Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd (KLK) posted a net profit of RM357.41 million in its first quarter ended Dec 31, 2020 (1QFY21), more than double the RM167.2 million it recorded in the previous year’s corresponding quarter, driven by a jump in plantation earnings.
Revenue rose 5.45% to RM4.3 billion from RM4.08 billion, supported by growth in revenue across its manufacturing, plantation and property development segments.
Earnings per share (EPS) rose to 33.1 sen from 15.7 sen, its stock exchange filing today showed. No dividend payment was proposed.
The group said its plantation segment's profit surged 83.3% to RM288.9 million during the quarter, driven by improved crude palm oil and palm kernel prices, and better contribution from its processing and trading operations.
Its manufacturing segment's profit also grew 67.2% to RM133.7 million, largely contributed by its operations in China and Europe, coupled with an unrealised gain from fair value changes on outstanding derivatives contract of RM14.5 million.
Meanwhile, profit recognition from projects with better margins helped boost the group's property development segment by 62.2% to RM22 million.
Moving forward, the group expects its plantation profit to continue to improve in FY21, driven by buoyant CPO and PK prices, while its oleochemical division's performance — which has been satisfactory — is expected to be challenging.
“Overall, the group's profit for the financial year 2021 will be higher,” it said in a statement.
Shares of KLK closed 16 sen or 0.70% lower at RM22.76 today, valuing the plantation company at RM24.6 billion."

KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 18): Sime Darby Plantation Bhd swung back into the black for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2020 (4QFY20), posting a net profit of RM149 million, from a net loss of RM58 million in the corresponding quarter last year.
It also ended FY20 in the black, registering a full-year net profit of RM1.19 billion, from a net loss of RM200 million a year prior. Full-year revenue was up 8% at RM13.08 billion, from RM12.06 billion in FY19.
In a bourse filing, the planter said the higher net profit in 4QFY20 was on account of higher crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel (PK) prices, as well as higher fresh fruit bunch (FFB) output. Furthermore, its downstream unit saw better earnings following better performances from its Asia-Pacific and European operations.
The planter declared final single-tier dividend of 5.42 sen per share for FY20, bringing the total dividend for the year to 9.44 sen. In FY19, the planter declared a one sen dividend.
Earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter stood at 2.2 sen, from a loss per share (LPS) 0.9 sen in 4QFY19. For FY20, EPS stood at 17.2 sen, from a LPS of 2.9 sen in FY19.
Quarterly revenue increased by 8% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM3.64 billion from RM3.38 billion.
FFB production increased 2% y-o-y to 2.3 million tonnes in 4QFY20 from 2.26 million tonnes. The average CPO price for the quarter was up 19% to RM2,664 per metric tonne, from RM2,239 per metric tonne a year prior. PK prices were up 42% y-o-y at RM1,673 a tonne from RM1,176 a tonne. That being said, its CPO oil extraction rate was down at 21.35%, from 21.84% in 4QFY19.
Breaking down its results, the group noted that its upstream segment saw a profit before interest and tax (PBIT) of RM351 million from a loss before interest and tax (LBIT) of RM10 million in 4QFY19 following higher commodity prices and unrealised foreign currency gains due to the appreciation of ringgit and rupiah against US dollar.
Meanwhile, the downstream segment’s PBIT tripled to RM202 million from RM72 million a year prior due to stronger performances from its Asia-Pacific and European operations.
Sime Darby Plantation explained that the Asia-Pacific region benefited from the market price uptrend and premium from higher sales volume of Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) products which compensated for lower demand for bulk products.
Its refineries in Europe recorded improved sales margins due to higher selling prices and more stringent cost controls measures which compensated for the lower demand from restrictions placed by governments to contain Covid-19.
Both regions also registered fair value gains on commodity hedges as compared to significant fair value losses incurred in the same quarter last year.
In a separate statement, Sime Darby Plantation chairman Tan Sri Megat Najmuddin Megat Khas said the higher palm oil prices were a blessing for all industry players in what had been one of the most challenging years in recent history for the global economy.
“Sime Darby Plantation is encouraged with its overall significantly better financial performance in 2020 and the group is hopeful that it will be able to carry this through in the current financial year."

1. Export tax of max 8% which is applicable now at today’s CPO price level.
2. Windfall tax of 3% for WM planters above price threshold of $2,500 and 1.5% for EM above threshold of $3,000. There is a formula for calculation published .
At today’s CPO $4,000, the export tax is $296 pmt , windfall tax is about $225 pmt. Total taxes are therefore $521 pmt. This leave the planters with ($4,0000 - 521) $3479 pmt . Production cost is $1,500-$2,000 depending on the efficiency of the planters . Gross profit is huge !

All this signs show a poorly run company, in a good situation.
If they can show an increase on the production level with the current high CPO price level, and some kind of increase efficiency with its planters, we will definitely see confidence on this company to increase its share price.

• With land bank spanning 98,200 ha, of which 79,400 ha is cultivated with oil palm, BPLANT stands to benefit from rising CPO prices. This comes as spot month forward CPO price has extended its uptrend with an incremental 15% jump since early February this year to RM3,920 per MT currently.
• Capturing the higher CPO price impact, the Group reported net profit of RM18.0m in 3QFY20 (versus 3QFY19’s net loss of RM34.3m and 2QFY20’s net profit of RM7.1m). The better performance was lifted by an average CPO selling price of RM2,772 per MT during the quarter, compared with 3QFY19’s RM2,026/MT and 2QFY20’s RM2,367/MT. This brought its nine-month earnings ended September 2020 to RM15.5m (-46% YoY).
• On the chart, after hitting a trough of RM0.20 during the market sell-off in March last year, the stock subsequently staged a steady recovery to plot higher lows along the way.
• With the share price currently treading near the ascending trendline, this presents a timely buying opportunity. Driven by the rising momentum indicator, BPLANT shares could continue the upward trajectory to test our resistance targets of RM0.64 (R1; 13% upside potential) and RM0.70 (R2; 24% upside potential).
• We have placed our stop loss price at RM0.50 (or 12% downside risk from its last traded price of RM0.565)."

Most underrated or unloved sector despite CPO trending higher and higher for the past 10-12 months. From an average traded $2,400 price jump to app 3,800 - 4,000 price level. {up +65%} even assuming a lower average price for the full year at 3,000 per tonne still a very healthy margin. Against cost of production of between 1.600 - 1,800 { excluding sale of PK credit for their bottom line} somehow prices does not equal to economical logic. Just my own view and take on cpo counters"

1. High interest charges due to loan taken to buy Sabah land by bplant
2. High depreciation charge due to more lands hold by bplant.
3. Recognition of gain on fv of biological assets by hsplant.
If you take out these 3 factors they have more of less the same profit margin. Conclusion- it boils down to lower yield from Sabah and Sarawak land. Hsplant have a yield of 21/hectare, bplant yield is 11/hectare."

Changes in Material Litigations
CIMB Islamic Trustee Berhad (""First Plaintiff""), trustee for Boustead Plantations Berhad and
Boustead Plantations Berhad (""Second Plaintiff"") had on 28 December 2018 filed a Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim on Setia Fontaines Sdn Bhd ('Defendant') for breach of Sale and Purchase Agreement dated 22 December 2016. The claim is in respect of damages amounting to RM37,207,353.35 for goods and services tax (GST) due from the Defendant together with interest at the rate of 8% per annum and other costs and relief deemed fit by the Court.
In July 2019, the Defendant filed an application for a judicial review against the Customs decision
that if the Lands are intended to be used for commercial or mixed development purposes, then the commercial portion is subject to GST. The Plaintiffs are not party to the said judicial review
proceedings. Pursuant to the court’s decision on the judicial review delivered on 11 September 2020, the Plaintiffs’ solicitors were informed that the court has decided, among others, that the sale of the Lands is an exempt supply under the GST (Exempt Supply) Order 2014 and is not subject to any
GST.
The Minister of Finance and the Director-General of Customs did not file any appeal against the
judicial review decision. The Group has therefore submitted a request to Customs in November 2020 for the GST refund of RM37,207,353.35.
As at 23 March 2021, there was no other material litigation involving the Group or the Company"

In some cases , you don’t care much of the business prospect eg Talam , Dutaland etc .. i think it is good that you look into both balance sheet , business prospects and track record as selection criteria.
Also, you tend to over promote or over sell the stock . Very good example is Bplant. When you do that it make you a ‘ snake oil salesman’. You just need to state your facts and opinions and that’s it,

The group said in a bourse filing that its wholly-owned subsidiaries Scientex Quatari Sdn Bhd and Scientex (Skudai) Sdn Bhd had entered into two sale and purchase agreements in relation to the proposed acquisition.
The first agreement is to acquire a piece of freehold agricultural land at Seberang Perai Utara, measuring approximately 82.84 hectares for RM147.13 million.
The second agreement is to acquire two pieces of freehold agricultural land at Seberang Perai Utara with an aggregate area of approximately 560,492 square meters for RM99.55 million.
The proposed acquisitions will be funded by internally-generated funds and bank borrowings, it said.
Scientex also said the proposed acquisitions represented a strategic investment opportunity to increase and boost the existing landbank of the group.
It said the positive response received by Scientex for its maiden development located at Tasek Gelugor, Penang indicated there was still strong and robust demand for affordable homes in Penang and Scientex intends to leverage on this demand to further expand its affordable homes brandname to other parts of Penang.
The Land is Located in Tasek Gelugor
82.84 hectares for Rm147.13 Millions
Let's calculate cost acre
To convert hectare to acre multiply by 2.471
So 82.84 x 2.471 = 204.687 acres
Now divide Rm147,130,000 by 204.687
= Rm718,804
SO SCIENTEX IS PAYING RM718804 PER ACRE
