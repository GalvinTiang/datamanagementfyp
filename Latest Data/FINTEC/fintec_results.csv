KUALA LUMPUR (Jul 15): Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said he may pay another visit to China, potentially Shenzhen again, to attract more investment into Malaysia.
Lim said although the US is the largest foreign investor in Malaysia and is expected to continue to increase, but the potential of China’s capital is increasing.
“China has its advantage, and the US has its advantage. These two countries are among the best in terms of foreign investment, and they are both very important,” he told local Chinese media Kwong Wah Daily in an interview last Saturday.
Lim said if he visits China again next month, his focus will be on investment, so one of the destinations would likely be Shenzhen, to attract high-tech, high-value Chinese major manufacturers to invest in Malaysia.
Lim also said after his first official visit to China earlier this month, both countries' governments are discussing the possibility of establishing an interactive channel for the stock exchanges of both countries.
Lim said he would discuss this further with Chinese authorities if his next visit to the country materialise.
""I hope we can yield some results in the near future,"" he said.
Lim said in addition to investment and business, both countries also hope to strengthen securities and stock exchanges areas.
After a visit to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, Lim said they are studying whether it is possible to create a new platform that makes both capital and stock markets more competitive, and gain more access to financing.
Lim said this would require further works to be done, including formulation of the technological process and financing mechanism.
Lim hopes that after visiting China, he could accelerate the materialisation of this objective.
On the matter of potential raising of Panda bonds from banks in China, Lim said the Malaysian government is still considering it, as the government thinks that it deserves a lower interest rate.
Meanwhile, Lim said after visiting Huawei’s operation in Shenzhen and meeting its management, the technology giant pledged to strengthen its investment in Malaysia.
Lim also said representatives from Huawei will organise a visit to Malaysia as well, and he is scheduled to meet them to discuss more on the company’s potential implementation of 5G technology in Malaysia.
""They will come in a week or two. When I am in Penang, I will discuss with them,"" he said."

KUALA LUMPUR (July 22): The government is committed to supporting local technology companies to become multinational corporations through the Global Acceleration and Innovation Network (GAIN) programme administered by the Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC).
Communications and Multimedia Minister Gobind Singh Deo said this was in line with the move towards making Malaysia a leader in the digital economy.
He underscored that the GAIN initiative under MDEC was one of the programmes that the government had put in place to assist Malaysian technology firms to grow and expand their reach both regionally and globally via its four pillars of market access, risk capital, tech refresh and visibility.
Spurred by the success stories of GAIN members, he announced further improvements to the programme when addressing the launch and townhall session at the Macrokiosk Founding Office here today.
In this regard, he said, GAIN would continue to expand its market access to establish business support ecosystems in new countries and locations such as Australia, Taiwan, Japan and the Middle East.
""On top of that, GAIN is committed to organising more mentoring and coaching workshops for its member companies to enable them to raise investment capital, as well as prepare for initial public offering (IPO) listings by connecting them to global investors and exposing them to global media,"" Gobind said.
Stating that he was personally committed to ensuring the success of the GAIN initiative, Gobind said there were currently about 150 companies under the programme and they were fast becoming regional market leaders in big data, internet of things (IoT), drone, e-commerce, cybersecurity and payments, to name a few.
""I am made to understand that Macrokiosk is one of them and it now operates on a global scale with a presence in 14 countries,"" he said.
The minister shared that over the past year, he had asked MDEC to place focus on the programme in order to accelerate the progress of GAIN companies, and that they had really upped the game in their respective fields during that period.
In highlighting GAIN success stories, the minister touched on a local drone company, Aerodyne, which had signed a significant deal in Japan to provide drone-based services for infrastructure management, both within Japan and on behalf of their overseas-based Japanese companies.
Gobind also shone the spotlight on Soft Space, a local company and one of Asia's leading fintech players, which had recently launched a new technology to make card payments more accessible for smaller businesses, and was now eyeing to make the service available during the Tokyo Olympics next year.
He also spoke about Securemetric, a GAIN member and regional leader which provides cybersecurity solutions, which had a successful listing on the ACE Market in November 2018 and now had a market capitalisation of RM130 million.
Gobind expressed confidence that more companies would be able to benefit through GAIN and contribute to a sustainable digital economy, with diversity and inclusivity at its core.
""We must bear in mind that as we embark on the digital journey, we don't exclude or leave behind those who are not as fortunate or come from marginalised communities,"" he said.
He stressed that it was paramount that they were included in plans and commitments to enable all Malaysians to benefit from the 'Kemakmuran Bersama' that could be gained from the digital economy.
Gobind said he was pleased that GAIN participants had adopted a culture of 'pay it forward’ and had been nurturing and mentoring other startups.
“Many of these companies are also investing in these startups and helping them navigate towards becoming regional players,” he said, adding that this was something the government would like to further encourage.
Gobind pointed out this was because these mentorship activities helped to collectively grow and mature the tech entrepreneur ecosystem in Malaysia itself.
He also urged all companies to keep abreast of the latest technology and constantly innovate to stay ahead of the competition."

Fintec Global’s wholly-owned subsidiary Asiabio Capital Sdn Bhd is buying the stake from Koh Hong Muan @ Koh Gak Siong and Aimas Enterprise Sdn Bhd, the group said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia.
It is acquiring a 15.81% stake in Komarkcorp from Koh and 4.01% stake from Aimas, in which Koh also owns a 16.7% interest.
The other shareholders of Aimas are Koh Chie Jooi, Koh Chee Mian, Koh Chee Kian, Koh Chee Hao and Lee Poh Tin. Each of them own a 16.66% stake.
Fintec Global said the acquisition will be funded entirely from internally-generated funds.
The group said this acquisition is intended to allow it to capitalise on the market’s current high demand for security prints or codes like Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFID) and Quick Response Code (QR Codes).
“Komarkcorp has invested heavily in machineries that has the capability to develop and produce new products such as digital personalized labels, variable data prints and security prints,” it said.
Fintec Global also said Komarkcorp, which has been loss-making since financial year ended April 30, 2017, has the potential to turn around its financial performance if it adapts to the market’s changes and demands.
Fintec Global’s share price gained 0.5 sen or 11.1% to five sen today, giving it a market capitalisation of RM30.7 million."

KUALA LUMPUR (Sept 20): Digital payments are becoming the preferred payment method in Malaysia, with 70% of consumers preferring to visit merchant sites that accept digital payments compared to those that only accept cash, according to the Visa Consumer Payment Attitudes Study 2018.
In a statement today, Visa Inc said among the merchant categories that consumers expect higher usage of digital payments are large shopping malls (65%), supermarkets (60%) and bill payments (57%).
""Over half of the respondents expect their use of digital payments to increase over the next year,"" it said.
Visa said the respondents believe the digital payments are convenient, hassle free and accepted widely.
They also believe that going cashless offers better payment security and allow them to track their expenditure better, it said.
However, for small transactions, the respondents still prefer paying with cash.
Visa country manager for Malaysia Ng Kong Boon said the financial services corporation sees a similar trend based on its VisaNet data, where the total value of consumer spending on Visa and number of transactions have shown double-digit percentage increase year-on-year.
""There are, however, continued opportunities for growth as cash still accounts for more than 60% of consumer spending in Malaysia,"" he said.
Ng said Visa has been focusing its efforts on expanding merchant contactless acceptance in Malaysia, adding that the nation is now one of the fastest growing countries in Asia Pacific in terms of contactless payment usage.
""To date, we have enabled contactless payments acceptance in major merchant categories such as petrol stations, supermarkets, quick service restaurants and laundromats.
""We are confident that our goal of becoming a cashless nation is moving a step closer because merchants and consumers appreciate the frictionless payments experience brought about by digital payments,"" he said."

Back in those days, if anybody can recall PATIMAS. Tan Sik Eek was newly joined. The company got into some issues and some Directors were involved in CBT Case. Tan Sik Eek wasn’t involved but he came out to help solve the company issue but was misrepresented by others. Mr Tan left the company and start it out with another Director. U read yourself. This MR Tan is smart. It took him few years to turnaround the company in Asiabio. I hope he continues to do a better job.
Incubator companies help to start up new companies or crowd funding and in other words , to turnaround a companies step by step. They are careful in selecting those companies and slowly polish the coal into diamond."

U see, corrected taken place last Dec 2018, and that was approx.ly 1 year ago and many stocks have dived to at least 10 years lowest. For example, GAMUDA, dived to 2.03 and look at it today. When it dived, many investors sell it off so quickly and vow never return to the market. Last 2 days, I was having a gathering with friends. Some friends are selling off their stocks because seeing the losses that they find it hard to bare. But I’m not one of these people that will do that. I stay patient.
Warren Buffet said, be fearful when people are greedy.
For FINTEC, should you be fearful ? OR SHOULD YOU BE GREEDY?
not many people see the true value of FINTEC at this present time because according to TA, it’s a complete at KOYAK trend,
So, now it takes time for people like u who are here, still juggling whether or not what I am saying is true.
When at 4 cents, those who hold were butt hurt. Saying they bought at such lousy counter. No prospects and it’s a Goreng company.
At 5.5 cents earlier, people like Johnchew came and caught a stir and twist and blame saying I am punter.
At 6.5 cents, people like Chan kuan long said later will be like vsolar , trick people to buy and later they sell.
At 7 to 7.5 cents,there are people started saying umtooi and aiyoh , why did I sell...
So all these is because u guys wanna sell for small profits!!!
Be PATIENT!
KEEP ACCUMULATING WHILE U CAN. 10 AND 14 is very close soon!!!"

The ICPS may be converted into new fully-paid Shares at theConversion Price in the following manner:-
(i) by surrendering 2 ICPS (which are issued at an issue price of RM0.08 each) without additional cash payment to arrive at the Conversion Price of RM0.16 for 1 new Share; or
(ii) by surrendering 1 ICPS (which is issued at an issue price of RM0.08 each) with additional cash payment of RM0.08 to arrive at the Conversion Price of RM0.16 for 1 new Share.Premised on the terms of the ICPS, subject to adjustments, the ICPS can be converted into new Fintec Shares on any market day commencing on and including the issue date of the ICPS up to and including the maturity date.Any ICPS that are not converted would be mandatorily converted into new Fintec Shares on the maturity date.If the conversion results in a fractional entitlement to Fintec Shares, such fractional entitlement shall be disregarded and no refund or credit, whether in the form of the ICPS, cash or otherwise,shall be given in respect of the disregarded fractional entitlement.If the maturity date of the ICPS falls on a non-market day, then it will fall on the preceding market day.
可以按以下方式以转换价将ICPS转换为新的缴足股款：-
（i）交回2份ICPS（以每股0.08令吉的发行价发行）而无需支付额外现金，以换得1股新股的转换价为0.16令吉；要么
（ii）交回1份ICPS（以每股0.08令吉的发行价发行）并额外支付0.08令吉的现金，以换得1股新股的转换价为0.16令吉。 ICPS可进行调整，可在ICPS发行日（包括当日）（包括到期日）的任何市场日将ICPS转换为新的Fintec股份。任何未转换的ICPS将强制转换为新的Fintec。到期日的股份。如果转换导致获得Fintec股份的部分权利，则应忽略该部分权利，并且对于被忽略的份额，不得以ICPS，现金或其他形式给予退款或信贷如果ICPS的到期日在非市场日，则它将在前一个市场日。"

you can also get about 10,000 units of such bargain priced houses

Put money in bank is risky business. Many didn't know money in banks are meant for cash flow.
What are the risks like?
1. risk of death. Frozen and need to claim from LA takes years.
2. risk of LHDN investigation
3. Risk of inflation
4. Risk of skim cepat kaya
5. Risk of people calling you everyday
6. Risk of spending."

Its investment holding of Focus, Netx, AT(S), Vsolar, DGB, Mlabs, Seacera and TNB has a market value of Rm330 million. Basing on the closing price of all the above mentioned stocks on 31/12/2019, for the next quarterly earning report for quarter ending 31/12/2019, My estimate for Fintec's earning is about 15 sens a share with NTA of 50 sens a share due to 'marked to market value' for all its investment holdings."

=====================================
Dont forget there's also 900M PA shares, thats convertible at minimal cost to 450M mother share, at 5 c thats RM22.5 million ""stealth"" market map
Granted, some of these already converted, so not quite RM60M cap at 5 cents, but more like RM55M.
And not even counting potential dilution from the warrants. 130M Warrant A at 0.3 and 90M Warrant B at 0.15 exercise price
At the current level, its not likely to be dilutionary since doesnt make sense to convert but at your valuation it will be.
So a lot of recalculations there, if you want to use fully diluted earnings for your valuation."

It announced yesterday buying additional 8m komark shares at 50c, 29.5c higher than the current stock price at 20.5c. Savvy investor will acquire another company at a good discount to its intrinsic value but the generous one will buy more at a hefty 150% premium. The additional 8m shares can be acquired in the open market at around 21c-23c easily. Y Fintec is willing to pay the hefty premium for it? your guess is as good as mine. I wont be surprise if fintec making more announcements b4 the 29/2/2020 dateline on buying more komark shares from the priviledged group members at 50c a piece.

KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 20): Smart farming, aerospace and the digital economy can play a big role in injecting new dynamism in Malaysia's bid to become a high-income economy, said Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali.
He said the three sectors can also create a wider range of job opportunities and raise living standards of everyone in the effort to face the challenges of Industry 4.0.
Twenty-one industry experts in smart farming, aerospace and the digital economy have provided their inputs for immediate attention by the Government in its efforts to explore and galvanise the economic potential in these three sectors,he said in a statement here today.
Mohamed Azmin said the engagement sessions he chaired today with these prime movers in their respective sectors are very important in fine-tuning the needs and priorities in the ongoing process of formulating the 12th Malaysia Plan (12MP).
He said these efforts show the Government’s commitment to ensure the views of all quarters are taken into account, with comprehensive details implemented to determine the nation’s direction of development for the next five years.
The 12MP, which is expected to be tabled in the Dewan Rakyat in August, is the first phase in the implementation of the Shared Prosperity Vision 2030 (SPV2030).
The preparation of the 12MP will be based on three objectives of SPV2030 — development for all, addressing wealth and income disparities, and forging a united, prosperous and dignified nation.
The engagement sessions were also attended by Deputy Economic Affairs Minister Senator Dr Mohd Radzi Md Jidin, Bumiputera Agenda Steering Unit (TERAJU) chairman Datuk Seri Mustapa Mohamed, Economic Affairs Ministry secretary-general Datuk Saiful Anuar Lebai Hussen, senior officials of the Ministry, and the 12MP drafting team"

May 15, 2020
KUALA LUMPUR: Small and mid-cap stocks offer better value at the moment given that their large-cap peers have staged solid rebounds off their March lows, RHB Investment Bank Bhd (RHB IB) said.
Shares of small-cap companies had lagged behind in staging strong recovery rebounds from Bursa Malaysia's March 18 dip, the bank said.
RHB IB chief executive officer Robert Huray said alpha hunting remained a daunting task for most investors against the backdrop of heightened uncertainties in light of Covid-19.
This was given the fact that Bursa's key index FBMKLCI had rallied vigorously, narrowing its year-to-date (YTD) losses to 13 per cent.
This had ultimately raised the question of further upside potential for big liquid stocks, Hurray said at the virtual launch of RHB Top 20 Malaysia Small Cap Jewels 2020 (RHB Top 20) book here today,
He said the small-mid cap space had offered investors a 27 per cent gain versus a -4.4 per cent for FBMKLCI last year.
The segment, though, is still off from its peak by a much wider margin, down 23 per cent YTD.
""With the fate of many bigger companies tied to waning external demand, low commodity prices and dwindling capacity to spend locally, chances of finding winners in the new norm post Covid-19 will be higher for smaller and nimbler companies that can better capitalise on emerging opportunities,"" Huray said.
RHB Top 20 features 20 names for investors to consider during this challenging period in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Hurray said its top 20 firms had collectively outperformed the FBM KLCI and the FBM Small Cap Index with a holding period return of 20 per cent since the book's launch last May.
RHB IB head of regional equity research Alexander Chia said it had begun to see value in the market in a longer-term perspective, despite the elevated risk environment as the result of Covid-19.
""We believe the launch of the book is well-timed as we are seeing strong demand for alpha rich small-mid caps stocks that are resilient and can survive the on-going turmoil,"" Chia added.
In this year's book, the largest stock by market cap, at RM1.7 billion, is Mi Technovation, while the smallest is Advancecon Holdings Bhd at RM122 million.
Of the top 20 ""jewels"", 65 per cent have a market cap of less than RM500 million.
The trailing median price-to-earnings-ratio and return on equity of this year's pick are 12.6 times and 11.7 per cent respectively.
The RHB Top 20 forms part of the larger RHB Regional Small Cap Compendium that annually lists stock investment ideas from RHB IB's research teams in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand.
RHB IB said companies in this year's book have market capitalisation of below RM2 billion, from 10 different industry segments with the biggest representation coming from the technology and industrial products and services sectors.
The screening process took into consideration the companies' spread and size, managements' credibility, industry fundamentals, earnings growth potential, industry track record and its level of corporate governance."

The Group is primarily involved in technology incubation, portfolio investment and
provision of biotechnology products and services. Through its technology incubation
activities, the Group provides management and strategic advisory services, research
related activities, business networking and funding for its incubatee companies with
the objective of commercialising technologies in the bio-energy and biotechnology
sectors.
Apart from technology incubation, the Group also holds investments in listed
companies for the medium to long term with exposure to various business sectors as
follows:-
Energy Engineering Food and beverage
Financial and
information technology
Vsolar Group
Berhad (“Vsolar”)
AT
Systematization
Berhad
Focus Dynamics
Group Berhad
(“Focus”)
NetX Holdings Berhad
(“Netx”)
MLABS Systems Berhad
DGB Asia Berhad
In addition to the above, Fintec holds several investments in non-listed companies
that are involved in the agricultural technology industry such as Artisan Semesta Sdn
Bhd and Eco-Sponge Sdn Bhd (marketing and production of microbial fertilizer
supplements) as well as Hexa Bonanza Sdn Bhd (a contractor and technology
provider for biomass pelletizing and related equipment). The Group also holds a
property investment holding company (Pinnacle Nexus Sdn Bhd). Fintec also holds
an investment in Fintec Capital Sdn Bhd (formerly known as Asiabio Petroleum Sdn
Bhd), a company which intends to undertake the provision of, amongst others,
general loans, micro and corporate financing services as well as any other credit
services in relation thereto.
The Proposed Private Placement is proposed to be undertaken to raise funds mainly
for investment in the healthcare equipment manufacturing and/or trading business as
well as working capital. The investment in healthcare equipment manufacturing
and/or trading business is aimed at generating an additional stream of income to the
Group while capitalising on the global shortage of PPE resulting from the COVID-19
pandemic. The additional working capital funds will help to facilitate the Group’s
existing day-to-day operations as a whole while the Group focuses on managing its
investments in various companies.
The Group is confident that its current investment strategy of identifying suitable and
viable new businesses for investment as well as preserving value of its existing
medium to long term holdings in quoted strategic investments will mitigate downside
risk for its incubation fund arising from the wide-ranging effects of the COVID-19
pandemic to the local and global economy. Once recovery in the economic
environment gains momentum, the overall portfolio value of the Group will be
enhanced.
Premised on the above, the Board is optimistic of the future prospects of the Group
moving forward."

KUALA LUMPUR (June 23): Technology sector will see ""powerful acceleration"" growth in both revenue and earnings, according to Franklin Templeton Investments.
""Once we get through this crisis, we're going to start seeing very powerful acceleration, not only in revenue but in earnings for this sector,"" said Jonathan Curtis, vice-president of Franklin Equity Group at Franklin Templeton Investments, in ""Tech Sector in the Post Pandemic World"" webinar session today.
""Investors are so positive about this sector right now. Because coming out of this crisis, it (the tech sector) is well positioned to drive very strong growth,"" he said.
Curtis highlighted that the expected exponential growth would materialise in the coming three to five years.
""The Covid-19 [pandemic] has accelerated the opportunity in this space and we think coming out of this current challenge, we are going to see an acceleration in technology investment,"" said Curtis.
In terms of valuation, Curtis said the sector's valuation is reasonable, given its long-term growth potential and high quality of growth.
He believes that the IT sector's valuation is elevated but not excessive, and when compared with valuations of the S&P 500, the tech index is only at an 8% premium currently.
Curtis pointed out that the price-to-earnings multiple on S&P 500 info technology index of 25.01 times currently is nowhere near the level in 1999 to 2000 of over 50 times. ""Thus, we don't think this is a bubble,"" he said.
On the local front, technology stocks can be seen swarming the top gainers list in the recent three months. Bursa Malaysia technology index, from this year's low of 23.81 points in March, has jumped 73.2% to 41.24 points at the time of writing.
The stellar performance of the four FANG stocks has helped fuel the upward trend among Malaysian tech stocks. All three Apple Inc, Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc have just hit a record high on Wall Street.
Alphabet Inc, on the other hand, has rebounded US$400 to US$1,451.86 from the low in March.
Curtis expressed his optimism about the tech sector, saying that its growth ""is going to go on for a long time"" on the back of digital transformation.
""The big opportunity in this space is digital transformation,"" said Curtis, saying that it will be supported by growth drivers such as artificial intelligence, fintech, internet of things, and 5G technology, among many others.
Curtis said the demand and the need to use the technology have really soared during the Covid-19 pandemic.
""We needed to learn how to work from home, educate from home, shop from home, exercise from home, healthcare from home, socialise from home and dine out from home,"" he said, adding that there has been a massive retraining of consumers on how the services work and what it could do, during the lockdown.
Curtis noted that consumers and businesses are going to continue to use these digital services and that retraining will continue not just until a vaccine is broadly administered, but even post the Covid-19 crisis.
Furthermore, he said that the tech sector has a ""very good quality"" being the third-most profitable sector across the S&P 500 by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation margins, adding that it is also one of the few S&P 500 sectors that are net cash positive."

金科全球第四季每股盈利为8.29仙，然而股价仅有6仙。
金科全球向大马交易所报备，表示净利大增，主要是所持的投资产品价格大涨，为集团贡献净利。
该公司今日的业绩报告中，并未解释＂增值证＂的详情，只表示相关资产增值6719万令吉，并贡献5403万令吉。
金科全球在去年九月时，曾以1640万令吉，收购国马(KOMARK 7017)的19.82%股权。根据过去记录，金科全球持有多家微型上市公司显着股权。
金科全球的每股净有形资产为51仙，但过去三年来，其股价从20仙水平，一路滑跌至10仙以下水平。
2020财政年来说，金科全球净利为2亿2669万令吉，比2019财年增长%。
累积四个季度每股盈利为23.4仙，股价仅有不到每股盈利四份之一，这种诡异情况，该公司没有向市场解释，投资大众更不解这一团谜。
金科全球缴足股本为9亿6800万股，以6仙股价计算，市值为5800万令吉。"

No doubt, Fintec/ Asio Bio is an investment company, which owned only share equites, one thing I like about this company is THEY REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING!
It's only they go against your direction OR THEY GO WITH YOUR FLOW.

It can be anyone or operators doing it to impresse investors. A lot of investors being misled that Credit Susse a big name is buying Sharesd"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000170.jsp?ftp=409","Jul 4, 2020 7:42 PM","Investor 9999","Focus is another Malaysia Boleh Co. At RM1.01 the market capitalization of RM2.065 billion. It has poor financial performance for both the top and bottom line in the last 5 Financial Years.
The net asset or total equity of the Co as at 31 March 2020 was RM41.5 mil though its paid up share capital was RM86.97 mil. The CO has accumulated losses incurred since its listing of RM46.8 mil. Surprisingly, the share price kept creeping up dubiously. Howe could the market so illogically valued it at RM2.065 bil compared to its net asset of RM41.5 mil.
Poor investors could get burn to ashes when reality check come and noted its financial cannot justify the share price. Price being goreng up and cornered by the main players with self interest could only explained the illogical price of RM1.01
I am amazed Focus is valued at RM2.065 bil. I noted the key shareholder is Fintec with 25.3 %. Studying list of 30 top shareholders and changes in substantial shareholders noted most shares are all held thru Credit Suisse Dublin and HK plus other reputable overseas Nominees without naming the beneficiaries to let the market think big names are holding the shares.
I WONDER WHY WOULD INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS WOULD WANT TO INVEST IN SUCH POOR FINANCIAL CO. I think this is certainly unlikely but most probably proxies of interested parties or operators who has interest in pushing its share price up and misleading the market with international names buying the shares.
From the 31 Dec 2019 Annual Report, it turnover was RM39 mil and reported a net loss of RM1.89 mil. Look at the financial summary below for the last 5 financial years and note that except for FY 2017, the Co reported losses for last 5 Financial years from 2015 and turnover for the Co has been less than RM39 mil.
Review the Q1 31 March 2002, the Group’s revenue decreased marginally from RM9.95 million in corresponding quarter of last year to RM9.28 million in the current quarter, representing a decrease of RM0.67 million or 6.72%. When compared to the preceding Q4, the Group registered a decrease in revenue to RM9.28 million from RM9.95 million in the preceding quarter, representing a decrease of 6.72% or RM0.67 million. The Group registered a PAT of RM0.75 million as compared to LAT of 3.03 million in the preceding quarter due to impairment loss of financial assets of RM2.16 million, Interest of Right of Use Assets (“RUA”) of RM0.56 million and depreciation of RUA of RM1.30 million during the quarter with the adoption of MFRS 16 for FYE 31 December 2019.
The question investor got to ask is the Co worth RM2.065 bil. The share price is 1.01 and for FY 2019 and 2018, it reported loss earning per share of 0.09 Sen and 0.16 Sen respectively. Q1 2020 earning per share 0.04 Sen"

You ask Fintec tomorrow throw 10% 51mil share of focus dynamic to open market, u see anyone buy? even it sold at 20sen also nobody want to buy.
All the investment hold by FINTEC are those palia company which not worth money, all the value you calculate here is fake 1, it is something not real.

I have no idea why focus is RM1. So, i believe that fintec should not be greedy and start selling focus dynamics to materialize profit. When fintec's cash deposit is RM150mil. Then, fintec will bounce to at least 15-20sen with market cap equivalent to it's cash deposit."

This company is an investment company which mainly invest in many tech-companies. Based on the company name, summary and business goals. It all seems like a perfect company to invest, it is proven that technology companies usually makes the most profit among all others.
It is normal if they don't make profit for 5-10 years or even more, because people are willing to invest and hold. Just like apple, amazon, microsoft, and many other tech companies that took many years of lost before their products becomes a sensation and make huge profit. It takes a long effort before the tech are marketed and becomes profitable.
BUT
After spending few hours into Fintec annual reports, subsidiaries, and their products and service.
I got to say this company doesn't have a bright future. Take one of its biggest sub-company, NetX, the main product of NetX is GemSpot. Have you downloaded the app and seen how awful it is? It is suppose to be like FoodPanda but its nowhere like that, its been out for 2 years yet it takes 1 year for the admin to even reply a review.
I've looked into all of the tech companies under Fintec, Its all very hallow and like dummy companies, pretending to do work but actually it not, their main profit investors money, as long as they can keep this ""we all can be rich"" act, people will keep pumping money and they will keep spending for themselves.
Tech is all about diciplined, dedication to their work, and most importantly progress, and there's no progress in their products for many years.
My conclusion, this is a dummy company, along with all its subsidiaries. If you're in profit, get out now, and if you're thinking of buying, dont."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000170.jsp?ftp=420","Aug 5, 2020 4:22 PM","Fundamentalist91","Let me give an example of another tech company - Gpacket.
It doesn't make any profit for many years as well, but investors see progress, see products, see effort.
So investors are willing to put money in despite losses, the market cap is RM500 million, that is a very big amount for a company that doesn't make profit, but because there's a consistency in progress, dedication, that's why investors stays.
For Fintec, the market cap is small, RM100 Mil + , so its easy to move it limit up or limit down. As for why the market cap is small, its because no serious investor are willing to invest long term in this stock.

Luring people to come to buy its penny syndicate stock. No bonus and dividends given. Another red flag sign.

On top of that, it pushes medical and healthcare sectors to the extreme because the world demand for SAFETY AND SANITISATION.

The prime minister said representatives of the major tech firms expressed their interest at a meeting with him recently.
“I think many have shown their interest in helping Malaysia. Recently the leaders of Microsoft, Amazon and Google met with me expressing their readiness to be involved in the process of developing Malaysia in the IT and other fields to make Malaysia a regional centre.
“But first, to make sure, does our country have the best connectivity? The main issue usually raised is lack of access. Our Internet is not efficient,” he said at a town hall session with state and federal civil servants in Johor here today.
Muhyiddin, who is also Pagoh MP, also said Malaysia has not achieved a competitive level of Internet connectivity, citing the example of a schoolgirl in Sabah who had to climb a tree to get good Internet access.
He said while the government’s commitment to improving its Internet connectivity is already there, the time has come to step forward to expand access.
In June, Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS) student Veveonah Mosibin, 18, of Kampung Sapatalang in Pitas, Sabah uploaded YouTube videos of her spending the night in a tree to get better Internet access for her online university examinations.
The videos have since been viewed over 150,000 times."

5 Years from now when Fintec cashes out it's 1.25bil stake in Focus and park in Fintec's cash balances and pay 20 sen dividend. The stupid menort that refuses to buy at 6 sen, 12 sen, 16sen because there were no dividend in the past will come buy from RJ 87 at RM1 when fintech declares 20sen dividend. Then, I will ask the STUPID menort why didnt he buy at 6sen, 12sen and 16sen =D
Personally, I have a principle. When ah tu ah kao come say should buy glove, glove is good. Then I will sell. It's F*CKING priced in and there is no more upside.
Use ur brain if you have any. Topglove is trading at PE109. Given covid don't go away, it's takes u 109 years to gain back ur RM26.280 dollars investment. And for RM26.280 worth of investment, they only pay back investors 10sen dividend. THAT'S A JOKE!"

This clearly shows that Fintec is beginning to monetize and sell shares and exit some companies while reinvesting it in new ventures like Saudee which they recently bought at 40 cents.
Yes it’s all Nta for now without any dividend. But it’s important to judge at what stage this company at, will they start monetizing more and more of their investment and divest for cash??"

let listen to what Warren Buffet said : it has better things to do with its shareholders' cash.
Fintec will reinvest your money to other stocks to continue grow their assets, NTA and profit. This is how investment company workout. First of all, they need to win money from trading or investment (paper gain or cash out) , if they success consistently to make profit or paper gain to grow their assets, then they are good investment company.
Look at their biggest portfolio focus, how much it raise from July to now and this will be reflected as paper gain in their next QR.
Nothing wrong or right. Retailer must do their own study and manage their own risk, don't listen to anyone. 10 years ago - ""facebook can't make profit"", 2 years ago - ""tesla is in big lost"".
The best is trying to study as much as possible. Then make your own judgement.

2) why the company placed out private placement of 284 million shares, which is 30% of the company's enalarged share base, in July 2020 at low issue price of 5.35 cent for 100 million shares and 7.11 cent for 184 million shares?

I KIV INSAS quite a while liao. PE38, hardly 2% DY. Overpriced despite very low PTBV.
100mil shares @ 5.35cen when it was trading at 5-6sen is legit if compared than ARBB 1.4BILLION or Ageson 4BILLION ICPS at 0.01. ONE sen. ONE. Might as well just give free.
When it was trading at 5-6sen during the exercise. Why u didn't pok pek pok pek then?
If mothershare was trading at 6sen that time, u do private placement at 7sen, are you s*hai enough to go buy? Which s*hai will subscribe to raise this fund. You only buy whatever exercise when it's trading below market value ma. THAT TIME, below market value was 5.35sen.
Now, that MANY MONTHS after the exercise, share price has risen to 16sen only come pok pek pok pek about the 5.35sen? If that time, Fintec didn't raise this money, where they get fund to invest in counters to profit from current crazy market? My question back to you, why didn't you buy at 6sen?
Who knows...next exercise will be at 23-24sen per share when the market is trading at 26-28sen.
Then u wanna come pok pek pok pek about the 5.35sen again? You have no concept of time is it?PLEASE USE ABIT OF YOUR BRAIN IF THERE IS ANYTHING UP THERE.

2) Crosscheck the date of price fixing with the market value. Then, u have ur answer.
If corporate proposal was to issue 1bil shares. If possible; they would wanna issue at way higher price. BUT, when they really need cash when opportunity comes. They hv to choice to issue at discount at whatever market price at that point.
Why didn't u make argument on why management don't issue PP at 1sen? Why 5.35sen? Genius...Why why why? A real scammer would hve issued it at 1sen (LIKE YOU KNOW WHO LA) and if possible FOC la."

Fintec is very similar to Berkshire Hathaway (Warran Buffet's company). Both of them don't pay dividend. Even Malaysia Icapital also don't pay dividend. Why?
Let listen to what warren buffet said :
It has better things to do with its shareholder's cash.
Berkshire Halthaway won big money from coca-cola,facebook,apple and many more : But they dont pay dividend. Instead of that, they reinvest the money. Thus, Berkshire Halthaway becomes more value, and it will be reflected on their share price.
Thus, don't expect fintec to pay dividend, unless in very special circumstances.
But the NTA will become bigger and bigger, and it will be reflected on their share price.
Simple logic : if you want to buy facebook shares, and it is too expensive. If berkshire halthaway is cheap, then you just acquire berkshire halthaway to indirectly hold the super expensive facebook shares, It does not make sense, portfolio is assets, and it will be reflected on berkshire halthaway."

This counter ""forever"" wont pay dividend, but does not mean it is scam. This is how investment company work out. Icapital don't pay dividend, Warran Buffet's company also wont pay dividend.
The reason is simple. They can utilise the money better than anyone of us. They reinvest the money to continue grow the company. Thus, the company become bigger.
If you are looking for dividend, please sell the shares. Please do it. Because it won't pay single sen to you as dividend. But when their NTA become bigger, then you will start realise that you miss the boat. Take warran buffet's company as case study.
Set your own strategies. No harm to take profit and no harm to wait longer for better income (No one know how long you need to wait for)."

When the company make profit or receive some lucrative contracts, some management will hide them. At the same time, they will use tools such private placement and employee share option scheme (ESOS) to help their cronies, and relative accumulate shares at lower prices. Once they bought enough, their cronies will then push the share price up, they will create bullish sentiment with the use of some splendid news or financial report announcements, and subsequent sell their shares to minority shareholders at inflated prices. In my opinion, the situation of Fintec is totally similar with what KYY have mentioned in his book. Therefore, even I still believe FINTEC is undervalued and high probability that it will boost up more in the future, you guys ( the new buyers) should not chase high if it really limit up in the future or increase significantly in the future. And also, I think the current price is quite reasonable for investors to purchase.

The issue price of the rights shares has yet to be fixed, but at an indicative price of 8 sen per share, the technology incubator hopes to raise at least RM15 million from the cash call. To meet the minimum subscription level, Fintec has procured an undertaking from its executive director Tan Sik Eek, to apply and subscribe in full for his rights entitlement, and any additional rights shares not taken up by other entitled shareholders to the extent that at least RM15 million is raised from the exercise."

I have been telling few week back.
Make money still PP .No buisness expansions,less revenue on the real buisness,Not even a single cts dividen or whatever just to make investor happy.
Borrow your money without giving anything.
Midterm if smart can make 20 to 30% from price movements but it takes time and it really make you feel very bad.They make money for their own benefits.and swallow your money 100%.
They have nothing ti be proud of and there are NO trend and theme to play.Better believe but can verify scroll up and you will learn something.
It will move up but it will takes 3 to 6 months.
DONT EVER TRY TO PLAY CONTRA!
Best bargain 10 to 12.5 cts only.

Long Term Investment must come with dividen if PLC make big money..FYR make 151 million and what did you get.

This counter is a con company is based on your own judgement on how the company is run now.
By asking question here and to decide buy and sell, more like a Genting gambler.
Money can be make and loss in this counter if youknow what you doing.
1) Why FINTEC never sell those incubator that in paper profit? Using the unrealised marketable share price to boost NTA? So many in paper profit KOMARK, SAUDEE, FOCUS, AT. why keep holding and subscribe to the RI of incubator? When FINTEC start to invest in those incubator, you think they bought at current price? MLAB, DGBASIA how much money they burn? Go and check those company.
2) How many times FINTEC has issued SIS and PP below market price during this 1 year? Go and check the company announcement and Annual report and see those who subscribe to SIS and PP still holding the shares?.Check the top 30 investors how many percent they hold? Between the price they subscribe SIS and PP against the market price, how much they can earn by just subscribe and sell at market price? So you still asking why price cannot move up?
3) Why the director only buy 100K shares and not buy more? Instead wait to subscribe excess right which wont get if all full subscription? He no confident in current market price and expect not many to subscribe the RI?
4) Who will benefit if the RI is price at 0.08. Why price so low? Why use the price near the lowest to price and not current price and give so much discount? If director fully subscribe and sell all, you see how much he can earn from the RI + free warrant while the existing shareholder keep holding their share thinking why NTA so high but share price never go up. If those didnt subscribe will be worse, didnt average down purchase price and hold at high.
5) Why still proposal stage for RI? Still need EGM for approval.
6) Is the director really running the company properly? Run out of idea to ask shareholder? Propose to do glove only now? 1 of the incubator AT is doing glove also. Why not buy more AT share and ownself go and do glove? No experience and want to compete against existing big 4 and 2nd liner glove? Is it like throwing shareholder money into longkang and then ask for more money?
7) Just look at those incubator FINTEC invest in. Is it all really good company? For the pass 5 years what is their revenue, how many MOU announce and realise, how many Right Issue announcement, how many got court case? Why invest in this company? What so special? Buy and never sell even in paper profit but keep asking for more cash from shareholder."

Only you still worship the Director and talking about macai here and there.
You don't need to guess this and that what I am saying.
Just open your big eyes and read bursa announcement and see how the Director profit from SIS, PP and RI while the so long shareholder like you still holding the shares.
Don't forget FINTEC got share consolidation 1 for 3 in 2017.
Did you incurred losses during this exercise. Only you know.
Let the Director issue more shares at high discount and then do another round of share consolidation and see you happy or not with all the dilution and share price.

You know what I want you to see?
Look at the 30 biggest shareholders holding.
Does it match with the amount of shares each PP and SIS exercise?
Do you think those who subscribe still holding or already sold all the discount shares with profit based on market price?
30 biggest shareholders only holding 18% of the total FINTEC shares. the balance 82% who hold and the largest shareholder outside of 30 top shareholder is less than 4M shares.
What kind of so good company no big shareholder want to hold? Making big profit wor.
Where is the director name? Oh yeah director only holding 333,333 shares only.
Director why hold so little. No confident this is a hidden gem company?

Please remember most of your holding companies are not making money. Netx, Mlab, Vsolar, AT, etc and you acquired a Pn17 Seacera.
I believed you also good at TECHNICAL ANALYSIS and often sidetrack shareholders with your strategy.
My cards are open for you here. I also read about your near involvement in PATIMAS. But because u were new as the MD to Patimas, you and your other fellow director escaped the fiasco.
As for now I still think u genuinely SINCERE. But your RI is a disappointment. To folk out the 8c RI to 10c RI, I can do it. But I am beginning to feel your insincerity as a Director.

But for the RI, I don't see much benefit to us shareholder compare to Director subscribing to the excess at 0.08 + free warrant without needing to hold any shares.
Once Director subscribe and sell down it, what happen to the share price after that.

That means you also bought fintec shares. Still a long way to RI. At least 6 months from now. Keep your cool. Keep your cards.
Technically, fintec is on the uptrend. Too bad, last few days, trend start to experience profit taking and to make it speed up the profit taking, the RI news. Retailers arent digesting well the RI. Looks like they 9 /10 will vote out the RI."

I am not an insider so whatever i say can only be considered as theory. They wanna raise money thru RI because they wanna suck your money from your wallet. You may say they also need to put in the money themselves. Correct. But the money they are putting in likely to have come from sale of shares via their proxies. So effectively they are not taking any fresh money out of their wallet.
Fintec itself is also just a proxy from their grand scheme. You guys are right to ask why don't they sell some of their holdings & raise money from there so no need to do RI? But what you don't know is they have already cornered the stocks. Hence its easier to push the price up & down to their liking and continue to milk the public as long as there are suckers out there.
If they sell down their shares, 1) they will lose some control of the these companies 2) loosen up the grip of the shares on these companies which they have are cornered.
By doing what they're doing, they will continue to manipulate the share price of these companies, sell some growth stories and lure in new suckers after the old ones have lost patience & sold off. They keep a basket of companies so they can ""rotate"" and take turns to ""fry"" them, make money from suckers so it doesn't look so obvious, and once awhile suck in some fresh money too via RI. Keep doing this for 5-7 years the whole team can retire a multimillionaire.
Its a super smart scheme. If I have their kind of bullets and manpower, i would do the same."

1. PLEASE ANSWER, WHAT IS YOUR LONG TERM INVESTMENT DURATION? 10 YEARS? 20 YEARS?
I HAVE ASKED U BEFORE, AND U KEEP MENTIONING "" FOR LONG TERM INVESTMENT"" WHICH IS ENTIRELY MISLEADING AND U ARE ARE BY YOUR NATURE TO WASTE OUR TIME AND GIVE US HIGH HOPES.
2. WHY SUDDENLY GLOVES BUSINESS AND U ARE STARTING FROM SCRATCH AND HOW LONG IT TAKES FOR U TO HAVE THE BUSINESS REALLY ESTABLISHED??? U DO UNDER ESTIMATE RETAILER'S IQ. WE AREN'T STUPID BY YOUR CALLS FOR GLOVES VENTURE. YOU ARE BLATANTLY PLAYING US WITH YOUR MIND GAMES, MAN!

THE EDGE揭秘─21家仙股股东董事成员或同批人
19/09/2020
权威财经周刊THE EDGE揭露，大马股市过去几个月仙股交投狂热，其中有21家上市公司的股东，董事，很可能是同一批人，这些股票的股价波动幅度惊人，成交量也十分庞大。
这些公司有很多共同点，大多数是亏损公司，股价都是仙股级别，经常占据交易榜前十名，股价的起伏上下惊人。
根据THE EDGE报导，21家被点名的公司中，有9家公司的总部地址，注册地址都相同，即座落在八打灵再也丽阳镇的联和大厦（WISMA LIEN HOE）。
这9家公司包括宜鼎（AT），富科期（FOCUS），万通科技（MTOUCHE），FINTEC环球（FINTEC），XOX说（XOX），M3科技（M3TECH）和NETX科技（NETX）等。
报导指出，联合大厦原本是上市公司联合（LIENHOE）的物业，不过它在2006年以RM1价格，附加4300万令吉债务，脱售给一家私人有限公司E Globafocus有限公司。
EGlobafocus是由CUBES INNOVATIVE有限公司持有68%股权；CUBES INNOVATIVE由两名股东持有99%股权，这两人是商人蔡福顺和温运伦（人名译音）。
蔡氏和温氏曾在2014年7月遭证券监督委员会控以操控上市公司DVM科技股价罪名。
温氏个人在证券监督委员会有多项指控，包括2009年被控滥用上市公司FTEC资源的249万令吉公司资金，自该事件曝光後，温氏就几乎没有在股市活动。
不过，他的两名姐妹温安妮和温秀妮则各别持有另一家仙股公司喜得狼（XDL）的3.64%和0.67%股权。
上述9家公司中，FINTEC环球是最受注目的公司，这家公司的几批股票由一家私人控股公司SANSTON FINACIAL GROUP LTD持有。
诡异的是，SANSTON在21家上市公司的股东名单中都出现。
最近遭收购的海外天（OVERSEA）也在21家公司名单之中。
THE EDGE报导指出，21家公司市值最高的公司是富科斯（FOCUS），市值高达50亿令吉，尽管其季度净利仅有232万令吉，但股价却高得惊人。
随THE EDGE揭秘报导之後，证券监督委员会和大马交易所会不会采取跟进行动，调查这21家公司，颇受市场注目

19/09/2020
The authoritative financial weekly THE EDGE revealed that the Malaysian stock market has been frantically trading in penny stocks in the past few months. Among them, 21 listed companies’ shareholders and directors are likely to be the same group of people. The stock prices of these stocks fluctuate surprisingly and the trading volume is also very high huge.
These companies have many things in common. Most of them are loss-making companies. Their stock prices are at the level of penny stocks. They often occupy the top ten trading lists, and their stock prices fluctuate astonishingly.
According to the report by THE EDGE, 9 of the 21 companies named have the same headquarters address and registered address, which is located in the Wisma Lien House (WISMA LIEN HOE) in Liyang Town, Petaling Jaya.
These 9 companies include Innolux (AT), FOCUS (FOCUS), Wantong Technology (MTOUCHE), FINTEC Global (FINTEC), XOX Say (XOX), M3 Technology (M3TECH) and NETX Technology (NETX).
The report pointed out that Union Building was originally the property of Lienhoe, a listed company, but it was sold to a private limited company, E Globafocus Co., Ltd. in 2006, at a price of RM1 and an additional debt of RM43 million.
EGlobafocus is 68% owned by CUBES INNOVATIVE Co., Ltd.; CUBES INNOVATIVE is 99% owned by two shareholders, businessmen Cai Fushun and Wen Yunlun (names translated).
Chua and Wen were charged by the Securities Regulatory Commission in July 2014 for manipulating the stock price of a listed company DVM Technology.
Wen personally has a number of allegations in the Securities Regulatory Commission, including the RM2.49 million company fund accused of misusing the resources of the listed company FTEC in 2009. Since the incident was exposed, Wen has hardly been active in the stock market.
However, his two sisters Wen Anni and Wen Xiuni each hold 3.64% and 0.67% of the shares in XDL, another fairy stock company.
Among the 9 companies mentioned above, FINTEC Global is the most noticed company. Several batches of shares of this company are held by a private holding company, SANSTON FINACIAL GROUP LTD.
Strangely, SANSTON appears in the shareholder lists of 21 listed companies.
The recently acquired OVERSEA is also on the list of 21 companies.
The Edge report pointed out that the 21 company with the highest market value is FOCUS with a market value of up to 5 billion ringgit. Although its quarterly net profit is only 2.32 million ringgit, its share price is surprisingly high.
Following the report by THE EDGE, whether the Securities Regulatory Commission and Bursa Malaysia will take follow-up actions to investigate these 21 companies has attracted the attention of the market.

报导引述消息指出，这些公司通常拥有相同股东或董事，其股票不但交投炽热，股价波动也很大。报导所列出的21家公司中，有9家公司的营运总部都位于八打灵再也丽阳镇的联和大厦（Menara Lien Hoe）。
这9家公司包括宜鼎系统（AT）、MLABS系统（MLAB）、富科斯（FOCUS）、万通科技（MTOUCHE）、金融科技全球（FINTEC）、XOX说电讯（XOX），M3科技亚洲（M3TECH）和NETX控股（NETX）。Lambo集团（LAMBO）在年报注明的总部位于旧巴生路，但网站注明的营运地址却也位于联和大厦。

AMONG the stellar performers on Bursa Malaysia this year is Focus Dynamics Group Bhd. Year to date, its stock has gained more than 350%, closing at RM2.28 last Friday, translating into a whopping market capitalisation of RM4.66 billion.
This market value is quite an achievement considering that, in the decade from 2009, it has only managed to register net profits in one financial year — in FY2017, when it chalked up RM3.48 million in net profits from RM31.65 million in revenue.
In the first quarter ended March 31 (1QFY2020), the company, whose main business is running food & beverage (F&B) outlets, registered a 21.2% year-on-year increase in net profits to RM748,000 while revenue slipped 6.7% to RM9.30 million. It had cash and bank balances of RM3.7 million and deposits with licensed banks amounting to RM1.95 million. It had little in terms of borrowings, with its interest expense at a mere RM218,819 for the three-month period.

Bonds remain relevant amid uncertain times
As the number of reported Covid-19 cases worldwide breaches the 26 million mark and deaths total close to 900,000 (at the point of writing), the trade-off between economic cost and reducing the spread of the pandemic through lockdowns is starting to weigh on global growth...

Since the company’s flotation exercise on the Mesdaq market of Bursa Malaysia on Feb 10, 2006, Focus Dynamics has yet to pay out any dividends. This is despite its saying at end-November 2017 that it had adopted a policy “to pay an annual dividend of up to 20% of its consolidated profits after tax attributable to owners of the company in respect of any financial year, provided that such distribution will not be detrimental to the company’s cash flow requirements”.
It also added, “The company reserves the discretion to pay [a] higher rate of dividend as it deems appropriate”.
From the date of the flotation exercise to end-April last year, Focus Dynamics’ share price averaged 8.3 sen.
As at end March, its net asset value per share was only around two sen, with its main asset being an entertainment outlet in Menara Lien Hoe in Petaling Jaya.
In early July, when questioned by Bursa Malaysia on the meteoric rise of its share price via an unusual market activity query, Focus Dynamics said, “The group has been continuously on the lookout for opportunities to expand its core business in the F&B segment via mergers and acquisitions to enhance the group’s earnings and improve its financial performance.
“In recent weeks, the group has been in discussions for several opportunities to potentially acquire strategic stakes in F&B companies. In addition, the group is currently in an exploratory stage for a potential merger/acquisition exercise with another company that has a sizeable assets base.
“Notwithstanding the above, the group wishes to highlight that no decision has been made yet with regard to any potential proposal at this juncture as all discussions are still at a preliminary/exploratory stage. The group will make the relevant announcements in accordance with the Listing Requirements in the event of any material development pertaining to the above.”
What is going on?
“Irrational exuberance,” says a seasoned market player on Focus Dynamics’ rise. Another says hidden hands or syndicates — groups that push specific counters up or down — are at work.
Checks with market sources indicate that there are about 20 companies whose share prices appear to have been pushed up by the same group of people. When asked to name some of these counters, one source says, “Just look at the most actively traded on a daily basis … it’s all the same group.”
Nevertheless, there has been a number of developments at Focus Dynamics. For example, it announced a cash call in January 2018, but that has yet to take place with many postponements and several revisions and changes.
In its latest announcement on Aug 18, Focus Dynamics proposed a one-to-three share split, a renounceable rights issue of up to 2.04 billion new irredeemable convertible preference shares (ICPS) with up to 3.07 billion free detachable warrants on the basis of three warrants for every two ICPS subscribed. The proposal is a revision of the previous proposed exercise announced on Jan 9, 2018, it added.
The ICPS have a 10-year tenure and are convertible to new Focus Dynamics shares at a conversion rate of 10-to-one. Both the rights issue and conversion prices will be determined later, although the company has placed an indicative rights issue price of five sen per ICPS.
The free warrants, meanwhile, come with a tenure of five years with the exercise price also to be determined later.

Just as it is hard to explain its price surge, it is equally hard to know the people who control Focus Dynamics as they are hidden behind corporate entities.
Among its largest shareholders is Credit Suisse Group AG, which had 9.95% equity interest as at Aug 18, according to exchange filings. Who Credit Suisse is holding these shares for is unknown. Meanwhile, in its annual report, the list of 30 largest shareholders has very few individual names and comprises mostly merchant banks holding for clients.
Focus Dynamics’ single largest shareholder as at June 1 was Asiabio Capital Sdn Bhd, which had a 25.05% stake. Asiabio is controlled by business incubator and strategy advisory Fintec Global Bhd.
According to Fintec Global’s annual report, its only ultimate substantial shareholder as at June 24, 2019, was Adamas Finance Asia Ltd, holding 5.21%. Meanwhile, on its list of top 30 shareholders, UOB Nominees is named as holding 6.15% for Sanston Financial Group Ltd.
Perhaps this is one case where unmasking may be necessary."

The Edge Malaysia/The Edge Malaysia
September 30, 2020 14:00 pm +08
https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/special-report-hidden-hands-beh...
ASTUTE market observers would have noticed on the local bourse a group of individuals, supposedly acting in concert, who have amassed shares in more than 20 publicly traded companies. These companies — linked via shareholding and directorships — are often on the most actively traded list, with huge, fluctuating share prices.
“It (the companies) is all linked to the same person; usually, the most actively traded list on a daily basis involves these counters,” one source says when asked which are the companies that are linked.
However, research by The Edge (see chart on the 21 companies) indicates that while other businessmen have surfaced, the individual said to be in control of the group of companies is not officially onboard or present as a shareholder.
“This [his not surfacing] could be due to several issues,” another source adds.
It is also telling that nine of the 21 companies mentioned — AT Systemization Bhd, MLabs Systems Bhd, Focus Dynamics Group Bhd, mTouche Technology Bhd, Fintec Global Bhd, XOX Bhd, M3Technologies (Asia) Bhd and NetX Holdings Bhd — have their principal place of business, head office, business office or corporate office in Menara Lien Hoe, near Tropicana Golf Country Resort in Petaling Jaya. On its website, Lambo Group Bhd states that its address is at Menara Lien Hoe, even though the address in its annual report is in Old Klang Road in Kuala Lumpur.
In 2006, Lien Hoe Corp Bhd sold Lien Hoe Tower Sdn Bhd, which owns Menara Lien Hoe, to privately held E-Globalfocus Sdn Bhd for RM1 and the assumption of RM43 million in debts.
Meanwhile, E-Globalfocus was 68%-controlled by Cubes Innovative Sdn Bhd, a company 99%-controlled by Chuah Hock Soon. Chuah and businessman Datuk Kenneth Vun @ Vun Yun Lun were charged with four others in July 2014 for allegedly manipulating DVM Technology Bhd shares in March 2006.
Vun has had several issues with the Securities Commission Malaysia and, in 2009, had to restitute RM2.496 million — being the amount of company funds that he had caused to be misused for his personal benefit, according to the regulator — to his then flagship FTEC Resources Bhd.
Since FTEC — which morphed into Tecasia Bhd and later Mangotone Bhd — was delisted, Vun has had little direct presence in the market. However, Vun’s two sisters, Carol Vun On Nei and Grace Vun Siaw Nei, hold stakes of 3.64% and 0.67% respectively in Xidelang Holdings Ltd.
Fragmented shareholding
While Fintec Global seems to be a prominent company at the centre of the maze, its shareholding is fragmented, with several blocks of shares parked under Sanston Financial Group Ltd. In several of the 21 companies on the list, Sanston Financial is present in the shareholding list.
Other companies that surface as shareholders in these list of companies include Global Prime Partners Ltd and Cita Realiti Sdn Bhd, a private company wholly-owned by one Kamarudin Khalil.
Other shareholders, albeit usually holding small stakes, among the 21 companies include Datuk Jacky Pang Chow Huat — who, apart from a 11.84% stake in Sanichi Technology Bhd — has small stakes in DGB Asia Bhd, Focus Dynamics, MNC Wireless Bhd and Xidelang. Pang is also a director in Sanichi Technology.
Meanwhile, businessman Mak Siew Wei has 23.4% in AT Systemization, 17.07% in Green Ocean Corp Bhd and small stakes in Focus Dynamics and Xidelang. He is also a director at AT Systemization, Green Ocean and Saudee Group Bhd.
Datuk Eddie Chai Woon Chet recently acquired a 62.37% stake in restaurant operator Oversea Enterprise Bhd, and has a 6.71% shareholding in Anzo Holdings Bhd, where he is managing director and has a board position in M3Technologies (Asia). Another name frequently seen is Datuk Kua Khai Shyuan, who, besides a 5.9% stake in mTouche Technology, has small shareholdings in Focus Dynamics, PDZ Holdings Bhd and Sanichi Technology, and has board seats on Trive Property Bhd, DGB Asia and MNC Wireless.
Former Umno treasurer and former Bank Simpanan Nasional Bhd chairman Datuk Abdul Azim Mohd Zabidi surfaces as a director in four of the companies — Fintec Global, DGB Asia, Anzo and XOX.
Most of the companies are loss-making and small in terms of market capitalisation, with the exception of Focus Dynamics, which has a market value exceeding RM5 billion. Nevertheless, Focus Dynamics, which is involved in operating food and beverage outlets, seems to be the star performer, with its stock price hitting a multiple-year high of RM2.64 recently on Sept 17, despite mustering a meagre RM3.08 million in net profit from RM20.72 million in revenue for its six months ended June this year.
Year to date, Focus Dynamics stock has gained about 400%.

a. The company is expected to declare a profit of min of RM500.0 million mainly from the mark to market of their 25% investment in Focus , which has rised from 82 cts as at 30th June 2020 to 2.20 as at 30 Sept 2020. ....they also bought Komark ie about 17.0% at 40cts and the market gain is appro. RM 20.0 million..
b. The NTA of the company is currently around 50cts and with the RM500 plus illion profit , it will balooned to about 80 cts. Their current price is only 11 cts..
c. The rights issue/warrant exercise will be approved on 26th Oct 2020 . They have to block the shares price cap to decide on what price they want to pricee the rights and the exercise price of the warrants. If the exercise price of the warrant is too high, it will not be attractive to the operators.
The price fixing date is expected after 26th Oct and tomrrow is the countdown for the price fixing...i expect the Right/Exercise to be between 6-8 cts , to make this share to fly.
d. they are also venturing into thee Gloves business and the rights is to finance the Glove business.. They also have 20% stake in Komark whih plan to venture into Facce Mask.
e. The rights entitlement and the 3Q result is all expected by 2nd & 3rd week of October, where the action will start.
It for you Guys to decide , if if you believe in itt , buy now and now wheen the shares start moving .....a min of 50.0% profit from this price is attainable witth limited calculated risks, from the exercise which they are undertaking...
Cheers & Good Luck guys ...it your call..."

Anyway read carefully what I wrote and which is duly supported with facts , rather than personal views/ideas etc , maybe lots of guys just pluck from the air ... anyway , you do and really miss out the interesting and important part on this counter which I wish to shares, but since you claim to be the experts , I shall let it be...

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000170.jsp?ftp=461","Oct 19, 2020 7:17 PM","RJ87","During July before aug QR, I estimated Aug QR paper profit 100-150mil.
Now Oct before Nov QR, I estimated Nov QR paper profit 400-500mil.
July pattern is emerging liao. Can't u see?
U see current Oct pattern is like July pattern.
Not surprised if Nov pattern is like Aug pattern. You guys ready for roller coaster?
Likely bounced towards 14sen by end of oct before dropping back to 11sen ish after 2nd week November, before bouncing above 20sen, with 500mil Nov QR on 4th week Nov. Then, I can't predict what will happen after...If they announce dividend, pecahhhhh.... Else, very likely slide all the way back to 8 sen. I'm repeating my playbook. Buy or sell up to u la.
Since when I claim expert? We both share the same opinion on the same facts. U repeated what I have elaborated in July. Scroll back la. That's all i'm saying. jlex11 r carrying the torch. Keep up the good work. (operators are doing the work. So, just take advantage and ride on their effort.)
Just the difference is, up I take profit, down I collect more. Since my entrance was 8sen the first time and manage to lock in profit at 16.5sen. Now I re-enter at with 8.75sen average. Sold half at 10.5sen. If can collect back at 9.5sen, my avg drop to 7.88sen. Basically, how I play also won't lose in this counter.
Always remember to take profit. 10-15% take half the profit. Drop back ur buy price. buy back. Imagine u buy 10sen. Take profit at every 11sen, 1 sen profit. And buy back 10sen if it drops. Do this 10 times, ur first 10sen becomes free. Just alot of work and not many willing to do the work."

U dare to collect RM100K on mahsing C24 last Thursday...now become 400K liao lo...
It's not that long dream la.
Difference between will be those who dares to dream and dares not.
Dare or dare not is a choice buddy. Life are full of choices.
From my observations, chickens are normally the losers. Their strategy is always buy high sell low. Low that time say it's a dream. Weird thing is, go buy when it's high. You will immediately know what i'm talking about when Nov QR is out. 10sens before QR don't want buy. Wait QR out only got buy at 19-20sen. That's the donkey logic u see in our market."

The reason why they do so much RI is to sapu themselves....Then convert, then when materialize RM500mil profit, then pay dividend...then they will make most of the RM500mil, then u idiot is gonna buy their share from them after the RI.
Conclusion. They sapu the dividend. U monkeys gonna buy their share at 30sen. In the end, they keep the dividend and sell at 30sen after they collect 10sen dividend. U clown can understand mer? U clown can't see beyond the corner. When all materialize, u all go buy at 30sen lo.

1) None of the proposal are of my interest. I'm only interested when they going to sell Focus.
2)1mil share in 1.4 billion outstanding shares only 0.07%. I scream yes or no also nobody hear. You ask KYY come la. Buy in 70mil. Then, he sneeze. BOD will pay attention. If he owns controlling share of Fintec, I think first thing he will do is sell everything in Focus. Put 1billion cash into Fintec's balance sheet. He would have turned his 70mil investment to 500-600mil easy. All we need to do is wait ride along.
You poor gamblers come in with contra money who can't wait will keep on losing money.
When 9 sen don't want buy. Because say dunno have to wait how long.
When break out jump 12-15sen, quickly chase. Cos T+2 maybe still go leg. When 17sen, say uptrend don't want sell.
When it dropback to 9sen. Come ask RJ...when is Fintec going to go back up.

And they will take the fall. Stockmarket is a zero sum game. When there is the winner, there must be losers. No such thing as win win here. To mitigate your loses and maximize ur profit, NEVER BUY HIGH OR CHASE ANYTHING.
P.S. Those who chase Mahsing from RM1.10 - 1.46. Now, doing 10-30% lost in few days lo. 67sen that time don't want buy. RM1++ only go chase. It has up by 50+% and as high as 100% liao still buy ar? Hallo! Do you know what's OVERPRICED? If you don't, is it my fault?

KUALA LUMPUR, 28 Okt -- Kilang pengeluaran sarung tangan Talian 1 AT Systematization Bhd (ATS) di Chemor, Perak telah bersedia untuk mengeluarkan kumpulan pertama sarung tangan nitril gred perubatan pada Disember 2020, dengan anggaran jumlah dagangan tahunan RM860 juta daripada penerokaan baharu ini.
Dalam satu kenyataan hari ini, ATS berkata ini mewakili lebih daripada 40 kali berbanding jumlah dagangan tahunan kumpulan sekitar RM20 juta dalam tahun kewangan berakhir 31 Mac, 2020.
Setakat ini, ia berkata kemudahan itu telahpun 80 peratus siap dan pengeluaran akan bermula pada awal Disember, sekali gus membolehkan sumbangan pendapatan daripada perniagaan sarung tangan baharu itu bermula pada tahun semasa kewangan berakhir 2021.
“Dalam setiap bulan berikutnya, dua talian baharu celupan sarung tangan baharu akan dipasang,” katanya.
Menjelang Jun 2021, kumpulan menjangka mencapai kapasiti pengeluaran sarung tangan sebanyak 2.6 bilion keping setahun, berdasarkan kepada andaian 24 jam sehari dan 30 hari sebulan.
Dalam pada itu, kumpulan itu berkata sasaran awal adalah untuk membina enam talian celupan sarung tangan di bawah fasa satu dan enam talian lagi di bawah fasa dua, dan pada masa ini ATS sedang mengusahakan talian ke-13 kerana ia menyaksikan permintaan yang lebih tinggi daripada jangkaan menjelang pengeluaran.
Menurut pengarah urusan ATS, Choong Lee Aun, kumpulan itu akan melabur sejumlah RM120 juta bagi pemasangan 13 talian celupan sarung tangan, berserta kemudahan berkaitan dan bangunan baharu.
“Akhir sekali, ATS merancang untuk mempunyai sejumlah 20 talian celupan sarung tangan, dengan 14 hingga 20 dipasang di kilang baharu yang akan diputuskan kemudian,” tambah beliau.

Stockraider since you like penny stock so much you can look into AT.
AT Systematization Bhd, which is building its glove manufacturing factory in Perak, expects to reach a production capacity of up to 2.6 billion pieces of medical-grade nitrile gloves per annum by June 2021.
The group said each single former production line can run at a speed of 15,000 pieces of gloves per hour, whereas each double former production line can run at a speed of 24,000 pieces of gloves per hour.
Assuming it sustains maximum production capacity throughout and the average selling price of nitrile gloves hits US$80 per 1,000 pieces, AT Systematization believes the new venture will earn the group RM860 million in annual turnover, which is over 40 times the RM20 million achieved in its financial year ended March 31, 2020."

jlex11 Guys , price fixing for the rights/warrant expected this week and if not by next week. Result announcement expected by 25th November 2020 and expected profit not less than RM 500.0 million.
Entitlement date expect before end Nov or early Dec but depending on the Political situation. Expect major price movement soon. 9 cts is a good buy...

Author: Koon Yew Yin | Publish date: Tue, 10 Nov 2020, 3:07 PM
On 29 June the company said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia that it was acquiring glove maker Pearl Glove Sdn Bhd (PGSB) for RM22 million cash.
It said the vendors were Hai Hong Capital Sdn Bhd, P'ng Sim Guan, P'ng Lai Heng, Hai Hong Holdings Sdn Bhd and Aaron Khoo Teng Soon.
The group noted that the immediate outlook for PGSB's existing business as a trusted and tested OEM/ODM manufacturer of safety gloves is extremely positive as the demand for industrial safety gloves increases proportionally with improving workplace and safety practices globally.
On 6 November AT Systematization signed an agreement with LKL International to sell and distribute natural rubber latex and nitrile gloves. It will start production of medical gloves in December.
The gloves would be mainly distributed to hospitals and healthcare providers, with a targeted volume of up to 2.6 billion pieces per year.
LKL managing director Lim Kon Lian said AT Systematization would be able to tap into the former’s extensive distribution network within the healthcare industry, both in Malaysia and internationally.
Comparison
AT Systematization’s total issued shares is 3180 million shares X 19 sen = Rm 605 million market capitalization. It produces 2.6 billion gloves annually. Rm 605 divided by 2.6 billion = 23 sen per glove
Comfort Glove’s total issued shares is 583 million shares X Rm 4.22 = Rm 2.460 billion market capitalization. It produces 5.4 billion gloves annually. Rm 2.46 billion divided by 5.4 billion = 46 sen per glove.
Supermax’s total issued shares is 2.721 billion shares X Rm 8.90 = Rm 24.217 billion market capitalization. It produces 26.6 billion gloves annually. Rm 24.217 billion divided by 26.6 billion = 91 sen per glove.
More medical gloves are required when vaccine is approved by FDA. Medical staff have to wear gloves to inject vaccine as shown in photo below. The world is celebrating Pfizer’s overnight announcement of a viable Covid-19 vaccine.

Now, I'm betting on...Eh BOD, don't la so selfish. Materialize 100mil profit. Pay abit dividend. You don't hv to push fintec. The monkey see balance sheet ada cash 100mil, market cap only 150mil and 0.5sen dividend, they will come push for you. Just 100mil only. Not much. Not much.

else, right listing no one buy. And if they prop the price high high....can consider sell both right listing and Mother share...Ini advice adalah untuk yg hold below 8 sen....when they prop price high high, don't itchy sell first. Wait, after ex date.
Let say ur current average price is 8sen. Operator prop to price until 15sen before ex date.
I think they going to support the price there at 15sen after ex date. Different between mothershare and Right ex price is 7 sen. Ur rights will worth anywhere between 3-7sen.
This way, u get to make 7sen profit and another 3-7sen from selling the right. Then, after RI is exercised. i think will tank all the way down to 6sen. Collect everything back."

E.g. Let say U own 1mil share at 8sen average. They prop the price to 16sen on ex date. Then u sell 500K shares before ex date. Lock in 40K profit. Then subscribe the RI with ur profit for 500K shares and get 500K free warrant. With this move, ur cost to own 1mil share and 400K free warrant is only 40K. Unless after exercise price drop below 4 sen and warrant worth nothing. You just CAN'T lose money. Just saying. =P
Those that didn't buy at 8sen don't come kao beh kao bu here when jalan. 8sen that time u say Scam la. Stupid bod la. When sudah 16sen sudah jalan also say scam la, BOD stupid la. Remember, in the end of the day, you are the only one stupid."

If we see their QR slides, we can see that they are mother of all Goreng counters.... goreng ayam (VSolar), goreng ikan bilis (AT), goreng sotong (Permaju) and any other goreng you name it. But however you put it, they are good at what they do which is why their QR came out superb. Whether you are morally correct to not want to make money from goreng or non-Halal activities (gambling, cigarettes, beer, etc) then stay away but if you think making money from goreng and taking money from this investor to that investor into your own pocket, then, you are in the right place because they are likely to make even bigger money this quarter. How? Just look at how active all the companies in their portfolio at the Bursa. The RI is to squeeze money from investors to shore up their goreng money bag which is why I dont think they will use it for dividend but to use it to goreng even more counters and this is why their business will flourish even more. Consolidation might happen but I think it will not be too soon, because if somehow this counter come out with good results from all their goreng, then, the SP will move up and consolidation will be delayed. Once all these activities slow down (to coincide with no more MCO, EMCO, ABC, etc) and SP starts to drop again, then, we will see consolidation as means to make money..... as always none of us here are members of the BOD, so, we are all just making assumptions at best guess. So, do your own DD starting by looking at their QR reports."

I personally think they will make a ton load of money from the new money they will be getting in from RI which will be their new ammunition for all the counters they are invested in Bursa. Like the above few comments, either you goreng with them when they are goreng-ing their portfolio (which you need to plan and follow very closely and make many many assumptions as none of us are among their whatapps-group of goreng buddies) OR you hope to be spare some leftovers by buying their shares and see them turning good profit every quarter (lazier and less exciting way of making money with them)."

By the way, the ICPS may be converted into new fully-paid Shares at the Conversion Price in the following manner:-
(i) by surrendering 2 ICPS (which are issued at an issue price of RM0.08 each) without additional cash payment to arrive at the Conversion Price of RM0.16 for 1 new Share; or
(ii) by surrendering 1 ICPS (which is issued at an issue price of RM0.08 each) with additional cash payment of RM0.08 to arrive at the Conversion Price of RM0.16 for 1 new Share.
Premised on the terms of the ICPS, subject to adjustments, the ICPS can be converted into new Fintec Shares on any market day commencing on and including the issue date of the ICPS up to and including the maturity date. Any ICPS that are not converted would be mandatorily converted into new Fintec Shares on the maturity date.
If the conversion results in a fractional entitlement to Fintec Shares, such fractional entitlement shall be disregarded and no refund or credit, whether in the form of the ICPS, cash or otherwise, shall be given in respect of the disregarded fractional entitlement.
If the maturity date of the ICPS falls on a non-market day, then it will fall on the preceding market day.
Maturity Date: 04 Dec 2027"

In other words , if the PA is below 8 cts submit 2 PA for conversion and if the PA is above 9 cts , use 1 PA plus cach to top up the diff for the conversion price..

Fintec is NEVER a good fundamental stock. It's a scam stock. It's just a matter of how to benefit from this scam. Now, i'm speculating they going to take our 160mil RI and closed their position in GPA. That's alot of money...which counter they are going to push next...U will hv better luck there.
Operators need to support the price. Queue 10mil to block the drop. Else, RI exercise will fail if there is not enough benefit for people to subscribe.

They will be able to explain and help you manage. From what I have before, you can sell OR on the open market only for a certain time period just like share. Look out for something like Fintec-OR appearing in your portfolio. Price may go up or down like any other shares, you can call it like a very short term warrant. If you didnt sell, it will disappear after the expiry date which will mean you will now have the right to exercise your ”Right”. Another strategy maybe if the ”-OR” goes to ridiculously low price, you can choose to buy more ”-OR” to get more rights to buy. Likewise you can sell a portion of your ”-OR” in the market if the price goes up very much."

Green is because price adjusted in relation of pre RO and Warrant..
Actual close 0.105 cent Monday.....then adjusted to 0.085 on Tuesday
That is 2 cents down.
So that is the reason....it is Green...
my Main question is why adjust to 0.085
i can only thing, the calculation include the OR share calculation as well.
So in fact until OR share is listed....my portfolio showing i am losing money because i bought it at closing price 0.105.
So closing GREEN at adjusted price 0.085 is totally eye washing."

This is only attractive to big kaki with money to buy few million shares as part of syndicate. No ordinary ""investor"" with a right mind will put their money in Fintec. Unless they are ready to swim with sharks. Majority don't.
Like I say in the past, if BOD trying to make get the most shares back without buying expensive. What do u do? This is exactly it. RI another half, existing NOOB shareholder will pass on the RI sell OR and 5sen. With attitude of getting something better than nothing.
Meaning to say before the RI, outstanding shares are BOD50% - Public 50%. BOD wanna buy as much as possible from public without paying premium. How? RI 1:1. Distribution becomes BOD 25%, Public 25% and another 50% RI sold at 8sen. Who do u think will buy most from the 50%?
At the end of the exercise, the BOD will own 75% of fintec and shit load of warrants.
Say if they sold fintec and declare 10sen dividend. Do you know what happen to their 75% ownership and warrant. Market is gonna make them f*cking rich.

Fintec Global Berhad generated strong performance during the six months through to 30th September 2020 as Fintec’s NAV and share price increased 335.19% and 283%6 respectively, compared with the KLCI Index’s total return of 10.97% over the same period. Fintec’s strong absolute outperformance was driven by meteoric rise in positions from Focus Dynamics, Vsolar, AT Systemization and Komark.
Through the end of Fintec’s first half 2020, the group portfolio’s NAV exceeded MYR 1 billion milestone reaching MYR 1.287 billion. The stellar performance can be attributed to investments in Focus Dynamics which saw a gain in excess of MYR 796 million (326.47% return), Komark gaining MYR 31.48 million (494.87% return), AT Systemization gaining MYR 18.97 million(280% return), Vsolar gaining MYR 4.64 million (233% return).
As markets recovery began since late March, Fintec NAV recorded a gain in excess of MYR 890 million while stock prices have appreciated nearly threefold. Investors who purchased Fintec’s stock on 31st of March, 2020 would have been well rewarded as Fintec’s NAV total return since that time has been 335.19% while total shareholder return has been 283%, with the difference due to the widening gap between Fintec’s NAV verses Fintec’s share value. As of 30th September 2020, the gap between Fintec’s NAV verses its share value stands at 10.78 times, representing a significant discount to Fintec’s stock value.
Given the degree of Fintec’s share undervaluation, this represents an attractive entry point for investors to acquire Fintec shares with potential sizable upside as Fintec works to close the gap between its NAV and share value.
Whatever the explanation for Fintec’s large discount, it is Fintec’s view for shares to trade above its net asset value over the long run. To that end, Fintec will implement strategies discussed in the following paragraphs that will be the catalyst to close the gap between Fintec’s NAV and share
value.
First Half FY 2021 Highlights:-
Throughout Fintec’s First Half FY 2021, the group saw progress in the following areas:
1.) Fintec NAV exceeded MYR 1 billion for the first time to MYR 1.287 billion.
2.) Focus Dynamic, a Fintec Investment was added into MSCI Global Small Cap index after gaining 326% during the period.
3.) Fintec’s portfolio trades at a wide spread to intrinsic value with catalysts which we believe should contribute to value recognition. (discuss in detail in Portfolio update)
4.) Fintec’s shares are trades at a 90.72% discount to NAV, which is expect to narrow with improved investment performance.
5.) Continued efforts to form strategic partnerships and deploy capital towards investments to drive shareholder value. E.g. (Brahim holdings Berhad Investment)
MSCI Global Small Index Inclusion Focus Dynamic is now a member of MSCI Global Small Index. The security selection process into MSCI."

Guys , I posted this and someone call me Mat Jenin...let see what happen tomorrow and see who is the Mat Jenin..
Please see my post on the why fintec is a BUY CALL..
Cheers & Good luck...
RJ87 post & comment...
You math salah...u forgot WB can drop is it?
What will happen if Fintec drop to 7 sen, WB become 1sen. And WC maybe 1.5-2sen.
Where can use WB as reference.
Mat Jenin count his eggs because it hatch can prove fatal i tell u.
jlex11 Guys , the WB with a conversion price at 15cts is traded at 3.5cts ...mind you WB is out of the $...The OR W conversion price is 0.08cts and thus the OR W will be valued at what price ...do your maths...
I put to rest my case on Fintec shares till the rights and W are traded to take my profit...

In its circular to share holder on 9 October, page 58 & 59 the conversion price of PA is likely to be adjusted from the current 16 sens to 11 sens. Wait for official announce soon. The implication is, since PA face value is 8 sens (issued price), if conversion is 11 sens, then one PA (8 sen) + 3 sen can be exchanged for one new Fintec share. At the current Fintec price of 11.5 sens, PA price rightfully should be 11.5-3.0=8.5 sens."

azfar8 Initially, i think that it's this counter that will be shine, but however, look at the behaviour these past few days, especially just now, whenever 0.11 become buyer, and the quantity buyer put more than 10 million, but in a blink of eyes, all 10 mil was gone, looks like there are ""somebody"" trying not to move this share price easily, it's frustrating these kind of people exist in a good fundamental stock. I am thinking to just exit this company.
20/11/2020 6:08 PM
******************************************************************************
RJ87 Joke of the day...""good fundamental stock""…
Fintec is NEVER a good fundamental stock. It's a scam stock. It's just a matter of how to benefit from this scam. Now, i'm speculating they going to take our 160mil RI and closed their position in GPA. That's alot of money...which counter they are going to push next...U will hv better luck there.
Operators need to support the price. Queue 10mil to block the drop. Else, RI exercise will fail if there is not enough benefit for people to subscribe.
****************************************************************************
azfar8 A bit disappointed with the trading of fintech today, not because of the price, but there are so many people that are not being thankful and not smart enough to discern info. The -OR reference price 0.035 men, but why did they still throwing kaw-kaw? Doesnt makes sense sometimes how people think, if just thinking your money can buy anything, just switch to your money buy knowledge... buy knowledge on investment...

RJ87 You are disappointment bcos u plan to sell ur OR. You are trying to exit.
Me on the other hand very happy with the market. I'm waiting to buy at 0.5sen. So that I can collect more. My cost becomes 8.5sen 1mil share with 800K warrant. By end of Dec, I should be making next round of money.
If u have the knowledge, u will either not touch this counter at all or, know when to ride along and swim with the sharks.
****************************************************************************
azfar8 Dont write like you know me lah. I know what i am doing. I just express my feeling? I cant express my feeling? This is free forum right? FYI, my entry point not that low, even if i sell all now, i still have profit less the brokerage.

I understand that.
But given their current playbook; share consolidation confirm on their sleeve.
They need to put Fintec in price between above 30sen. else take profit too strong.
U see peoples mentality. 10sen buy in. 12sen take profit. Bila mau sampai 20sen.
U see every morning, operator come set buy queue to support the price also support until dulan.

If you are an investors particulary in fintec, it best that u decide what is good for u especially on whether to subscribe for the OR ..
Please note that the cost to subscribe for the OR is only 8cts and n the event fintec share is above 8cts when the right is listed , your are in the $... made your choice wisely...
The OR- W , that come with the right, in my opinion will be valued for at least 2 cts, taking into consideration the pricing of W in the KLSE as a whole and the pricing of Finttec WA & WB, whereby the exercise price is way above the price of the mother shares... the exercise price of WA is 30 cts & WB is 15cts pre-rights issue , please note...

Scenario: FINTEC
Assume closing price before ex-date = RM0.10
Rights share issue price = RM0.08
Right issue ratio = 5:5
Exercise price of warrants = RM0.08
Free warrants ratio = 4:5
Calculation
= [(closing price before ex-date x 1.0) + (issue price of rights shares x rights issue ratio) + (exercise price of warrants x free warrants ratio)] / (1.0 + rights issue ratio + free warrants ratio)
=[(RM0.10*1.0)+(RM0.08*5/5)+(RM0.08*4/5)] / (1+1+4/5)
= (RM0.10+RM0.08+RM0.064)/2.8

又是老话一句， Fintech 背后的大鲨鱼，不是你们想像那样简单。 Fintech owned Focus share，Foucs 的股价去年到今年最少翻了十几倍（庄家控制价钱），账目上Fintech肯定是赚大钱，可是都是股票益价造成的，不是因为它的业绩弄得好！可以买，见好就收！

Minister Datuk Seri Dr Adham Baba said children born on or after Jan 1, 2020, are eligible for the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), which would be given in three doses — two primary doses at the age of four months and six months, and a PCV booster at 15 months.
However, the pneumococcal immunisation schedule would be adjusted for children whose vaccinations have been delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic this year.
“The administration of the pneumococcal vaccine is the most effective method to prevent pneumococcal bacterial infection and indirectly reduce the resistance to antibiotics. This vaccine is also safe and effective.
The vaccination is vital and quite timely after the number of cases of children with the pneumococcal disease increased from 17,446 in 2017 to 19,773 last year,"" he said after launching the National Pneumococcal Immunisation Programme for Children at a health clinic here, today.
Also present were MoH disease control director Datuk Dr Norhayati Rusli, state Works, Transportation and Health committee chairman Datuk Seri Norol Azali Sulaiman and Pahang health director Datuk Dr Bahari Che Awang Ngah.
The vaccine is intended to prevent bacterial infections of Streptococcus pneumoniae or pneumococcus, which can cause diseases such as pneumonia, sinusitis, middle ear infection (otitis media), meningitis and bacterial infections in the blood (septicemia).
Complications of pneumococcal disease include hearing impairment, brain deformity and death. Children aged five and below are the most at risk of becoming infected and experiencing complications of this disease. Apart from reducing the rate of morbidity and mortality due to related diseases, the vaccination can also reduce treatment costs,” he said.
Dr Adham also said the MoH always ensures that the vaccine used is effective and safe, but parents are urged to report the side effects of the vaccine, if any, to health personnel or through the website at npra.gov.my.
MoH will also deploy the Orang Asli mobile team, mobile bus services, mobile boats and air doctor services to administer the vaccination to children in the rural areas, he added."

I'm quite sure this is the reason why Fintec won't go crazy. Sell, park the cash in the balance sheet. Terus 50sen. But the problem is BOD don't keep any cash in company. But RI instead.
Here's what I think, the moment they get money from RI, they gonna pump Focus, Komark and etc up higher. Then next QR will continue to report profit.

Focus shares was mark to market at RM2.20 in fintec 3Q financial statement. After this split ,the mark to market price is 73cts.
Now is is traded at appro.64 cts or appro. 11 cts loss per each shareholding.
However , the 'expert "" failed to include the ICPS and Warrant from the recent rights issue. The pricing of the the new Focus ICPS and Warrant will and should cover the difference for the mark to market valuation for th period ended 31st December 2020.

Manage ur exposure. Assess you downside risk vs upside reward.
I can tell a good story how u can make alot of money if you do.
At the same time, can potentially LOSE EVEN MORE.
if OR got push up to 3-4sen. I will sell half and exercise half.
My downside risk will absorbed by profits from selling OR. And maybe collect cheaper if it drops to below 6sen after the exercise. That time, really big sorzai if buy PA. hahahahhaa

Apparently, these counters are driven by Market Sentiments / Manipulations rather than Fundamental..Go and find out yourself how much of sales / revenue per month do they secure? RM 200K or RM 200M? If you are ready for this then you are onboard otherwise just stay away and look for other conservative investments. Pls don't risk yourself and it's quite worthy to do a risk assessment before you invest your hard earned money in these counters or other typical counters which are good at manipulating news/media. Frankly i think I am still considered one of the diluted shareholders of AsiaBio (now known as Fintec) based on the amount of invested money against its return. When we are poor, we hope this Robin Hood helps us again in bringing back the price to sky high, Everything is legal now when you are in stock market game.Likewise in politic, it's dirty, cruel, and etc. So what now? Just learn how to become a Smart Investor. Go and learn from a Smart Sifu not a Smart Scammer."

BENGALURU (Dec 3): Emerging Asian currencies and stocks broadly firmed on Thursday, as news that Britain would start vaccinating citizens against the coronavirus next week fanned hopes of a swift global economic rebound next year as the pandemic subsides.
Signs of progress in U.S. stimulus talks overnight also supported risk appetite and investors shunned the U.S. dollar in favour of currencies with higher yields and other emerging market assets.
Britain on Wednesday became the first western country to approve Pfizer Inc's COVID-19 vaccine, with its chief executive confident that vaccine supply would outpace demand by the end of 2021.
""Vaccines have provided a shot in the arm for sentiment thanks to the improving likelihood of a faster and more robust growth recovery,"" Societe Generale analysts said in a report.
Malaysian stocks jumped 0.9% to lead gains in Southeast Asia, while shares in South Korea and Singapore also rose.
Indonesian stocks hit a more than nine-month high, but later gave up gains to trade lower after the country's president said he hoped the central bank would take on ""a more significant role"" in upcoming reforms.
Proposals made in recent months to expand Bank Indonesia's mandate have irked investors and analysts and raised doubts about the central bank's independence.
Most regional currencies traded higher as the dollar continued to plumb a near two-and-a-half year low.
The greenback has been sold-off since last month as market participants pile into riskier holdings amid positive vaccine news and hopes of further stimulus support, and analysts at Goldman Sachs contend this trend may continue.
""An integral part of our negative dollar outlook for 2021 is that vaccine development and distribution will lead to coordinated global growth, helping to catalyze portfolio outflows from the U.S. into other markets,"" they said.
""Portfolio flows to more pro-growth sectors, particularly in China and other emerging markets, are likely a key factor behind the dollar's recent depreciation, and we expect that to continue.""
Philippine stocks added 0.6% after data showed the country's unemployment rate eased in October as coronavirus curbs were gradually lifted, while Thai shares <.SETI > bounced 0.4%.
Thai officials on Wednesday announced plans for 43.5 billion baht ($1.44 billion) of additional stimulus to try to boost domestic consumption and revive the tourism-reliant economy, even as global infections continue to rise.
Thailand also faces risk from continued political uncertainty and anti-government protests, which have been raging for months.
""The protests do not bode well for an already-contracting economy. We see political tensions mounting and lasting into 2021, with no clear solution in sight at this juncture,"" said Tim Leelahaphan, an economist at Standard Chartered."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000170.jsp?ftp=488","Dec 3, 2020 10:35 PM","roshazli","DPDHL says it is ready to transport Covid-19 vaccines
KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 3): Deutsche Post DHL Group (DPDHL), the German multinational package delivery company, says it is ready to transport Covid-19 vaccines.
We have been working on the movement on the vaccine for two to three months in hyper care,” DHL Express CEO John Pearson said in a virtual press conference today.
The press conference was held in conjunction with the release by DPDHL, together with NYU Stern School of Business, of the DHL Global Connectedness Index 2020: State of globalisation in times of Covid-19 Organizational.
The report is the first comprehensive assessment of globalisation during the spreading of the pandemic.
Pearson said DPDHL has produced a white paper in cooperation with McKinsey and has been getting it on the desks of health ministries, governments, life science and healthcare companies, as well as firms involved in the ancillary world of vaccines.
The movement on vaccines via express is right in our wheelhouse,” he Pearson, noting that DPDHL’s supply chain footprint capabilities — which includes mail, parcel, express, air freight, sea freight and all forms of warehousing — “is a typical supply chain at its greatest”.
We got the time in our transit time parameters to deliver that from anywhere to anywhere,” he said.
Pearson explained that the transit time in any sort of shipment, in any normal day, to any of the 221 countries DPDHL serves, is between one and five days.
Pfizer has developed a shipping container that can maintain the required -70° C for up to 10 days unopened.
Thus, Pearson said, this will give the group a leeway of five days to deliver the vaccines."

but is a bad company now, harta also same.
if you buy in now , may lose money when gloves demand drop!
Fintec was a good compny before, if you bought in 6
month or one year ago , will make money as good as top glove.
BUT fintec is a good company now also WHY???
if gloves demand drop and gloves production start mid 2021, you consider bad luck , price wont up to $2
but only up to 0.20only .you only make 100%.
target to make 1000% to $2.
RISK IS ALWAYS HAVE IN SHARE MARKET.
your risk is target make 1000% drop to 100%

For WB even if the new conversion price for both WB and PA is 12 sens, one need to take out 12 sens plus one WB to get one Fintec share.
For example at this moment Fintec is 10.5 sens, WB is 4.5 sens, PA is 5.5 sens. To convert WB to Fintec the cost is (4.5+12)=16.5 sens. To convert PA to Fintec, since PA has a base value of 8 sens and is conversion is 12 sens, one needs to take out another 4 sens, so if the price of PA now is 5.5 sens, the cost of converting PA to Fintec is (5.5+4)=9.5 sens instead of 16.5 sens for WB.
Please note that WB will be expired on 12/4/2022 and is out of many now when Fintec is at 10.5 sens whereas PA will expire only on 4/12/2027 and has a base value of 8 sens."

I shall cut and paste what I have written in my previous comment on 7/12/2020 at 9.34am : ""To convert PA to Fintec, since PA has a base value of 8 sens and if conversion is 12 sens, one needs to take out another 4 sens, so if the price of PA now is 5.5 sens, the cost of converting PA to Fintec is (5.5+4)=9.5 sens instead of 16.5 sens for WB.""
The above is just to illustrate a point why PA is better than WB, I assumed a revised new conversion price of say 12 sens. Since PA has a base value of 8 sens (please note:WB has no base value), the difference between conversion price (assumed) of 12 sens and the base value of PA of 8 sens = (12-8) = 4 sens, so instead of buying a Fintec at 10.5 sens, you can buy a PA at 5.5 sens then add in another 4 sens to convert to one Fintec share. The cost is only 5.5+4=9.5 sens. If you buy a WB to convert, your WB price say 4 sens + 12 sens conversion =16 sens. The main difference is PA is an ICPS which is Irredeemable Convertible Preference Share that has a base value of 8 sens. That is why before the Ex-Right Issue date when conversion price was 16 sens, you can use 2xPA (2x8 sens) for conversion into 1xFintec."

Conversion price isn't ur biggest assumption. Your BIGGEST ASSUMPTION is that the price to convert 1PA shares to 1Fintec share is by doing this (12sen - 8 sen) = 4sen. Based on YOUR TWISTED ASSUMPTION, If conversion price is 10 sens and the base value of PA of 8 sens = (10-8) = 2 sens, ur calculation becomes (5.5sens + 2 sen = 7.5 sens) for 1 fintec share.

It's not market not efficient. it's more like people like you don't know how to count.
Initial conversion price is 16sen. Either 2 X PA = 16sen or 1 PA + 8sen CASH = 16sen for 1 Fintec share.
Now that you adjust 16 sen to 11 sen. Making 2 X PA = 11sen or 1PA + 5.5sen CASH = 11sen.
So if in future Fintec share trades at 14.5sen, PA should trade at (14.5sen - 5.5sen) at 9sen. 9sen/6sen investment gives handsome 50% return. But if really Fintec Trades at 14.5sen and u exercise ur RI at 8sen. 14.5sen/8sen gives and even more handsome 81.25% alone not counting profit from WC.
Do I hv to spell this out to u jlex when I say PA is rubbish if compared to Mother share for RI, OR for RI that time? But you could be right where the return from PA will surpass return from RI, only when Fintec trades above 30sen. But PA return can never beat return from RI+free WC combined."

TOPLINE The experimental vaccine developed by China National Pharmaceutical Group, also known as Sinopharm, is 86% effective at preventing Covid-19 infection and 100% effective at preventing severe and moderate disease, health officials from the United Arab Emirates announced Wednesday, although with scarce detail provided about the trial.
The UAE health ministry cited an interim analysis of a late-stage clinical trial involving 31,000 volunteers as the source of its information, though neither they nor Sinopharm provided any data from the trial to validate the claims such as how many participants were infected or how many actually received the vaccine.
The ministry said “no serious safety concerns” were observed, though, again, no information on side effects was provided.
The ministry said the announcement is a “significant vote of confidence by the UAE’s health authorities in the safety and efficacy of this vaccine.”
The ministry added that it had officially registered the vaccine at the request of the manufacturer, which it says could eventually lead to the shot’s widespread authorization.

That time Fintec 14sen, PA is 6sen. Fintec up 2sen to 16sen. PA becomes 8 sen. 33% return on PA while mother only return 14%.
They change the conversion price to 11sen. Meaning 1PA + 5.5sen =11sen. (U must be asking, where the hell do I get 5.5 sen. 2 PA for 1 Fintec share will applies. Meaning 2 PA 5.5 = 1 Fintec conversion price at 11sen. This rule still applies. It's written there.)
if Fintec 11sen, PA should be 5.5sen. if Fintec up to 13 sen. PA should be 7.5 sen. The return becomes 45sen if compared to 33% in earlier example.

1) 2 X PA (8sen) = 16sen
or
2) 1 X PA (8sen) + 8sen cash = 16sen.
Last time, u need to top up 8sen to convert 1 PA to 1 Fintec.
Now conversion price adjusted to 11sen from 16sen. Meaning
1) 2 X PA (5.5sen) = 11sen
or
2) 1 PA (5.5sen) + 5.5sen cash = 11sen.
I have 2 problems with Chankyew50 exercise
1) 1.375 X 1PA (8sen) = 11sen instead of original conversion method 2 X PA (5.5sen) = 11sen,
or
2) 1 X PA (8sen) + 3sen cash = 11sen instead of original conversion method 1 PA (5.5sen) + 5.5sen = 11sen.
Now that conversion price determines the base value of PA. My conversion method is consistent with the adjusted conversion price. How the hell this guy have adjusted conversion price without adjusting the PA base value? I guess just because he likes it looooo. This is where I say Chankyew50 deCasino.
okla, for those that already buy in...die die also wanna believe whatever suits u can go ahead. U might as well believe 1PA = 1 Fintec. Great discount now. Go buy. =D"

BEIJING/TOKYO/SEOUL/MANILA/TAIPEI/JAKARTA/DHAKA/HANOI (Dec 11): Trial data from Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc and AstraZeneca Plc has shown their experimental vaccines are effective in preventing novel coronavirus infection.
While regulatory processes are underway, few Asian countries expect to receive significant amounts of the vaccines initially. Here are estimated distribution time lines, supply deals announced and clinical trials being held in the region.
Australia
The country has secured around 140 million doses: 53.8 million from AstraZeneca, 51 million from Novavax Inc, 10 million from Pfizer, and 25.5 million from distribution programme COVAX.
It expects delivery of 3.8 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine in January and February next year and plans to begin inoculations in March.
China
China has not announced supply deals with Western drugmakers, which instead have partnered with private companies in the country.AstraZeneca's vaccine may be approved in China by mid-2021 and its Chinese partner Shenzhen Kangtai Biological Products Co Ltd plans annual production capacity of at least 100 million doses by the end of this year.
For the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, a unit of Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd plans a Phase II trial.
Tibet Rhodiola Pharmaceutical Holding Co is bringing in Russian vaccine candidate Sputnik V and plans early and mid-stage trials in China.
China has also approved three vaccine candidates developed by Sinovac Biotech Ltd and state-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) for emergency use, and Sinopharm hopes its two candidates will get conditional approval for general use this year.
Japan
Japan has deals to buy 120 million doses from Pfizer/BioNTech in the first half of next year and 120 million from AstraZeneca - the first 30 million of which will be shipped by March 2021 - and 250 million from Novavax.
It is also in talks with Johnson & Johnson and has a deal with Shionogi & Co Ltd.
Experts said vaccine makers would need to conduct at least Phase I and II trials in Japan before seeking approval for use.
South Korea
The country has deals to buy 20 million doses each from AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna and another 4 million doses from Johnson & Johnson's Janssen, enough to cover up to 34 million people.It will procure additional doses for 10 million people through COVAX.Inoculation is likely to start in the second quarter of next year to allow time to observe possible side effects.
India
The head of the Serum Institute of India, which makes the AstraZeneca vaccine, said on Nov. 23 the positive late-state trial result of the candidate will allow it to seek emergency use approval by year-end, before securing approval for full introduction by February or March.
India also expects a government-backed vaccine to be launched as early as February. It is also conducting a late-stage trial of Sputnik V.
Taiwan
Taiwan aims to secure around 15 million doses initially, both via the COVAX scheme and by direct purchases from manufacturers, and may buy an additional 15 million doses.
The government has said it hopes to begin vaccinations in the first quarter next year.
Malaysia
The Southeast Asian nation has agreed to buy 12.8 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, becoming the first country in the region to announce a deal with the U.S. drugmaker after some expressed reservations over the need for the ultra-cold storage that the vaccine requires.
Pfizer will deliver the first batch of 1 million doses in the first quarter of next year.
The Philippines
The archipelago announced a deal on Nov. 27 for 2.6 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and is discussing a possible 1 million more, covering about 1% of a population of 108 million people.It is also seeking 20 million to 50 million doses from Sinovac and is in talks with others, including Pfizer.Vaccine makers can seek approval from Philippine regulators even if no clinical trial is conducted in the country.
Indonesia
Southeast Asia's most populous country has secured 125.5 million doses from Sinovac, 30 million from Novavax, is in talks with AstraZeneca and Pfizer to buy 50 million doses each, and expects to get 16 million from COVAX.Indonesia is testing Sinovac's vaccine and preparing mass vaccination for medical staff and other frontline workers to start as soon as late January.
Vietnam
A government official said COVAX vaccines would cover only 20% of the population and the country is likely to have a chance to secure separate deals soon, as demand is very high.
Bangladesh
Bangladesh signed a deal with India's Serum Institute to buy 30 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.It also expects to receive 68 million doses from global vaccine alliance GAVI at a subsidised rate, a senior health ministry official said."

EveryOne who buy need Angpow money for 2021.
Everyone who buy at 0.08 cent thought it is a good deal.
RI sold max how many cent..0.02 right whereas it suppose to be 0.0325.
Weak demand lo obviously.
Only force to take up RI because no choice...cannot sell at 0.0325
Let do simple math...
a day before ex Date.....buy at 0.105
next day after ex date....adjust to 0.085 after taking RI into consideration.
So your actual average price will be
0.105 + 0.08 ( after take up RI )

Go check current Fintec WA and Fintec WB.
it is 0.04 to 0.045 lo.
Fintec actually is forcing investor who have RI to ""donate"" 0.08 to their coffer ...
Currently tradable share for Fintect is about 2.8 billion..
If RI is fully subcribed, then it will be almost 5.6 billion.
So on 28 Dec.....you think Fintec will push up the share, or sell off?
Important for Fintec, every RI at 0.08 cent is forcing you investor to come out extra fund to buy."

Smarter ones use proceeds to subscribe EXCESS Rights. Like you mentioned, more than 2billion options, which requires Rm 160 million at least.
So some investors sold and lessen risk while booking future profit through the warrant. Even at 2-3 cents, it’s good money.

最新报告惊喜非Fintec莫属。很多人觉得公司赚700M是很好的一间公司。可是赚那么多钱干嘛还会找股东要钱？公司不可以卖掉一些投资吗？就好像你跟朋友说你在股市赚了700M可是我可以跟你借钱吗？你朋友会说什么呢。

Champ Hank 疫情期间很多公司亏到一塌糊涂要倒闭，bursa 和 sc 为了不给公司倒闭造成失业率飙高就已经放松不用什么条件让企业可以简单融资，发行股票可以去到增加50%。这些烂公司上市到现在没有可行稳定赚钱的业务，难道他们不会经营生意？
人啊不用我说..平时勤劳不勤劳管理公司有心没心想做不想做罢了！他们都是有钱花不完享受生活做工一条虫过生活一条龙在讲公司几乎都是大众的钱也是大众投的钱都不是老板的自己钱，他们肯定都是在混日子所以公司上市以来几乎年年都亏钱平时年年都集资，你们的钱一部分拿去填洞维持正常运作一部分又拿去做可以不可以行不行的业务然后顺便ang gong 一些进老板口袋。现在放松监管有用到钱没用到钱他们哪里会错过这次机会肯定火力全开集资。

为何大股东只有不到3%你不好好奇啊？
难道你没好奇心？
你说奇怪不奇怪？
剧情是有很多集的有些是制片导演不想给你看到知道的剧情。
他葫芦里卖的是什么药难道你不懂？
剧情我早就懂我不能在FB 说。

你是fintec 的幕后主谋公司有账面赚接近10亿，focus都不值钱只值几千万卖掉9亿多就是fintec 的了！
为何他没卖？你不好奇啊？哈哈哈
你是fintec 的幕后主谋你会卖掉focus吗?
卖掉focus 整10亿肯定钱就进fintec了的喔....9亿多的钱 派股息那么就是97%的投资人所拥有，大股东拿不到3千万！你们就慢慢等啦...,想的的美哦......幕后主谋完全一角钱都拿不到....你说呢？
幕后主谋根本不打算卖。只给你看到很爽很爽根本不打算请你吃！

又是老话一句， Fintech 背后的大鲨鱼，不是你们想像那样简单。 Fintech owned Focus share，Foucs 的股价去年到今年最少翻了十几倍（庄家控制价钱），账目上Fintech肯定是赚大钱，可是都是股票益价造成的，不是因为它的业绩弄得好！可以买，见好就收！

Fintec said it received a notice in writing dated Dec 21 from PKF, with the auditor's term of office to end 21 days after the date.
PKF was reappointed as the auditors of the company at the last annual general meeting (AGM) of the company held on Sept 30, and is to hold office until the conclusion of the next AGM of the company.
The resignation of PKF is on a voluntary basis due to its resources constraint,"" said Fintec in a filing with Bursa Malaysia.
Otherwise, the group said its board is not aware of any other matters that need to be brought to the attention of Fintec's shareholders.
Fintec said further announcements will be made by the company in due course, once it finalises the appointment of a new auditor.
There have been several announcements by listed companies of auditor resignations in recent days.
Last Friday, DGB Asia Bhd, INIX Technologies Holdings Bhd and SMTrack Bhd announced the resignation of Jamal, Amin & Partners as their auditor on the same day.
DGB attributed the resignation to ""manpower issues"", while SMTrack said the resignation was on a ""voluntary basis"". INIX did not give a specific reason for the resignation."

1. Assuming market collapse and all shares drop by 50% , it still should be traded at least 24 cts ( 8 + 37/2)
2. If the above shares becom zero value , fintec NTA is still around 8cts..
Sanity wiill prevail and patience on this counter will bear fruit within the coming months espp during the CNY rally , if any..
Cheers and think ......
Fintec market value RM231m. For that we get :-
RI cash = RM114m
Cash from sale of Focus WD = RM26.743m
421.6m AT @0.20 = RM84.32
Total = RM225m

oops...I forgot to mention the holdings in MLab-WC and the valuation of the glove venture.

最新报告惊喜非Fintec莫属。很多人觉得公司赚700M是很好的一间公司。可是赚那么多钱干嘛还会找股东要钱？公司不可以卖掉一些投资吗？就好像你跟朋友说你在股市赚了700M可是我可以跟你借钱吗？你朋友会说什么呢。

Champ Hank 疫情期间很多公司亏到一塌糊涂要倒闭，bursa 和 sc 为了不给公司倒闭造成失业率飙高就已经放松不用什么条件让企业可以简单融资，发行股票可以去到增加50%。这些烂公司上市到现在没有可行稳定赚钱的业务，难道他们不会经营生意？
人啊不用我说..平时勤劳不勤劳管理公司有心没心想做不想做罢了！他们都是有钱花不完享受生活做工一条虫过生活一条龙在讲公司几乎都是大众的钱也是大众投的钱都不是老板的自己钱，他们肯定都是在混日子所以公司上市以来几乎年年都亏钱平时年年都集资，你们的钱一部分拿去填洞维持正常运作一部分又拿去做可以不可以行不行的业务然后顺便ang gong 一些进老板口袋。现在放松监管有用到钱没用到钱他们哪里会错过这次机会肯定火力全开集资。

又是老话一句， Fintech 背后的大鲨鱼，不是你们想像那样简单。 Fintech owned Focus share，Foucs 的股价去年到今年最少翻了十几倍（庄家控制价钱），账目上Fintech肯定是赚大钱，可是都是股票益价造成的，不是因为它的业绩弄得好！可以买，见好就收！

However, they have got it right this time from the investment from the various cash calls which they made & it is bearing fruits now.
With the additional RI they are in a good position to pursue their next business plan ...additional the company has very little borrowing, one red flag for financial predicaments.
Their current price is at the lower end and once the weak shareholders from the current RIs are being flush out and new investors taking position in the company considering the business potential of the company, a firmer shareholder base will emerge for the upswing in price appreciation..
WC at 3 cts , at an exercise price at 8cts and with 3 years remaining tenor is a bargain buy especially the mother shares still hover around at 8 -8.5cts....it is still in the money...Last Chance Wagon...

No common group of companies in Malaysia can do such a feat. I believe the Auditors do not simply approved and verified such 2020 Audited Financial Reports. Doing such is against the rules set by the MIA and all the relevant Authorities. But I do understand investing into Quoted and Open Market Securities do have risks but such risks are subject to the rise and fall of each individual shares and portfolio. The Auditors and their Accountants are using the fair value accounting to report the profits. Fair value accounting do not cause the financial crisis (if any), but the crisis may have been aggravated by common mis-perceptions about fair value accounting standards. If we can make these accounting complexities clearer by adopting a dual dimensional approach using one fair value accounting and one historical cost accounting to our financial reporting, then both companies and stakeholders are then be better equipped to respond intelligently whenever any financial markets are next thrown into turmoil again and again and again. Based on my observations on the latest Qtr Report of Fintec, I know this risk and I fully accept what the investing public think about Fintec at the moment. Investing in Fintec now at 8 sen is the lowest if compared to what Fintec has reported such a huge profit. I believe one day Fintec would make a big dividend payout and the investing public will be awed. I invest in Fintec around 2 to 4 million shares only. Do not want to go in too deep, afraid the public fear may be correct because even the Directors of Fintec do not own any substantial shares. This is my only worry about Fintec. Do invest into Fintec and do not go in too deep. That's my advice."

You must see the reason why they changed Auditors. See below link.
AOB ACTS AGAINST AUDITORS
19 October 2018 | Kuala Lumpur
The Securities Commission Malaysia’s Audit Oversight Board (AOB) fined Siew Boon Yeong & Associates and its Managing partner Dato’ Siew Boon Yeong RM227,000 and RM81,000 respectively for failing to comply with the requirements of the approved standards on auditing in Malaysia. The AOB also prohibited the firm and Siew from auditing the financial statements of a public interest entity (PIE) and schedule fund for nine months.
In addition, AOB prohibited a former partner of Siew Boon Yeong & Associates, Lim Teik Ee, from auditing the financial statements of any PIE for nine months after he was found to have failed to carry out his role as an Engagement Quality Control Reviewer (EQCR) for three public listed companies effectively. The EQCR plays an important role in the quality control process of an audit and is key to safeguarding audit quality. This is the first time the AOB has taken enforcement action against an auditor who was an EQCR."

This company is stuck in a trading range of $0.05-$0.06 for months. If Executive Directors are substantial shareholders in a stroke of pen will effectively reduce the free float and easier for the share value to appreciate. As you have said Fintec shareholders may be faced with a similar problem compounded by the fact that the NSOH is 2.8B which is very large .

Turkey Of The Year: The rally in penny stocks and their subsequent plunge
TheEdge Tue, Jan 05, 2021 03:30pm - 4 days ago
IN September this year, The Edge ran a piece titled “Hidden hands behind penny stock surge”, which showed the relationship between 21 companies, all connected via similar shareholders and/or directors and all exhibiting unusual peaks and troughs, jolting share prices for no apparent reason.
Behind these companies is an individual or a small group of individuals controlling things and making a mockery of corporate governance standards.
Interestingly enough, it is understood that there are about 40 companies controlled by the hidden hands.
At the apex of the maze of companies is Fintec Global Bhd, a company that does not have a core business except to act as an incubator. On Fintec’s website, it says, “The name ‘Fintec’ mirrors our motto of ‘financials before technology’, that is, we first and foremost look to the existing and/or potential financial performances of the companies in need of capital injections before all other merits such as technology, business nature and business plan are considered.”
According to its annual report, it has investments in start-ups but it is worth noting that Fintec also invests in several small-cap, publicly traded companies.
Companies under Fintec’s belt include Saudee Group Bhd (21.55%), AT Systematization Bhd (28.29%) and Focus Dynamics Group Bhd (25.04%). There are also companies such as Green Ocean Corp Bhd and Trive Property Group Bhd, in which Fintec has indirect stakes via Saudee Group and AT Systematization. It is also noteworthy that at end-November, Fintec ceased to be a substantial shareholder of NetX Holdings Bhd.
Some of these companies, such as Fintec and AT Systematization, were in the news for announcing new ventures, including into glove making. It remains to be seen whether they are successful in these ventures.
Nevertheless, Fintec’s “jewel in the crown” is Focus Dynamics, which operates seven food and beverage outlets. It mustered a net profit of RM7.26 million from RM42.88 million in revenue for the nine months ended September this year. Despite having accumulated losses of RM40.26 million, Focus Dynamics at the time of writing was trading at 65 sen, giving the company a market capitalisation of almost RM4 billion, and was listed on the MSCI global small-cap indices last month.
Whether such a high market value is justified for a company that raked in RM7 million in net profits is questionable. So far this year, Focus Dynamics’ share price has shot up more than 390% from 13 sen as at end-2019, with no apparent reason for the meteoric rise.
Just prior to this article, Fintec pocketed RM26.74 million in cash, selling 768.15 million of Focus Dynamic’s warrants on the open market.
This year alone, Fintec has completed two share placements and one rights issue with free warrants, raising RM182.6 million. Note that as a reprieve to companies hit by the pandemic, Bursa Malaysia relaxed the rules on private placements, allowing listed companies to place out not more than 20% of the total issued shares, from the existing 10%, until Dec 31, 2021 — subject to shareholders’ approval.
Most of the companies in which Fintec invests are loss-making and small in terms of market capitalisation, and seem to lack a clear business direction or strategy.
Other stocks (besides Focus Dynamics) that have shown simi­lar gains but plummeted include loss-making Anzo Holdings Bhd, a company dealing in timber products that gained more than 1,000% from mid-May to hit a high of 26 sen in July. It closed at 8.5 sen on Dec 23, losing 67% from the peak.
PDZ Holdings Bhd, an ailing shipping company, was trading at one sen in mid-March but, at end-June, it gained more than 500% to reach its peak of 32.5 sen this year — a remarkable feat, considering it is mired in lawsuits and has no significant shipping assets. Closing at 7.5 sen on Dec 23, it is down 77% from the peak.
Meanwhile, loss-making XOX Bhd, which is involved in cellular telecommunication services, gained more than 430% from mid-July to hit a high of 39.5 sen at end-August. In mid-March, XOX was trading at one sen.
Anzo, PDZ and XOX are linked to Fintec via its directors. All three companies have announced corporate exercises, including placements of shares and rights issues.
Meanwhile, Saudee Group’s stock hit a low of eight sen on March 17, but picked up momentum in June to hit a 52-week high of 67 sen on Aug 13, gaining more than 300%. It closed at 50 sen on Dec 23 — down 25% from the peak.
While there is reason to believe that the regulators are indeed looking into the companies and their erratic share price movements, and that the authorities have actually commenced investigations, it is unclear whether there will be any follow-up action aside from an unusual market activity (UMA) query by the exchange.
Also worth noting is that investigation"

TheEdge Tue, Jan 05, 2021 03:00pm - 4 days ago
IF 2020 is the year of rubber glove manufacturers and technology-related counters, penny stocks deserve at least a notable mention.
The penny stock fever on the local bourse has not been seen for at least 20 years since the dotcom bubble burst.
The eye-popping share price rally lured long-absent retail investors to the stock market and that, in turn, lifted the daily trading volume to a record high of 27.8 billion shares on Aug 11.
At the height of the penny stock fever in August, share prices hitting limit up were not a rare sight. On Aug 7, 12 stocks hit limit up, including HLT Global Bhd, LKL International Bhd and ES Ceramics Technology Bhd. These three were below 20 at the start of 2020.
Most of these stocks were boosted by announcements on plans to diversify into personal protection equipment (PPE), mainly disposable rubber gloves or face masks, or that a memorandum of understanding had been signed with foreign pharmaceutical companies for the exclusive right to distribute a Covid-19 vaccine, although the government has yet to decide whether the private sector would be involved.
Some describe the Covid-19 pandemic as a blessing in disguise as retail investors had extra money in their pockets to invest as a result of the six-month loan moratorium granted by the banks, while the unprecedented global demand for PPE gave rise to wild expectations on the earnings potential of an investment in producing rubber gloves or raw materials such as nitrile.
Fintec Global Bhd’s elevated quarterly profits may help explain the market euphoria. The company, which owns stakes in several listed entities, reported a 905% year-on-year surge in net profit for the second quarter of its financial year ended Sept 30 (2QFY2021) to RM720.5 million, from RM71.7 million in the previous corresponding quarter.
Almost all of its business segments — green technology, oil and gas (O&G) and trading — posted pre-tax losses during the quarter, with the exception of its portfolio investment division.
Fintec recorded a “fair value gain on investment securities” of RM714.2 million — nearly 10 times the RM73.6 million it recorded a year earlier in 2QFY2020. On its balance sheet as at Sept 30, 2020, it had RM1.23 billion in investment securities, almost four times the RM358.1 million recorded six months earlier on March 31.
Fintec did not reveal the details of the investment portfolio as it is not required under Bursa Malaysia’s listing rules. However, based on the disclosure of companies’ shareholdings through its wholly-owned subsidiary Asiabio Capital Sdn Bhd, Fintec holds shares in Saudee Group Bhd, VSolar Group Bhd, Komarkcorp Bhd, Focus Dynamics Group Bhd, Seacera Group Bhd and AT Systematization Bhd — all penny stocks. In a nutshell, the large gains were due to the surge in the market values of its investments.
When sentiment was especially buoyant, even the share prices of bus operators Gets Global Bhd and Konsortium Transnasional Bhd — both of which have been loss-making for years — could more than double in a single day, with the daily trading volume exceeding their issued share capital. This means a portion of the companies’ shares changed hands more than once on a single trading day.
Gets Global is an outperformer among the penny stocks in terms of share price performance. The stock exchange queried the company on unusual market activity three times between August and November due to the steep climb in its share price, but this did not stop its spectacular rise. It may seem unbelievable that Gets Global’s share price skyrocketed from 10 sen to RM3.97 in less than four months.
The counter’s rally gained strength when it announced a rubber glove manufacturing venture. On top of that, two new substantial shareholders — ADA Capital Investments Ltd and Teong Lian Aik — emerged in the company after a share placement. ADA Capital is owned by Teong’s brother-in-law, Low Bok Tek.
AT Systematization, which has also ventured into the rubber glove manufacturing business, also stands out among the penny stocks. It is likely the most traded stock of 2020. Daily trading volume soared to 2.66 billion shares on Nov 10, accounting for 23% of the total volume of shares traded on Bursa Malaysia that day.
In the second week of November, AT Systematization’s weekly trading volume swelled to 10.85 billion shares, which was equivalent to slightly more than 16% of the total weekly volume on the stock exchange. This was the first time that many investors had witnessed such a large trading volume on a single stock."

jlex11. I believe this Fintec is controlled by a group of nominees behind the door. No need to be so transparent. I believe Fintec can do it after all where can you find companies or public entities in Malaysia that can make so much money in a short time. Buy into Fintec at 8 sen now for your Returns as well as their Returns can be very huge."

No point writing in VC forum when cannot have intellectual discussion. Only useless span in VC whereas in Fintec forum there are investors who I can have a meaningful dialogue. The problem shared by both VC & Fintec is that there are too much free float which makes it difficult for price appreciation. As pointed out by many investors in Fintec forum directors are not substantial shareholders. VC likewise also have a similar issue. Since VC directors are not willing to become substantial shareholders again have opted for share consolidation to reduce the NSOH. Fintec may also follow a similar path as what they did back in 2017. This may be a good move as it will reduce the number of weak holders The price of Fintec & VC perhaps are encourage to drift lower or kept low as a strategy for accumulation and a means to earn substantial returns. Can also earn handsomely by purposely depressing share price."

Fintec just issued 60 M Esos shares at 8 cts when u can buy it in the Market at 8cts then ....question is why ,,,,& why ... u dont need rocket science to figure out why ...
Just for the records, each time when PP, Esos, SIS etc2 in big number are issued, the shares will spike above the placement price and the reason why is also also not a rocket science ...
So just be patient and wait for it to unfold...

Turkey Of The Year: The rally in penny stocks and their subsequent plunge
TheEdge Tue, Jan 05, 2021 03:30pm - 4 days ago
IN September this year, The Edge ran a piece titled “Hidden hands behind penny stock surge”, which showed the relationship between 21 companies, all connected via similar shareholders and/or directors and all exhibiting unusual peaks and troughs, jolting share prices for no apparent reason.
Behind these companies is an individual or a small group of individuals controlling things and making a mockery of corporate governance standards.
Interestingly enough, it is understood that there are about 40 companies controlled by the hidden hands.
At the apex of the maze of companies is Fintec Global Bhd, a company that does not have a core business except to act as an incubator. On Fintec’s website, it says, “The name ‘Fintec’ mirrors our motto of ‘financials before technology’, that is, we first and foremost look to the existing and/or potential financial performances of the companies in need of capital injections before all other merits such as technology, business nature and business plan are considered.”
According to its annual report, it has investments in start-ups but it is worth noting that Fintec also invests in several small-cap, publicly traded companies.
Companies under Fintec’s belt include Saudee Group Bhd (21.55%), AT Systematization Bhd (28.29%) and Focus Dynamics Group Bhd (25.04%). There are also companies such as Green Ocean Corp Bhd and Trive Property Group Bhd, in which Fintec has indirect stakes via Saudee Group and AT Systematization. It is also noteworthy that at end-November, Fintec ceased to be a substantial shareholder of NetX Holdings Bhd.
Some of these companies, such as Fintec and AT Systematization, were in the news for announcing new ventures, including into glove making. It remains to be seen whether they are successful in these ventures.
Nevertheless, Fintec’s “jewel in the crown” is Focus Dynamics, which operates seven food and beverage outlets. It mustered a net profit of RM7.26 million from RM42.88 million in revenue for the nine months ended September this year. Despite having accumulated losses of RM40.26 million, Focus Dynamics at the time of writing was trading at 65 sen, giving the company a market capitalisation of almost RM4 billion, and was listed on the MSCI global small-cap indices last month.
Whether such a high market value is justified for a company that raked in RM7 million in net profits is questionable. So far this year, Focus Dynamics’ share price has shot up more than 390% from 13 sen as at end-2019, with no apparent reason for the meteoric rise.
Just prior to this article, Fintec pocketed RM26.74 million in cash, selling 768.15 million of Focus Dynamic’s warrants on the open market.
This year alone, Fintec has completed two share placements and one rights issue with free warrants, raising RM182.6 million. Note that as a reprieve to companies hit by the pandemic, Bursa Malaysia relaxed the rules on private placements, allowing listed companies to place out not more than 20% of the total issued shares, from the existing 10%, until Dec 31, 2021 — subject to shareholders’ approval.
Most of the companies in which Fintec invests are loss-making and small in terms of market capitalisation, and seem to lack a clear business direction or strategy.
Other stocks (besides Focus Dynamics) that have shown simi­lar gains but plummeted include loss-making Anzo Holdings Bhd, a company dealing in timber products that gained more than 1,000% from mid-May to hit a high of 26 sen in July. It closed at 8.5 sen on Dec 23, losing 67% from the peak.
PDZ Holdings Bhd, an ailing shipping company, was trading at one sen in mid-March but, at end-June, it gained more than 500% to reach its peak of 32.5 sen this year — a remarkable feat, considering it is mired in lawsuits and has no significant shipping assets. Closing at 7.5 sen on Dec 23, it is down 77% from the peak.
Meanwhile, loss-making XOX Bhd, which is involved in cellular telecommunication services, gained more than 430% from mid-July to hit a high of 39.5 sen at end-August. In mid-March, XOX was trading at one sen.
Anzo, PDZ and XOX are linked to Fintec via its directors. All three companies have announced corporate exercises, including placements of shares and rights issues.
Meanwhile, Saudee Group’s stock hit a low of eight sen on March 17, but picked up momentum in June to hit a 52-week high of 67 sen on Aug 13, gaining more than 300%. It closed at 50 sen on Dec 23 — down 25% from the peak.
While there is reason to believe that the regulators are indeed looking into the companies and their erratic share price movements, and that the authorities have actually commenced investigations, it is unclear whether there will be any follow-up action aside from an unusual market activity (UMA) query by the exchange.

For Immediate Release
FINTEC GLOVE appoints Pasukhas to construct Fintec Glove’s RM60 million main factory building
 To house 14 glove dipping lines with an annual capacity to produce 3.3 billion pieces of
medical grade examination nitrile gloves
 On track to deliver on recently-announced Memorandum of Agreement (“MOA”) for
distribution into European Union market with international distributor Robayu
Corporation sp. z o.o. (“Robayu”)
Petaling Jaya, 27 January 2021 – Fintec Glove Sdn Bhd (“Fintec Glove”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fintec Global Berhad, (“Fintec”) appointed Pasukhas Sdn Bhd (“Pasukhas”) for the design and build construction of its glove manufacturing plant with projected construction value of MYR60 million.
The construction of main factory building is expected to commence on 1 February 2021 and production will begin in July 2021. The main factory building, strategically located on a 4.6-acre land in the heart of Chemor’s industrial site, will house 14 glove double-former dipping lines.
With 14 glove dipping lines, Fintec Glove’s manufacturing capacity would be 32,000 pieces per hour and projected to exceed 3.3 billion pieces per annum.
With this, Fintec Glove is on track to deliver on its recently-announced MOA for distribution into European Union market with international distributor Robayu to supply 42 million pieces monthly of medical grade examination nitrile gloves into Poland and Eastern Europe, starting in the third quarter of 2021.
Simultaneously, Fintec Glove is seeing strong interest from multiple parties to sign long term contracts committing to the future delivery of medical gloves, hence, Fintec Glove believes the outlook for medical glove demand remains positive.
Against a conducive backdrop for medical gloves demand, Fintec Glove expects to recuperate its capital cost within 3 years assuming average selling price of each piece of glove remains above 20 cents per piece. As the pandemic has caused the demand for gloves to spike resulting in a supply shortage, medical gloves are now selling at USD 12 cents per piece."

【本報訊】港龍始創人曹光彪孫女婿疑財困燒炭亡。警方昨日接報，指一名外籍男子躺臥在西貢路邊一輛Tesla電動車的座椅上，懷疑出事昏迷，事主其後由消防救出送院，惜已回天乏術。據悉，死者的妻子為香港「毛紡大王」兼港龍航空始創人曹光彪的孫女，警方在車內發現燒炭餘燼，懷疑有人因金錢壓力困擾尋短。
旗下投資基金曾遭證監會罰250萬
昨晨7時許，有途人發現大網仔路近早禾坑巴士站停泊一輛Tesla電動車，車內一名外籍男子仰臥在拉平的座椅上，似陷不省人事，遂報警處理。消防到場發現車門未有上鎖，旋即救出該名男子，惜他送院經搶救後證實死亡。警員檢查該車車廂，在後座發現一盆燒過的炭，隨後根據車輛登記資料，聯絡事主家屬了解。警方經調查後，證實事主為55歲美國籍男子，現場未有檢獲遺書，但相信案件無可疑。據悉，事主有金錢問題，不排除因財困走上絕路。
據了解，死者為Tesla登記車主。資料顯示，該車於2015年首次登記，車主韓福南（Heffner,Paul Lincoln），是投資基金安德思資產管理（香港）有限公司（Adamas Asset Management）始創人，其妻子曹惠婷是香港「毛紡大王」兼港龍航空創辦人曹光彪孫女。
2019年12月23日證監會公布，安德思因沒有落實足夠的措施，以確保準確及準時地披露8隻香港上市公司股票的須具報權益，故遭證監會譴責並罰款250萬元。該會發現，在2013年2月至2016年3月期間，安德思在將339份披露通知送交存檔時出錯或有所延誤，導致沒有就在其管理的客戶投資組合中的該等香港上市公司股票的所有須具報權益，向聯交所及相關上市公司作出披露。證監會認為，安德思未有落實適當的措施，確保已按照《操守準則》的規定，就香港上市法團的須具報權益妥為披露。

你是fintec 的幕后主谋公司有账面赚接近10亿，focus都不值钱只值几千万卖掉9亿多就是fintec 的了！
为何他没卖？你不好奇啊？哈哈哈
你是fintec 的幕后主谋你会卖掉focus吗?
卖掉focus 整10亿肯定钱就进fintec了的喔....9亿多的钱 派股息那么就是97%的投资人所拥有，大股东拿不到3千万！你们就慢慢等啦...,想的的美哦......幕后主谋完全一角钱都拿不到....你说呢？
幕后主谋根本不打算卖。只给你看到很爽很爽根本不打算请你吃！
Guudi Dahal
又是老话一句， Fintech 背后的大鲨鱼，不是你们想像那样简单。 Fintech owned Focus share，Foucs 的股价去年到今年最少翻了十几倍（庄家控制价钱），账目上Fintech肯定是赚大钱，可是都是股票益价造成的，不是因为它的业绩弄得好！可以买，见好就收！

Champ Hank 疫情期间很多公司亏到一塌糊涂要倒闭，bursa 和 sc 为了不给公司倒闭造成失业率飙高就已经放松不用什么条件让企业可以简单融资，发行股票可以去到增加50%。这些烂公司上市到现在没有可行稳定赚钱的业务，难道他们不会经营生意？
人啊不用我说..平时勤劳不勤劳管理公司有心没心想做不想做罢了！他们都是有钱花不完享受生活做工一条虫过生活一条龙在讲公司几乎都是大众的钱也是大众投的钱都不是老板的自己钱，他们肯定都是在混日子所以公司上市以来几乎年年都亏钱平时年年都集资，你们的钱一部分拿去填洞维持正常运作一部分又拿去做可以不可以行不行的业务然后顺便ang gong 一些进老板口袋。现在放松监管有用到钱没用到钱他们哪里会错过这次机会肯定火力全开集资。

The villagers were very happy, after all there were hundreds of Monkeys in a nearby forest.
They caught the Monkeys and got them to the rich man. He bought hundreds of Monkeys and paid 100 for every Monkey the villagers gave him.
They began to make a living out of getting Monkeys from the forest and selling it to the rich man.
Soon, the forest began to run out of monkeys that were easy to catch.
Sensing this, the rich man offers 200 for every monkey. The villagers were ecstatic.
They went back to the forest, set up traps and caught the monkeys and got them to the rich man.
A few days later, the rich man announced he would pay 300 per monkey.
The villagers began climbing trees and risking their lives to catch monkeys and get them to the rich man – who bought them all.
There were no Monkeys left in the forest!
One day, the rich man announced he would like to buy more monkeys – this time for 800 each.
The villagers couldn’t believe this. They were desperately trying to get more monkeys.
Meanwhile, the rich man said he had to go back to the city on some business work and until he returns his manager would deal on his behalf.
Once he left, the villagers were unhappy. They were making quick and easy money from selling monkeys, but the forest no longer had monkeys.
This is when the manager of the rich man stepped in.
He made an offer the villagers could not refuse.
Pointing out to all the monkeys that the rich man had caged. He told the villagers he would sell the monkeys for 400 each.
“Sell them back to the rich man at 800 each when he comes back” the manager said.
The villagers were over the moon. Buy for 400 and sell for 800 in few days. They had just found the easiest way to double their money.
The villagers collected all their savings and even borrowed money.
There were long queues and within a few hours, almost all the monkeys were sold out.
Unfortunately, their happiness did not last long, as the manager went missing the next day and the rich man never came back.
Many villagers kept the monkeys with them, hoping the rich man would come back. But soon, they lost hope and had to let the monkeys back into the forest as feeding and taking care of the noisy monkeys became extremely difficult."

First, with higher ASP during the pandemic will allow them to recover their cost of investment quickly. Think about the 1 billion profit from Supermax. Scientist already predicted that even with vaccine COVAX, the world will normalize after 2025.
Initially glove order for Fintec is about 39.9 million gloves. Assuming ASP at Europe is price at conservative EU35 or RM170 per box plus additional safety of margin at 30% comes to about RM119 per box. This will account an estimated revenue of RM47.5 million q-o-q or RM189 million.
The EPS is expected to be RM0.015 per quarter. The good news is ASP will be on the rise due to back entry order which pretty much taken up to 2021. It is not only for the vaccine industry but rather for other industrial demands mainly food and sanitizing sector.
Another good news besides low barrier of entry to glove industry is that unlike TG and Supermax where the price reflects current market valuation, Fintec's valuation is not on IB scoreboard yet.

1,120,295 - 0.065 62,052 - 0.070
822,154 - 0.060 516,486 - 0.075
Why is the 0.065 Bid Q so huge today? A lot of players plan to buy, good support like what the cybertropers said? and Why is the 0.070 Sell Q so small? A lot of players eat up the Q? WRONG...
Operation put a big block at 0.065 for few weeks to make sure that NO RETAILS can get the the 0.065 tickets as they wanted to fix the price at 0.070. So that the new ESOS price can be fixed around ~0.63sen or lower (10% Discount from the average price, which is around 7sen). They want retails to buy at 0.07 or higher. After finish the 0.070 Q, they will put more tickets at 0.07 again and repeat.
After getting the new ESOS, they will release some HOA, LOA, MOU or any kind of rubbish collaboration news between their rotten companies. Then they will put a big block at 0.075 (make sure all their tickets are Q in front of retails tickets). And make the 0.07 Q small enough for them to sell with news. So those who bought at 0.07 now, have to sell back at max 0.07 (lose broker fee, but most of the retails dream that operator will push higher than 0.07, so they wait). From time to time, the 0.07 will be finished and eat into 0.075 which are all their tickets, but no way they will push higher.
In short, retail can only buy at 0.07 now, and after ESOS, they can only sell at 0.07, if you insist to trying your luck, maybe you buy now, then can start to Q from now until next month..
Warning sudah bagi, even give the details on how they operate, and still ppl talking about chart la, this la, that la.. XOX bought macpie cheap cheap and now already gain 40% la 50% la etc. Did XOX sell any of the Macpie tickets to get CASH? NO, the operator gang heavily bought into the Macpie shares at lower price, then now they want to use XOX money to buy those tickets from them at ridiculously higher price.
Let me tell you another operator secret. Did you realized that why are all the ""small"" counters (MACPIE, NEXION, CHEETAH and etc) which has news related to XOX fly like no tomorrow but XOX not flying?? Because XOX is the FOCUS counter, meaning they will keep issuing ESOS, SIS, Private Placement, Right Issue to XOX to bring in cash to the company. Then will sell those cheap tickets to the public hands at only 5%-10% gains (example, ESOS at 6.3sen, then sell at 7-7.5sen). Then they will take their cash to go buy Macpie, Nexion, Cheetah (those attached counters) at LOW price. Then at the end, they will use the XOX's cash to goreng up those attached counters until crazy price and buy the expensive tickets from their hands to ENCASH. Explain until like this still cannot understand how they manipulate all the counters??
Yes, if you want a goreng counters, go buy those ATTACHED COUNTERS, NOT the focused on like XOX. However, no body know which is the attach counter before they announced the news. Once they announced the news about which counter is having ""relationship"" with XOX, the attach counter's share price already 3x or 4x folds high, and you still dare to buy? Of course, at the end, XOX will use up all their cash to buy from the operators at high price.
XOX (Focused counter) ---> MACPIE, CHEETAH, NEXION and etc (attached counters)
Go to the list again of what company they owned, you will see that those FOCUSED counters share price keep going down after each SIS/ESOS/PP, but those attached counters keep going up after BIG news announced.
Those who already realized and escaped, thanks me later. Those stubborn one, all the best to you. To the cybertroopers, sorry that I disclose all your tactics, but don worry, there are still plenty of fish for you to catch."

Why is the 0.065 Bid Q so huge today? A lot of players plan to buy, good support like what the cybertropers said? and Why is the 0.070 Sell Q so small? A lot of players eat up the Q? WRONG...
Operation put a big block at 0.065 for few weeks to make sure that NO RETAILS can get the the 0.065 tickets as they wanted to fix the price at 0.070. So that the new ESOS price can be fixed around ~0.63sen or lower (10% Discount from the average price, which is around 7sen). They want retails to buy at 0.07 or higher. After finish the 0.070 Q, they will put more tickets at 0.07 again and repeat.
After getting the new ESOS, they will release some HOA, LOA, MOU or any kind of rubbish collaboration news between their rotten companies. Then they will put a big block at 0.075 (make sure all their tickets are Q in front of retails tickets). And make the 0.07 Q small enough for them to sell with news. So those who bought at 0.07 now, have to sell back at max 0.07 (lose broker fee, but most of the retails dream that operator will push higher than 0.07, so they wait). From time to time, the 0.07 will be finished and eat into 0.075 which are all their tickets, but no way they will push higher.
In short, retail can only buy at 0.07 now, and after ESOS, they can only sell at 0.07, if you insist to trying your luck, maybe you buy now, then can start to Q from now until next month..
Warning sudah bagi, even give the details on how they operate, and still ppl talking about chart la, this la, that la.. XOX bought macpie cheap cheap and now already gain 40% la 50% la etc. Did XOX sell any of the Macpie tickets to get CASH? NO, the operator gang heavily bought into the Macpie shares at lower price, then now they want to use XOX money to buy those tickets from them at ridiculously higher price.
Let me tell you another operator secret. Did you realized that why are all the ""small"" counters (MACPIE, NEXION, CHEETAH and etc) which has news related to XOX fly like no tomorrow but XOX not flying?? Because XOX is the FOCUS counter, meaning they will keep issuing ESOS, SIS, Private Placement, Right Issue to XOX to bring in cash to the company. Then will sell those cheap tickets to the public hands at only 5%-10% gains (example, ESOS at 6.3sen, then sell at 7-7.5sen). Then they will take their cash to go buy Macpie, Nexion, Cheetah (those attached counters) at LOW price. Then at the end, they will use the XOX's cash to goreng up those attached counters until crazy price and buy the expensive tickets from their hands to ENCASH. Explain until like this still cannot understand how they manipulate all the counters??
Yes, if you want a goreng counters, go buy those ATTACHED COUNTERS, NOT the focused on like XOX. However, no body know which is the attach counter before they announced the news.

Congratulation all XOX supporter. Another 30% ESOS which potentially make total number of share to 5.1Billion units. 5.1 Billions you know, the one ended with B. Or 5100million units of shares and keep talking about the historical high profit of RM 5.7 mil (with fake unrealized gain).
Discover anything today?
Bid Queue Sell Queue
1,120,295 - 0.065 62,052 - 0.070
822,154 - 0.060 516,486 - 0.075
Why is the 0.065 Bid Q so huge today? A lot of players plan to buy, good support like what the cybertropers said? and Why is the 0.070 Sell Q so small? A lot of players eat up the Q? WRONG...
Operation put a big block at 0.065 for few weeks to make sure that NO RETAILS can get the the 0.065 tickets as they wanted to fix the price at 0.070. So that the new ESOS price can be fixed around ~0.63sen or lower (10% Discount from the average price, which is around 7sen). They want retails to buy at 0.07 or higher. After finish the 0.070 Q, they will put more tickets at 0.07 again and repeat.
After getting the new ESOS, they will release some HOA, LOA, MOU or any kind of rubbish collaboration news between their rotten companies. Then they will put a big block at 0.075 (make sure all their tickets are Q in front of retails tickets). And make the 0.07 Q small enough for them to sell with news. So those who bought at 0.07 now, have to sell back at max 0.07 (lose broker fee, but most of the retails dream that operator will push higher than 0.07, so they wait). From time to time, the 0.07 will be finished and eat into 0.075 which are all their tickets, but no way they will push higher.
In short, retail can only buy at 0.07 now, and after ESOS, they can only sell at 0.07, if you insist to trying your luck, maybe you buy now, then can start to Q from now until next month..
Warning sudah bagi, even give the details on how they operate, and still ppl talking about chart la, this la, that la.. XOX bought macpie cheap cheap and now already gain 40% la 50% la etc. Did XOX sell any of the Macpie tickets to get CASH? NO, the operator gang heavily bought into the Macpie shares at lower price, then now they want to use XOX money to buy those tickets from them at ridiculously higher price.
Let me tell you another operator secret. Did you realized that why are all the ""small"" counters (MACPIE, NEXION, CHEETAH and etc) which has news related to XOX fly like no tomorrow but XOX not flying?? Because XOX is the FOCUS counter, meaning they will keep issuing ESOS, SIS, Private Placement, Right Issue to XOX to bring in cash to the company. Then will sell those cheap tickets to the public hands at only 5%-10% gains (example, ESOS at 6.3sen, then sell at 7-7.5sen). Then they will take their cash to go buy Macpie, Nexion, Cheetah (those attached counters) at LOW price. Then at the end, they will use the XOX's cash to goreng up those attached counters until crazy price and buy the expensive tickets from their hands to ENCASH. Explain until like this still cannot understand how they manipulate all the counters??
Yes, if you want a goreng counters, go buy those ATTACHED COUNTERS, NOT the focused on like XOX. However, no body know which is the attach counter before they announced the news. Once they announced the news about which counter is having ""relationship"" with XOX, the attach counter's share price already 3x or 4x folds high, and you still dare to buy? Of course, at the end, XOX will use up all their cash to buy from the operators at high price.
XOX (Focused counter) ---> MACPIE, CHEETAH, NEXION and etc (attached counters)
Go to the list again of what company they owned, you will see that those FOCUSED counters share price keep going down after each SIS/ESOS/PP, but those attached counters keep going up after BIG news announced.
Those who already realized and escaped, thanks me later. Those stubborn one, all the best to you. To the cybertroopers, sorry that I disclose all your tactics, but don worry, there are still plenty of fish for you to catch"

IF a company’s shares are considered a form of currency, many small cap companies have been minting money via a series of private placements of new shares over the past 18 months.
A random check on penny stocks shows that the share capital of many of these companies have increased manifold. Among them are AT Systematization Bhd, Vsolar Group Bhd, Oversea Enterprise Bhd, Green Ocean Corp Bhd and Fintec Global Bhd.
The share issuance spree started to gain momentum after Bursa Malaysia relaxed the rules on private placement last April at the peak of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The stock exchange raised the private placement general mandate to 20% of a company’s issued share capital, from 10% previously. The threshold is lower than other bourses, including those of Hong Kong and Singapore.
On top of that, companies are permitted to issue up to 30% of their existing share capital in a share placement if the shareholders approve the exercise at an extraordinary general meeting.
The regulators said the relaxation of the rule — until year-end — is an interim measure to help public-listed companies that urgently need to raise fresh capital to sustain their operations during these trying times.
Many small cap companies have opted for the interim measure to raise fresh cash for working capital and future investments or for new business ventures, for instance, production of rubber gloves or distribution of vaccines and Covid-19 test kits.
Fresh capital raised from secondary issuance soared by 76% to RM8 billion in 2020, according to the Securities Commission — evidence of interest in share placements and rights issues.
Coincidentally, most of these companies have a rather similar pattern of fundraising exercises, consisting of a share placement, followed by a cash call and share issuance schemes to reward employees, especially the board of directors.
It is also worth noting that the share prices of such small cap companies usually shoot up soon after these fundraising exercises, despite their dismal earnings performance. Below are some of the companies which have seen a significant increase in their share capital.
AT Systematization
Topping the list is ATS, one of the companies that have ventured into rubber glove manufacturing. Its total outstanding shares swelled by 811% to 4.23 billion shares between Jan 1, 2020, and March 15, 2021, according to Bloomberg data.
ATS, in which Fintec Global holds a 9.9% stake, carried out two private placements during the year. The first was proposed in August and the second in November. It issued a total of 1.34 billion shares to raise about RM159.5 million.
The first placement was priced at 6.3 sen to 7.16 sen. Its share price ranged between seven sen and 10 sen in October 2020, when it completed the placement.
The second placement was issued in December at between 15.95 sen and 18 sen — more than 50% higher than the previous one, thanks to the hike in ATS’s share price over the two months.
The first placement was to finance its diversification into the manufacturing and sale of rubber gloves and related machinery, which was in line with its proposed acquisition of industrial glove maker Pearl Glove (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd.
The acquisition was cancelled in November, however, with the group citing the non-fulfilment of certain conditions, without elaborating on them. In January 2021, ATS sued the shareholders of Pearl Glove for RM4.4 million, as it was not satisfied with the result of the exercise.
The second placement was to raise funds for capex for the glove business as well as working capital purposes, as the company was setting up its rubber glove plant in Perak.
Besides share placements, ATS had also undertaken a rights issue of 991.2 million shares to raise RM34.7 million. The proceeds were earmarked for the expansion of its production capacity, repayment of bank borrowings and working capital.
On top of that, ATS has rewarded its employees with share issuance schemes. As at March 10, eligible staff had exercised options amounting to 1.45 billion shares.

Congratulation all XOX supporter. Another 30% ESOS which potentially make total number of share to 5.1Billion units. 5.1 Billions you know, the one ended with B. Or 5100million units of shares and keep talking about the historical high profit of RM 5.7 mil (with fake unrealized gain).

1,120,295 - 0.065 62,052 - 0.070
822,154 - 0.060 516,486 - 0.075
Why is the 0.065 Bid Q so huge today? A lot of players plan to buy, good support like what the cybertropers said? and Why is the 0.070 Sell Q so small? A lot of players eat up the Q? WRONG...
Operation put a big block at 0.065 for few weeks to make sure that NO RETAILS can get the the 0.065 tickets as they wanted to fix the price at 0.070. So that the new ESOS price can be fixed around ~0.63sen or lower (10% Discount from the average price, which is around 7sen). They want retails to buy at 0.07 or higher. After finish the 0.070 Q, they will put more tickets at 0.07 again and repeat.
After getting the new ESOS, they will release some HOA, LOA, MOU or any kind of rubbish collaboration news between their rotten companies. Then they will put a big block at 0.075 (make sure all their tickets are Q in front of retails tickets). And make the 0.07 Q small enough for them to sell with news. So those who bought at 0.07 now, have to sell back at max 0.07 (lose broker fee, but most of the retails dream that operator will push higher than 0.07, so they wait). From time to time, the 0.07 will be finished and eat into 0.075 which are all their tickets, but no way they will push higher.
In short, retail can only buy at 0.07 now, and after ESOS, they can only sell at 0.07, if you insist to trying your luck, maybe you buy now, then can start to Q from now until next month..
Warning sudah bagi, even give the details on how they operate, and still ppl talking about chart la, this la, that la.. XOX bought macpie cheap cheap and now already gain 40% la 50% la etc. Did XOX sell any of the Macpie tickets to get CASH? NO, the operator gang heavily bought into the Macpie shares at lower price, then now they want to use XOX money to buy those tickets from them at ridiculously higher price.
Let me tell you another operator secret. Did you realized that why are all the ""small"" counters (MACPIE, NEXION, CHEETAH and etc) which has news related to XOX fly like no tomorrow but XOX not flying?? Because XOX is the FOCUS counter, meaning they will keep issuing ESOS, SIS, Private Placement, Right Issue to XOX to bring in cash to the company. Then will sell those cheap tickets to the public hands at only 5%-10% gains (example, ESOS at 6.3sen, then sell at 7-7.5sen). Then they will take their cash to go buy Macpie, Nexion, Cheetah (those attached counters) at LOW price. Then at the end, they will use the XOX's cash to goreng up those attached counters until crazy price and buy the expensive tickets from their hands to ENCASH. Explain until like this still cannot understand how they manipulate all the counters??
Yes, if you want a goreng counters, go buy those ATTACHED COUNTERS, NOT the focused on like XOX. However, no body know which is the attach counter before they announced the news. Once they announced the news about which counter is having ""relationship"" with XOX, the attach counter's share price already 3x or 4x folds high, and you still dare to buy? Of course, at the end, XOX will use up all their cash to buy from the operators at high price.
XOX (Focused counter) ---> MACPIE, CHEETAH, NEXION and etc (attached counters)
Go to the list again of what company they owned, you will see that those FOCUSED counters share price keep going down after each SIS/ESOS/PP, but those attached counters keep going up after BIG news announced.
Those who already realized and escaped, thanks me later. Those stubborn one, all the best to you. To the cybertroopers, sorry that I disclose all your tactics, but don worry, there are still plenty of fish for you to catch."

SC to show how Ricky Wong siphoned over RM50m from Bright Packaging Industry via rights issue, private placement, ESOS
TheEdge Mon, Apr 05, 2021 02:24pm - 1 hour ago
KUALA LUMPUR (April 5): The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) intends to demonstrate how Datuk Ricky Wong Shee Kai siphoned approximately RM56 million from Bright Packaging Industry Bhd (BPI) via a series of corporate exercises between 2013 and 2015, comprising a rights issue, a private placement and two rounds of an employee share option scheme (ESOS).
In his opening statement for the trial, which commenced this morning, senior lawyer Datuk Lim Chee Wee, representing the SC, told the court that the defendants Wong, his mother Teh Sew Wan and Wong SK Holdings Sdn Bhd have contravened the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007 (CMSA) in using devices, schemes or artifices to defraud BPI and/or engaging in acts, practices or courses of business which operated as a fraud upon BPI.
Both Wong and Teh are the directors of Wong SK Holdings. Wong and Wong SK Holdings were represented by lawyer Datuk Harpal Singh Grewal.
""The evidence shows that the proceeds were paid out by BPI to suppliers of BPI, who were in actual fact nominee companies controlled by the defendants.
""These monies were eventually transferred to the defendants. The monies were paid out by BPI after each BPI corporate exercise within a very short period, ranging from one day to two weeks after the completion,"" said Lim.
He alleged that these companies were controlled by Wong and were used as a front to propel the defendants' fraudulent conduct, which resulted in unlawful pecuniary gain of at least RM56.07 million.
The nominee companies had received monies from BPI following each corporate exercise by way of cheques authorised by Teh, based on fictitious transactions, which were eventually transferred to Wong or Wong SK Holdings.
The SC in its investigations found that the monies from each exercise were transferred from BPI via layers of these nominee companies, which ultimately ends up in either Wong's HSBC account, Alliance Bank account or Wong SK Holdings' Ambank account.
Besides using these nominee companies, Wong had allegedly provided the funding for former BPI director Datuk Seri Syed Ali Al-Habshee's subscription of the rights shares and the subsequent disposal of the shares and the transfer of proceeds to Wong.
Syed Ali, the former UMNO Cheras division chief, claimed to have had no knowledge of his subscription and disposal of the rights shares, as well as the transfer of proceeds to Wong.
Moreover, he also provided funding for five BPI employees to subscribe to two rounds of ESOS, although the five claimed they had no knowledge of their respective subscription of the shares.
Syed Ali and the five employees, namely Chew Chen Nie, Lee Woan Jiun, Chan Kok Leong, Kok Meow Imm and Teoh Hock Heng, will be appearing as witnesses in the trial, along with 14 others.
The first witness to appear in court was TA Securities deputy vice president of corporate finance Sim Hui-Leen, who went over each of the CPI corporate exercises during the examination-in-chief by Lim.
Cross-examination by the defendants' lawyers is slated for Sept 21, as the trial was adjourned amid the discharging of Teh's lawyers Nicholas Kow and Emile Ezra Hussain, as she felt that the lawyers cannot act in her best interest.
Judicial commissioner Anand Ponnudurai warned her that there will not be anymore postponements once the trial resumes in September.
""There will be no further adjournments. Please appoint new lawyers by this week. If the lawyers come into the court saying that they are not free on the dates fixed, please find other lawyers,"" he urged the defendant."

盘查操控60仙股神秘黑手事件
10/04/2021
权威财经周刊THE EDGE报导揭露，执法当局在数个星期前，突袭及盘查雪州丽阳高球俱乐部一带的联和大（MENARA LIEN HOE）数家公司，取走文件，以调查数名特定人士参与操纵大马交易所仙股案件。
THE EDGE报导说，执法当局是接获投报，指国内一个由数个神秘人物控制的集团，控制高达60家上市公司，并通过种种手段，操纵股价，更以各种财技手法，从上市公司吸资金或资产。
报导说，调查焦点集中於一名四十岁左右神秘企业家，该名人士通过代理控制大量上市公司，但是却没有一间上市公司和他有直接关系。
THE EDGE制作一个图表，列出和这名神秘企业家有关的数十家上市公司，大多数由SANSTON FINANCIAL GROUP控制，这家公司是由香港SANSTON持有，根据这家公司官网显示，它是持有香港牌照的证券行。
THE EDGE在报导中引述一些部落格撰文指出，该名男子控仙股的规模和手法，堪称是另一个＂苏启文＂，市场上有关该名人士操控多家上市公司的传言，流传多个月。
根据了解，有两个执法单位，即反贪污委员会和内陆税收局参与有关执法行动，突袭联和大厦，但是证券监督委员会并没有在行动中。
THE EDGE也引述消息说，国家银行正在紧密观察该集团的动向。
该集团控制的40家上市公司中，有11家办事处设在联和大厦，包括宜鼎（AT），MLABS，富科斯（FOCUS），万科科技（MTOUCHE），FINTEC环球（FINTEC），XOX说（XOX），M3科技（M3TECH），NETX HOLDING，LAMBO GROUP，KGROUP，VSOLAR集团等。"

矛头指向前上市公司董事 苏式小股风暴大马上演？
Nanyang Mon, Apr 12, 2021 11:24pm - 12 hours ago
（吉隆坡12日讯）财经周刊《The Edge》报道，60多只热炒仙股背后的势力已经引起市场和执法单位的关注，其集团头目更是被一些部落格网站拿来与涉及新加坡2013年“小股风暴”案的拿督苏启文相提并论。
根据本报在网上的观察，这些部落格指向的人物是一名前上市公司董事，在数年前曾因涉及操纵股价而被证监会提控。
《TheEdge》引述消息人士说：“这伙人中的头目是个聪明的人……他完全没有出面，所以线索没有指向他。我们无法证明他在这个事件的幕后，所以很难归罪于他。”
报道称，这伙人的头目没有与这些上市公司有直接的关系，并很好地利用了香港股票经纪公司Sanston金融集团作为其代理，将60多家公司把控在掌心中；该头目据称年龄接近50岁。
另外，《The Edge》也指出，虽然据了解该集团所掌控的本地上市公司数量超过60家，但该报仅找得到其中40多家涉及公司的线索。
证监会密切关注
本报也尝试联络这些被点名公司的媒体方负责人，但截稿前尚未收到回复。
税收局和反贪会是在数周前，突击了这伙人在雪州Persiaran Tropicana路附近的联和大厦办公楼，并带走了相关文件；单单这家大厦，就是多达11家涉及公司的大本营。
另外，尽管证监会没有参与其中，但问及有否展开调查时，该机构以其政策为由，不透露任何详情。
不过，一个靠近证监会的消息人士透露，证监会已关注着这伙人和他们操控股票的行为一段时间了。
国行关注有否洗黑钱
另一消息人士还指出，国家银行也正监视着该头目与同伙，看是否能从中发现到洗黑钱的行动。
根据了解这些上市公司内部营运的消息人士，公司内的资产与资金已被转走。
例如，在今年1月，XOX说电讯（XOX，0165，创业板）崛起为DGB亚洲（DGB，0152，创业板）大股东；FINTEC环球（FINTEC，0150，创业板）在去年7月，才卖出DGB亚洲股权，不再是大股东。
积极发股筹资
根据《TheEdge》资料，Sanston直接持有FINTEC环球4.61%股权，后者间接持股的Key Alliance（KGROUP，0036，创业板），直接持有XOX说电讯10%股权。
同时，这些上市公司几乎都发股筹资，目的可能是为了发行新股，和收购资产。
当中，如宜鼎系统（AT，0072，创业板）、VSolar集团（VSOLAR，0066，创业板）和FINTEC环球，更是趁着马交所近期放松发股10%门槛之便，借机发行更高的20%，乃至30%新股。
单在年初截至上月中，宜鼎系统进行了两次私配和一次附加股发行后，股本就大幅扩大逾8倍，至42.3亿股；该公司也透过雇员认股计划（ESOS），在上月发行多达14.5亿股新股。"

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000170.jsp?ftp=518","May 6, 2021 5:37 PM","OpporturnityHunter","为什么不断有大单买入，但股价却不断下跌？后悔自己知道晚了。这种情况只有发生在个股暴涨过后庄家开始出货的时候。股价在低位还没上涨是不可能出现这种情况的。在投机的赌场市，所有的股票都是用来炒作的，任何股票机构庄家炒高后就通过卖出股票获得暴利，因此，在A股市场所有的股票炒高后庄家机构都会在高位出货，机构庄家在高位出货怎么出呢？就是利用机构庄家手里掌握的多外账户进行对倒，在高位反复拉升吸引散户来跟风追涨，散户买股票喜欢追热点股，散户容易受到股评的影响，股评通过各种媒体进行鼓吹帮助机构庄家高位出货，于是大量不明真相的散户就在庄家对倒盘的吸引下在高位买进股票，而庄家借此机会高位出货。庄家对倒的成交量是自己卖给自己，庄家自己高位买盘是假，当有一定数量的散户来买时，庄家卖出才是真的，而庄家高位大单买入是只挂单，少量成交来吸引散户买入，当有散户买入时，庄家就会主动撤销买单，让散户去高位买。
因此，我们看到的高位大单买入只是庄家为了诱多挂上去给散户看的，并不是真的买入，即使买入也庄家利用对倒自己买卖，只是账户不同，但实际上都是庄家自己掌握的账户，只要能吸引到大量的散户来买入，庄家就会快速卖出其他账户的股票。这就是高位庄家出货时表面上看上去不断有大单买入，股价却在不断下跌的真正原因。
股价只是反应当时股票交易价格，有卖才能有买。有大单买入说明买家看好这支股票的未来成长性。同样买家能买到这么多，说明同时有这么多卖家在卖出。同样也说明有这么多人不看好这支股票的未来成长性。当然这其中还会有其他因素，比如获利退出，比如机构需要回笼资金等等，总之是有人在卖出。
所以不能单纯的以有大单买入判断股价应该上涨，还得看其他更多人是否有信心。就以最近几天股市来看，大手笔买入的股票不在少数，短期股价也确实被拉升上来了，但没过一天又放量下跌，市场实在没信心。
“主力”、“庄家”也是股市中经常被提级的，散户是既爱又恨，却也没任何办法。 只要不是像工商银行、中国石油这样的大盘股，一般盘子小一些的股票，还是有很多资金量足够的机构可以左右一下股价的，比如他们想低价建仓，或者想高价退出，都会使用大单做一些小动作。因为这种大单很容易被散户捕捉到。 因为这种事情被处罚的人并不少，甚至获刑的也有之，但利益实在太大，所以总会有人前仆后继，区别只在于是否被发现而已。
所以遇到这样的情况不要奇怪。坤鹏论仍然建议我们在选股票的时候要选企业经营好的，而不是短期盈利多的，这样风险才小，过度关注大单买入、卖出的价值并不大。
如何判断股价上涨的真假
股价变动是通过涨跌来体现的。我们这里所说的涨跌，不是指每日涨一点或跌一点的小波动，而是指股价持续阶段波动或者日涨跌幅度很大的波动。在底部区域，一只股票成交量不能太少，特别是振幅不能太小，成交量少、振幅小的股票没有弹性，后市潜力可能不大。一只股票经常在涨幅排行榜前列出现，也经常在跌幅排行榜前列出现，敢涨也敢跌的股票才是好股票（以庄家没有赚过钱为前提）。这样的股票以后可能成为大“黑马”，值得重点关注。对待上涨，最关键的是要区分清楚股价是不是真正的上涨。
（1）从来没有上涨过的，而且股票价格定位又不高的，真涨的可能性就大。
（2）股价离庄家成本不远的，上涨的概率就很大。
（3）股价位置低，经过了充分盘整的，上涨的概率就更大。
（4）没有消息，没有明显上涨理由的（主要指利好刺激），真涨的可能性很大。如果短期配合出利好消息的，则只是小一段。
（5）因为出现突发性利好而上涨的，上涨可能持续不了多久。已经涨幅巨大的，下跌不久就要来临。
（6）缺少成交量配合的上涨，真实程度不够（除非经过放巨量震荡整理后缩量上行，且是控盘的庄股，此类股票以后不会太多）。
（7）没有气势的涨是虚涨（除非持续不断小阳上涨，且温和放量），上涨可能是假的。
（8）上涨过快的股票，除非经过长期的震荡整理，且量价配合理想，并刚刚进入庄家的拉升阶段，否则当心“震荡”或反转。快得很有“气势”的，可能是短跑黑马。
（9）慢涨盘面上如果有慢的手法，经常有点“花招”又长期不涨，让人腻味的；股民不愿参与的，没有持股信心的；股价位置不高，又经历了充分震荡、换手的，可能是大黑马。
（10）经过充分炒作累计上涨幅度巨大的股票，一旦开始下跌，其后可能有数次间歇性的上涨。尽管有时幅度还不小，但这仅仅是反弹而已。快跑为妙，千万不要抱有任何幻想。
我们对待涨跌都应该有一个直接的认识。上涨不一定都是好事，顶部阶段的放量暴涨，下跌途中的单日放量突涨，以及平衡市和熊市中遇反弹时的大涨，可能都不是什么“福音”。
因此对股价的涨跌，应辩证地看待。上涨蕴含着的是风险，下跌孕育着的是机会。涨虽然是机会，但如果涨得不真实或涨的基础不牢靠或者上涨的幅度过大、过急，则上涨就蕴含着风险，并且伴随着上涨，下跌是迟早的事情，而下跌的机会则更大。首先，只涨不跌就积累了巨大的风险，涨幅越大则风险越大，而下跌可以化解风险。其次，经过下跌以后，上涨基础反倒是坚实的，并且下跌为上涨积累了能量。最后，股市是逐利的场所，下跌幅度越大，机会就明显越大（以不是熊市前提），追逐利润最大化的新多庄家就会入场，赚钱的机会也就来了。
震仓、拉高、出货、反弹行情中常用的几种
对敲庄家对敲主要是利用成交量制造有利于庄家的股票价位，吸引散户跟进或卖出。庄家经常在建仓、震仓、拉高、出货、反弹行情中运用对敲。庄家对敲的方式主要有以下几种：
第一：建仓。通过对敲的手法来打压股票价格，以便在低价位买到更多更便宜的筹码。在个股的K线表现为股票处于低位时，股价往往以小阴小阳沿10日线持续上扬。这说明有庄家在拉高建仓，然后出现成交量放大并且股价连续的阴线下跌，而股价下跌就是庄家利用大手笔对敲来打压股价。这期间K线图的主要特征是：股票价格基本是处于低位横盘（也有拉涨停的），但成交量却明显增加，从盘口看股票下跌时的每笔成交量明显大于上涨或者横盘时的每笔成交量。这时的每笔成交会维持在相对较高的水平（因为在低位进行对敲散户尚未大举跟进）。另外，在低位时庄家更多的运用夹板的手法，既上下都有大的买卖单，中间相差几分钱，同时不断有小买单吃货，其目的就是让投资者觉得该股抛压沉重上涨乏力，而抛出手中股票。
第二：拉升。利用对敲的手法来大幅度拉抬股价。庄家利用较大的手笔大量对敲，制造该股票被市场看好的假象，提升投资者的期望值，减少日后该股票在高位盘整时的抛盘压力（散户跟他抢着出货）。这个时期散户投资者往往有买不到的感觉，需要高报许多价位才能成交，从盘口看小手笔的买单往往不容易成交，而每笔成交量明显有节奏放大。强势股的买卖盘均有3位数以上，股价上涨很轻快，不会有向下掉的感觉，下边的买盘跟进很快，这时的每笔成交会有所减少（因为对敲拉抬股价，不可能像吸筹时再投入更多资金，加上散户跟风者众多，所以虽出现“价量齐升”，但“每笔成交”会有所减少）。
第三：震仓洗盘。因为跟风盘获利比较丰厚，庄家一般会采用大幅度对敲震仓的手法使一些不够坚定的投资者出局。从盘口看在盘中震荡时，高点和低点的成交量明显放大，这是庄家为了控制股价涨跌幅度而用相当大的对敲手笔控制股票价格造成的。
第四：对敲拉高。当经过高位的对敲震仓之后，股评家也都长线看好，股价再次以巨量上攻。这时庄家开始出货，从盘口看往往是盘面上出现的卖二、卖三上成交的较大手笔，而我们并没有看到卖二、卖三上有非常大的卖单，而成交之后，原来买一或者是买二甚至是买三上的买单已经不见了，或者减小了，这往往是庄家运用比较微妙的时间差报单的方法对一些经验不足的投资者布下的陷阱，散户吃进的往往是庄家事先挂好的卖单，而接庄家卖出的往往是跟风的散户。
第五：反弹对敲。庄家出货之后，股票价格下跌，许多跟风买进的中小散户已经套牢，成交量明显萎缩，庄家会找机会用较大的手笔连续对敲拉抬股价（这时庄家不会向以前那样卖力了），较大的买卖盘总是突然出现又突然消失，因为庄家此时对敲拉抬的目的只是适当的拉高股价，以便能够把手中最后的筹码也卖个好价钱。
盘后我们怎么去快速选出超短线需要密切关注的票呢?其实选股方法少说也有几千种，我想没有人统计过，我用过许多选股指标，不是选不出股票就是选出一大堆，而且成功率也不高。我说过我是个喜欢折腾的人，折腾指标、折腾预警、折腾选股，经过一些日子实践，针对超短线，总结出一套自己的选股方法，又快成功率又高，现用图文讲解公之于众，算是抛砖引玉吧"

Expect Fintec to revert their financial accounting on their investment portfolio, to be on Equity Basis and that will put the company of firmer footing in respect to their Q Reporting , without the wild swing on their quoted investment portfolio. But they will have to take a hit based on the valuation of their portfolio investment on their balance sheet, which will reduce their NTA from 40cts plus too around appro 15cts plus....

因此，我们看到的高位大单买入只是庄家为了诱多挂上去给散户看的，并不是真的买入，即使买入也庄家利用对倒自己买卖，只是账户不同，但实际上都是庄家自己掌握的账户，只要能吸引到大量的散户来买入，庄家就会快速卖出其他账户的股票。这就是高位庄家出货时表面上看上去不断有大单买入，股价却在不断下跌的真正原因。
股价只是反应当时股票交易价格，有卖才能有买。有大单买入说明买家看好这支股票的未来成长性。同样买家能买到这么多，说明同时有这么多卖家在卖出。同样也说明有这么多人不看好这支股票的未来成长性。当然这其中还会有其他因素，比如获利退出，比如机构需要回笼资金等等，总之是有人在卖出。
所以不能单纯的以有大单买入判断股价应该上涨，还得看其他更多人是否有信心。就以最近几天股市来看，大手笔买入的股票不在少数，短期股价也确实被拉升上来了，但没过一天又放量下跌，市场实在没信心。
“主力”、“庄家”也是股市中经常被提级的，散户是既爱又恨，却也没任何办法。 只要不是像工商银行、中国石油这样的大盘股，一般盘子小一些的股票，还是有很多资金量足够的机构可以左右一下股价的，比如他们想低价建仓，或者想高价退出，都会使用大单做一些小动作。因为这种大单很容易被散户捕捉到。 因为这种事情被处罚的人并不少，甚至获刑的也有之，但利益实在太大，所以总会有人前仆后继，区别只在于是否被发现而已。
所以遇到这样的情况不要奇怪。坤鹏论仍然建议我们在选股票的时候要选企业经营好的，而不是短期盈利多的，这样风险才小，过度关注大单买入、卖出的价值并不大。
如何判断股价上涨的真假
股价变动是通过涨跌来体现的。我们这里所说的涨跌，不是指每日涨一点或跌一点的小波动，而是指股价持续阶段波动或者日涨跌幅度很大的波动。在底部区域，一只股票成交量不能太少，特别是振幅不能太小，成交量少、振幅小的股票没有弹性，后市潜力可能不大。一只股票经常在涨幅排行榜前列出现，也经常在跌幅排行榜前列出现，敢涨也敢跌的股票才是好股票（以庄家没有赚过钱为前提）。这样的股票以后可能成为大“黑马”，值得重点关注。对待上涨，最关键的是要区分清楚股价是不是真正的上涨。
（1）从来没有上涨过的，而且股票价格定位又不高的，真涨的可能性就大。
（2）股价离庄家成本不远的，上涨的概率就很大。
（3）股价位置低，经过了充分盘整的，上涨的概率就更大。
（4）没有消息，没有明显上涨理由的（主要指利好刺激），真涨的可能性很大。如果短期配合出利好消息的，则只是小一段。
（5）因为出现突发性利好而上涨的，上涨可能持续不了多久。已经涨幅巨大的，下跌不久就要来临。
（6）缺少成交量配合的上涨，真实程度不够（除非经过放巨量震荡整理后缩量上行，且是控盘的庄股，此类股票以后不会太多）。
（7）没有气势的涨是虚涨（除非持续不断小阳上涨，且温和放量），上涨可能是假的。
（8）上涨过快的股票，除非经过长期的震荡整理，且量价配合理想，并刚刚进入庄家的拉升阶段，否则当心“震荡”或反转。快得很有“气势”的，可能是短跑黑马。
（9）慢涨盘面上如果有慢的手法，经常有点“花招”又长期不涨，让人腻味的；股民不愿参与的，没有持股信心的；股价位置不高，又经历了充分震荡、换手的，可能是大黑马。
（10）经过充分炒作累计上涨幅度巨大的股票，一旦开始下跌，其后可能有数次间歇性的上涨。尽管有时幅度还不小，但这仅仅是反弹而已。快跑为妙，千万不要抱有任何幻想。
我们对待涨跌都应该有一个直接的认识。上涨不一定都是好事，顶部阶段的放量暴涨，下跌途中的单日放量突涨，以及平衡市和熊市中遇反弹时的大涨，可能都不是什么“福音”。
因此对股价的涨跌，应辩证地看待。上涨蕴含着的是风险，下跌孕育着的是机会。涨虽然是机会，但如果涨得不真实或涨的基础不牢靠或者上涨的幅度过大、过急，则上涨就蕴含着风险，并且伴随着上涨，下跌是迟早的事情，而下跌的机会则更大。首先，只涨不跌就积累了巨大的风险，涨幅越大则风险越大，而下跌可以化解风险。其次，经过下跌以后，上涨基础反倒是坚实的，并且下跌为上涨积累了能量。最后，股市是逐利的场所，下跌幅度越大，机会就明显越大（以不是熊市前提），追逐利润最大化的新多庄家就会入场，赚钱的机会也就来了。
震仓、拉高、出货、反弹行情中常用的几种
对敲庄家对敲主要是利用成交量制造有利于庄家的股票价位，吸引散户跟进或卖出。庄家经常在建仓、震仓、拉高、出货、反弹行情中运用对敲。庄家对敲的方式主要有以下几种：
第一：建仓。通过对敲的手法来打压股票价格，以便在低价位买到更多更便宜的筹码。在个股的K线表现为股票处于低位时，股价往往以小阴小阳沿10日线持续上扬。这说明有庄家在拉高建仓，然后出现成交量放大并且股价连续的阴线下跌，而股价下跌就是庄家利用大手笔对敲来打压股价。这期间K线图的主要特征是：股票价格基本是处于低位横盘（也有拉涨停的），但成交量却明显增加，从盘口看股票下跌时的每笔成交量明显大于上涨或者横盘时的每笔成交量。这时的每笔成交会维持在相对较高的水平（因为在低位进行对敲散户尚未大举跟进）。另外，在低位时庄家更多的运用夹板的手法，既上下都有大的买卖单，中间相差几分钱，同时不断有小买单吃货，其目的就是让投资者觉得该股抛压沉重上涨乏力，而抛出手中股票。
第二：拉升。利用对敲的手法来大幅度拉抬股价。庄家利用较大的手笔大量对敲，制造该股票被市场看好的假象，提升投资者的期望值，减少日后该股票在高位盘整时的抛盘压力（散户跟他抢着出货）。这个时期散户投资者往往有买不到的感觉，需要高报许多价位才能成交，从盘口看小手笔的买单往往不容易成交，而每笔成交量明显有节奏放大。强势股的买卖盘均有3位数以上，股价上涨很轻快，不会有向下掉的感觉，下边的买盘跟进很快，这时的每笔成交会有所减少（因为对敲拉抬股价，不可能像吸筹时再投入更多资金，加上散户跟风者众多，所以虽出现“价量齐升”，但“每笔成交”会有所减少）。
第三：震仓洗盘。因为跟风盘获利比较丰厚，庄家一般会采用大幅度对敲震仓的手法使一些不够坚定的投资者出局。从盘口看在盘中震荡时，高点和低点的成交量明显放大，这是庄家为了控制股价涨跌幅度而用相当大的对敲手笔控制股票价格造成的。
第四：对敲拉高。当经过高位的对敲震仓之后，股评家也都长线看好，股价再次以巨量上攻。这时庄家开始出货，从盘口看往往是盘面上出现的卖二、卖三上成交的较大手笔，而我们并没有看到卖二、卖三上有非常大的卖单，而成交之后，原来买一或者是买二甚至是买三上的买单已经不见了，或者减小了，这往往是庄家运用比较微妙的时间差报单的方法对一些经验不足的投资者布下的陷阱，散户吃进的往往是庄家事先挂好的卖单，而接庄家卖出的往往是跟风的散户。
第五：反弹对敲。庄家出货之后，股票价格下跌，许多跟风买进的中小散户已经套牢，成交量明显萎缩，庄家会找机会用较大的手笔连续对敲拉抬股价（这时庄家不会向以前那样卖力了），较大的买卖盘总是突然出现又突然消失，因为庄家此时对敲拉抬的目的只是适当的拉高股价，以便能够把手中最后的筹码也卖个好价钱。
盘后我们怎么去快速选出超短线需要密切关注的票呢?其实选股方法少说也有几千种，我想没有人统计过，我用过许多选股指标，不是选不出股票就是选出一大堆，而且成功率也不高。我说过我是个喜欢折腾的人，折腾指标、折腾预警、折腾选股，经过一些日子实践，针对超短线，总结出一套自己的选股方法，又快成功率又高，现用图文讲解公之于众，算是抛砖引玉吧

External auditors have a big role to play to ensure companies do not cheat shareholders by hiding potential red flags from the audit report.
If Serbadk can sue KPMG for trying to raise potential red flags then shareholders must also be able to sue auditors for trying to hide potential red flags.
https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/serba-dinamik-take-legal-action...

[Registration No. 200401006297 (644800-X)]
Explanatory Notes Pursuant to the Listing Requirements
For 12 Months Ended 31 March 2021
P a g e | 21
B3) Prospects (Cont’d)
Glove business
The Group has completed the commissioning of 3 production lines in Chemor Plant
during the financial year end 31 March 2021. Since then, the Group has further
completed additional 3 production lines and is now running 6 glove dipping lines with
an annual capacity of 0.88 billion pieces of gloves. The Group is currently building 4
production lines concurrently and scheduled for completion progressively between now
and end of September/October 2021. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, upon
completion of these additional 4 production lines, the Group will have a total 10
production lines with an annual capacity of 1.5 billion pieces of medical gloves.
Production and sales quantity is expected to rise with additional production lines
completed progressively. Thus far, the Group has obtained the following certifications,
licenses and qualifications: -
• CE Marking Certification - typically recognised in the European region for the
export of its medical examination gloves.
• Establishment Registration with Food and Drug Administration of the United
States (“FDA”), which allow the Group to export its medical gloves to the United
States.
• EN374 test standard: Protective gloves against chemicals and micro-organisms.
• Medical Device Authority license which allows the Group to manufacture,
distribute and sell our gloves locally.
• ISO9001 & ISO13485 certifications.
The Group is in the midst of applying 510(K) approval from FDA and target to obtain it
by 2021. Capitalising the above certifications and qualifications, the Group expects
strong demand for its gloves. The prospects remain generally good and the Group
shall continue to work with strategic partners to lock in commitments for the purchase
of gloves.
The Group has also completed acquiring a piece of industrial land measuring 72,770
square meters located in Kamunting, Perak on 26 March 2021. Depending on the
availability of funds from time to time, the Group intends to install up to 50 production
lines in Kamunting.
The Group’s venture into the glove business is expected to allow the Group to
capitalise on a booming segment with favorable long-term prospects and is expected
contribute to the future earnings of the Group as well as improve the Group’s financial
performance in the coming years."

I bought it just after they report the 100mil paper profit. Then I found out that they are going report 500M profit next quarter. After a month after that QR, I sold everything 70+% return before reentering again just before RI and sold everything again by feb.
The last dance was to consolidate for another rally. But they didn't exercise that move. So, have exit by all means.
Gtrade is clear case that Fintec group of related company are gang rapists. Yet the police who witness the events do nothing. What is SC chief doing? Why is he keeping quite? Pls come. out and explain to the hundreds of thousand of victims your position? Dont be a useless regulator.

SOME ADVICE FOR YOU:
1. Please don't give any conclusion about a company without knowing any basic knowledge of accounting or finance.
2. Some of the information or assumptions given was not true or misleading. Please do research for the true information.
2. Do you think that a company without any plans to do businesses is better than a
company which has a plan to do businesses?
What kind of THE BLIND PARROT company analyst you are. The cheap plug spammer. Haish
MY ACCUSATION ON YOU:
1. Infact, I suspect you have an ulterior motive.
2. Your analysis on certain companies looked bias, untrue and misleading. It's not fair to the company and its current share holders.
3. I'm afraid if you're one of the spammers who could gain much by spamming certain counter and speculating on the counter for your own sake.
I’m asking you a question. Are you holding any Fintec shares?????"

(b) Upon the expiry of the 6-month period stated above, the listed corporation must ensure that the promoters’ aggregate shareholdings amounting to at least 45% of the nominal issued and paid-up ordinary share capital of the listed corporation remain under moratorium, for another period of 6 months""... banyak condition lagi) Itu condition ambil dari Bursa website, tak tau ada laku untuk kes ni!!

BLee: Hi Sales, Someone started the acronym T.A.Y.O.R, I can only advised to escape at the purchased high price is to do cost averaging if you have the extra cash and think at 2.5sen is a good bargain.
As in the replied by Fintec to one of the media article, (link attached:
https://www.klsescreener.com/v2/announcements/view/3347657 )
""The Company’s principal activity is in investment of both quoted and unquoted securities"" explained the risk depend on market condition. The high profit could be because of 'bull market'. During 'bear market', it will be in the red. So IMHO, it is best to cost averaging during 'bear market'.
Happy trading."

BLee: Hi @whistlebower99,
PA conversion = 11sen or 11:8
WA conversion = 19sen
WB conversion = 10sen
WC conversion = 8sen
WA, WB and WC conversion NOT likely due to out of money; only problem will be PP and ESOS as per your warning on trading risk. Only 11PAs convert to 8 mother shares still possible, i.e. 254,308,135÷11×8= number of mother shares. PA anti-dilution, so no problem on any type of RI..
Agreed, warrants as good as 'garbage'. Not for PA as the 11:8 conversion still doable. My promotion link if you are interested: https://klse.i3investor.com/blogs/BLee_AGES/2021-09-12-story-h15714990...

'Raping' purpose: Details as in link, NEW ISSUE OF SECURITIES (CHAPTER 6 OF LISTING REQUIREMENTS) : FUND RAISING | https://www.klsescreener.com/v2/announcements/view/3415001
This is the 'raping' condition:
On behalf of the Board, Mercury Securities wishes to announce that Bursa Securities had, vide its letter dated 27 August 2021, approved the listing and quotation of up to 855,132,900 Placement Shares to be issued pursuant to the Private Placement subject to the following conditions:-
(i) Fintec and Mercury Securities must fully comply with the relevant provisions under the Listing Requirements pertaining to the implementation of the Private Placement;
(ii) Fintec and Mercury Securities to inform Bursa Securities upon the completion of the Private Placement; and
(iii) Fintec to furnish Bursa Securities with a written confirmation of its compliance with the terms and conditions of Bursa Securities’ approval once the Private Placement is completed.
'Raping' occasion:
Private Placement of up to 20% of the total number of issued shares of the Company:
1) 21 Sep 2021: 260,000,000 at (MYR) 0.0225
2) 21 Sep 2021: 40,000,000 at (MYR) 0.0225
3) 17 Sep 2021: 200,000,000 at (MYR) 0.0215
4) 08 Sep 2021: 100,000,000 at (MYR) 0.0199
5) The 'raping' will stop once the balance of 255,132,900 shares issued.
My opinion is NOT to lower the trading price so that the PP issuing price based on 5-market day VWAP will NOT be lower for each tranche.

If you look at Fintec, it is not dormant. It actively buying other plc stocks and actively issuing private placements and ESOS. How can their shares go to 1.5 sen? Their Net Worth per Share is now 36.26 sen. If their directors keep approving PP and ESOS to increase their Paid Up Capital and also there are ""People"" or ""Invisible people"" investing in these PP and ESOS, why should the price goes so low as 1.5 sen.??? No sense unless there are Directors and Management inside Fintec doing the magic to scam the Company's Reserve and share them to the new PP and ESOS investors. Even if the PP and ESOS investors are FAKE, still it is a good news to the Fintec as Fintec is getting more and more cash flow in into their Bank Accounts. OKAY, if let say, the Fintec directors and management team still are not satisfied to pushing the shares down to 1 sen, there is still 0.5 sen a share to push. Well, by that time, you all should buy as many shares as possible as this opportunity never happen before on Earth.

What do you mean by ""Only problem will be at least one quarter most likely few hundreds million 'paper loss' due to the Focus D investment retreated from around 65sen to today of 5.5sen still not accounted in any QR."" In another word, NTA of RM0.3626 is not true, right?
30/09/2021 5:38 PM
BLee: @KingDavid, the quarter reporting includes major investment of Focus D priced in the period end March (65sen) vs end June 2021 (4sen) beside other investments.
Below is an example of comparison of 2 different period profit/loss as extracted in one of Fintec report.
'(i) 12-month FPE 31 March 2021 vs FYE 31 March 2020
The Group’s revenue for 12-month FPE 31 March 2021 increased by 357.00% to RM93.10 million as compared to FYE 31 March 2020. The higher revenue was mainly due to higher sale of marketable securities as a result of higher value of trading activities undertaken by the Group.
The Group recorded a higher GP margin 54.96% in 12-month FPE 31 March 2021 as compared to 2.85% in FYE 31 March 2020 mainly due to higher gain from the sale of marketable securities.
The Group recorded a PAT of RM666.09 million in 12-month FPE 31 March 2021 as compared to RM226.03 million in FYE 31 March 2020, representing an increase of 194.69%. The higher PAT was mainly due to fair value gain on quoted securities held by the Group of RM620.00 million (FYE 31 March 2020: RM242.21 million) arising from the increase in market prices of such quoted securities:-.'
2. Focus Dynamics Group Berhad: fair value gain / (loss) (RM’million) 569.24
During the bull market, Focus D contributed RM569.24M in Fintec reporting (paper gain). I have expected at most, the contribution at bear market will be around RM500M (paper loss). Today QR reporting a loss of RM980.2M is a surprise to me.
As NTA is calculated with respect to period reporting; it is correct at the period of reporting. Usually this NTA is 1 quarter plus 2 months in preparation i.e. around 5 months from the previous actual NTA. Example: Focus D price at end March of 65sen vs end of June of 4sen vs Today of 5.5sen...Hope my explanation makes sense. Happy trading and TradeAtYourOwnRisk."

Afterall, The Accounting of Profits and Losses of all Public Listed Entities nowadays are all based on Current Market Valuation Method and not based on Historical Cost alone. Hope you all get what I mean.

BLee: Hi @Sales, Fintec Cash and cash equivalent as below, RM720.5mil only consists of 'paper gain' as at QR reporting.
Although QR30.06.21make a loses of RM-980.2mil consists of 'paper loss', the Cash and cash equivalents increased to a much healthier QR as shown (cash flow reporting).
Cash position during QR30.09.20:- Profit: RM720.5mil
Cash and cash equivalents: RM23.166mil
Cash position during QR30.06.21:-
Loses: RM-980.2mil
Cash and cash equivalents: RM109.996mil
When we invest in stocks, the timing is very important and QR reporting is almost 5 months behind time i.e. 3 months coverage and 2 months for preparation. We shall follow the current 'news' and counters shares holding; and NOT at old history. Please correct me if I make a mistake.

BLee: Hi @Howyoudoin, the lowest stock price is half sen i.e. RM0.005, not 0.001. It is a very long process if there is ground to delist a counter such as still insolvent after many warning to meet listing criteria. It is NOT due to stock price. Fintec is very cash rich at last QR i.e. cash of RM109mil vs market cap of RM78mil; meaning you can buy the ALL Fintec shares at 0.015 for RM78mil and getting cash of RM109mil in return plus ALL their holding shares of more than another RM100mil. Please see my calculation at: https://klse.i3investor.com/blogs/BLee_Fintec/2021-10-10-story-h159199...

BLee: AlexT12, you take care too. My investment shown in my portfolio still remain same, only loss in commission and taxes..Agreed some penny stocks are very hard to recover from years of losses. My advise is to read QRs and ARs of counters before throw our hard earned money. Find out reasons why the decline in stock prices vs business environment (balance sheet, cash flow, feed stocks prices, etc).
Two questions: 1. How can operators earn money in PP investment if the PP tranches prices keep decline by almost 10% since from Fintec tranche 1 to tranche 4 without any rebound of price?
2. How can money flow out (siphon) as money collected from PP, ESOS, SIS, RI are locked in bank FD account as shown Fintec latest QR reporting?
My observation is the operators could be accumulating Fintec stocks as much as possible with prices as low as possible. Retailers could only loss money by buy low and sell lower...
Finally, the operators could take control of Fintec with ALL the cash and holding stocks.

BLee: So far Fintec is very prudence in investing and cost averaging of shares holding in Focus D. The horse has bolted bringing along RM980mil, Fintec added more 'horses' up to more than 30% holding of Focus D. No sign of 'push high the price and sell later at huge lose'. When Fintec made a paper gain of RM720.5mil during 30.9.20QR, everybody seemed happy. The rolling 4Q only made a paper loss of RM170.3mil, everybody seemed to panic?? As reported in latest AR, Fintec is cash rich of RM109.996mil. See my article at link: https://klse.i3investor.com/blogs/BLee_Fintec/2021-10-10-story-h159199...

BLee: I am a shareholder for both Mother and PA, holding for long term investment. TradeAtYourOwnRisk.
29/10/2021 6:56 AM
Since I have a bit of leisure time, let me deliberate further how I invest in both Mother and PA, and why I am writing articles defending my investment.
It all started around 1st April 2021 when Focus D dropped from close to 70sen to 4sen. I saw it as an opportunity, and started to invest in Focus D-PA as the subscription price is 5.5sen vs market price around 1.5sen. My mistake was not buying Focus D as I would have in paper gain now. Then I spotted Fintec-PA favourable conversion ratio and started to invest around 3sen. Buying Fintec mother is for cost averaging since very low trading for Fintec-PA.
My writing of articles is to defend and share data I have gathered, not actually for promoting since I am planning to invest for the long term. There is some truth in those attacks on PP and ESOS, but not increase in share issuance. Each PP and ESOS needs to be invested in cash, only with around 10% discount. Please input comments if any, I am open for criticism.
Thanks for reading and TradeAtYourOwnRisk."

Agreed that, PP and ESOS might NOT be beneficial NOT only to retail shareholders, it should be to ALL shareholders...""无风不起浪"" meaning ""No wind will Not create wave"" i.e. Hopefully this new injection of capital can create new waves of income.
I am against PP and ESOS due to the 5 days VWAP price setting and usually at 10% discounted price...it might has other benefit such as interest free cash.
As I have post earlier, if WA, WB and WC exercise, the conversion will increase the cash coffer in Fintec (do NOT confused with Fintech in one of the posting of @PennyStock123: https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2021/11/16/bank-nega...

18/11/2021 11:54 AM
BLee: Hi, whistlebower99, many thanks for sharing above list. I am NOT a fortune teller, therefore I won't predict which next in line. Unlike PP and ESOS which don't involve shareholders, consolidation and RI do not necessary dilute shareholding/NTA. If investor do not take up RI, there is an option to sell RI-OR, I have done many times selling RI-OR if I don't intend to add capital.
On share consolidation, do not confused with market price and stock value. Market price is based on supply and demand, and also the future profitability of a company. Consolidation is meant to reduce supply and increase stock value, hoping to increase demand. Due to speculative and other factors, sometime market price don't work that way. The increase/decrease in stock value (NTA) won't change until the next QR/AR. Please correct me if I am wrong, BLee can take criticism as it is NOT the real me..haha.

Now, penny stocks just like a pure money game. Sadly, the authorities allowing this things happening. Goreng up one or two day shows to attract ""retailers"" into their trap. Then dump all the way down... most of these penny stocks issued right issue.. and what the fact is now most of these penny stocks fall far below more than half of their right issue's price...
is ok for trader to speculate penny stocks. Be strict to your plan. (CUT LOSS/CUT WIN)"

BLee: Hi @alex, the first part of PP and ESOS is quite true which I am speechless. The second part of dumping after buying high at super low NOT reported to the regulator as per requirements for major shareholders of minimum 5%.. Inaccurate statement and DON'T make sense.
Example: Fintec increase shareholding in Focus D to more than 30%, widely reported after Focus D drop from 70sen to 4sen. Buy high from market will benefit retailers and sell super low will benefit long term investors??

BLee: Hi @Dr Y.Raj, hope you have a very good trading day. I think you did the right move of cost averaging, especially for those who have holding power. In bear markets, ALL stocks seem to be 'kon' stocks.
A very balanced view on PP for info.
Link: https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2021/04/10/private-p...
Consolidation is NOT a problem as it only involves shareholders and no dilution involved. Companies that plan to issue PP have no advantage to reduce NOSH as PP issuance based on % of NOSH, will get less funding. This is the untruth portion of the half-truth. PP for 2022 will be reduced back to 10% of NOSH, I hope..
I am speechless on the ESOS, too many times!!
Happy Trading"

And how u can spot the kon loh!
LU TAU BOH ??
This fintec people do not know...how to run business well....their objective is to play the stock market and operate their stock to kon people loh!
If their stock operations are not successful....their next objective to strip the company for cash or strip its other listed for cash to bail them out loh!
For example U will notice that Netx will buy into mlabs loh!
And fintec will buy into netx & so forth loh!
Where is the promise of Running Netx as the next Alibaba, Amazon, Alibaba, Facebook, Grab and tencent leh ?
It can never be mah!
Bcos this people do not know how to run real business well for profit mah!
The best they can do is to cook up very sexy stories like when GRAB is successful, they will come up with Gemsports loh!
When Gloves is successful they will come up with AT loh!
The strategy is to entice u to get trap in their share mah!
Even if the stock that has huge undervaluation and Cash Rich like NETX with net cash more than its share price, it does not help loh!
Take for example for NETX....they bought up some of retail units in SG WANG Plaza for only token Rm 1................but after taking over the company.....NETX need to come up with millions & millions to settle the companies owing...b4 they can lay hands to any vacant retail lots mah!
So effectively...it is a bailing out of its cronies loh!
U SHOULD NOT TRUST THIS TYPE OF OWNER LOH!"

10/12/2021 5:57 PM
BLee: Hi @Potato88, hope a very good trading week ahead for you. Is the price of 0.05 already after 0.01 cost averaging? IMHO, you will never lose if you invest in strong NTA counters with spare $..
@whistlebower99: FINTEC investment game in NETX
Penny stocks speculating/investing in other penny stocks, a trend taken by many low-price loss making penny stocks companies
=================
Trade wisely, set realistic target
Monitor financial results, share issuance exercises, company investment in quoted securities
08/12/2021 12:05 PM
BLee: Hi @whistlebower, hope you also have a fruitful trading week ahead of you. A very fair 'warning' on Trade wisely.
From another angle, likewise, I would have cost average if the counter price had fallen so much compared with NTA..Value investing.
Example of recent Penny stocks value investing with good NTA:
Fintec at 1sen vs NTA of 8.72sen
NETX at 13.5sen vs NTA of 18sen
Seacera at 19sen vs NTA of 1170sen
Saudee at 6sen vs NTA of 17.46sen
GOcean at 2.5sen vs NTA of 6.33sen
The 'half-truth' on consolidation shall consider this value investing..Ratio won't diminish.
Another 'half-truth', money used in share market purchasing just supporting share price, won't be part of companies cash flow and can't use to buy other counter. ESOS, PP and others fund raising can only be used for specific purpose only, ALL regulated. How logical is the 'kon' theory?

BLee: Hi @M55555, you are absolutely correct, each ESOS/PP issuance get 10% discount and so many tranches. Which companies have zero borrowing? ALL Fintec cash coffer by 0% interest fund raising..but great NTA dilution as ESOS/PP don't involve shareholders.
Pros: interest free cash and no repayment
Cons ('kons'): Market price down and increase in NOSH
Short term speculators/shareholders will suffer. Due to market price down, those with cash can enter at low price, but don't know how low is low. My entry at 2sen already at 25 to 50% loss, just down by one or two ticks..easily recover if market hopefully improve.
