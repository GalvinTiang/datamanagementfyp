We also don't know how long it will take to bounce back, so do make sure company still earning $$ and able to give dividend with strong cash flow, business model is good prospect, and don't use margin.. only use your extra money to average down bit by bit.. and wait the good bargain.. then sell with profit..

行家建议：
TUNE保障首半财年核心净利报2870万令吉，符合预期，分别占我们与市场的全年预测的51.7%和46.3%。
该公司近期与越南其中一家最大保险公司Bao Viet签署数字合伙协议，在当地通过TUNEPRO平台经销旅游保险计划，估计将在第三季推介，可增加额外服务费的收入。
同时，管理层指已在4个关键市场推出实时的动态定价，结果令人鼓舞，次季占亚航集团（AIRASIA，5099，主板消费股）所有旅游保险业务的3%。
管理层透露，上半财年普险总保费按年跌1.7%，所以我们相信普险领域的挑战仍然严峻，尤其是车险，归咎于价格竞争与索赔率高。
因此，估计车险业务将拖累保费增长与续险率，主要焦点将落在旅游保险与非车险业务。我们维持财测，并保持“买入”和87仙目标价，相等于下财年账面价值1.1倍。"

Kuala Lumpur, 21st August 2019
2
The business portfolio restructuring initiative aimed at achieving the preferred portfolio mix of
Motor (30%) and Non-motor (70%), is part of the Group’s strategy to ensure the sustainability and
profitability of its Malaysian General Insurance business. While TPM prudently manages its motor
portfolio, it is also focusing towards growing the non- motor segment, specifically in retail, affinity
and small medium enterprises/industries.
Encouraging B2B Travel business cushioned decline in TPR revenue
Meanwhile, TPR recorded a lower quarterly GWP, down by 15% YoY at RM23.5 million, while
first half GWP was down by 17.9% YoY at RM46.6 million. TPR’s quarterly PAT declined to RM9.2
million (down 24.3% YoY) and first half PAT dropped to RM21.7 million (down 10.2% YoY). The
decline in GWP was partly due to the impact on the modification of TPR’s travel partner’s webpage
user interface and user experience design, though the real-time optimisation of travel insurance
aided in alleviating the overall impact, while the decline in PAT corresponded to the lower GWP.
Nevertheless, TPR saw encouraging EMEIA (Europe, Middle East, India and Africa) sales via its
Business-to-Business (‘B2B’) channel, with key markets like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi
Arabia registering compelling growths.
Overseas Ventures continued growth momentum
The Group’s share of results from Overseas Ventures was RM2.5 million for the first half of 2019,
translating into a 96.1% YoY growth. The TP EMEIA operations continued to see good traction in
its B2B channel while TPT enjoyed growth in the non-motor segment.
“While we recognise that the Group’s second quarter OR and PAT are lower YoY (on par if on a
normalised basis), we reiterate that GAIN is on track and poised to enhance our position in the
medium-term as a leading digital insurer in the region,” said Khoo Ai Lin (‘Ai Lin’), Group Chief
Executive Officer of Tune Protect.
Since the introduction of GAIN earlier this year, the Group has seen growing traction in each of
its four transformation pillars – (Go ASEAN, AirAsia ecosystem, Insurtech capabilities and
National business).
Go ASEAN
The Group’s business outlook in ASEAN remains bright with the successful signing of a
partnership agreement with BaoViet, the largest general insurance company in Vietnam.
Currently, integration works are underway in anticipation of the launch in 3Q2019.
The Group’s General Insurance business in Thailand has sealed the deal with TieThai to distribute
Travel Insurance with visa-on-arrival via its mobile application."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800002886.jsp?ftp=81","Oct 9, 2019 4:03 PM","Victor Yong","AirAsia Ecosystem
Since the implementation of the revenue optimisation initiative leveraging machine learning
capabilities in several key markets, the Group has started to yield positive results with the initiative
contributing to 3% to the overall AirAsia Travel protection business in 2Q2019.
The Group is also looking at other insurance revenue and optimisation initiatives on the airline
booking platform.
During the 2Q2019, activation of the AirAsia Travel & Service Centres (ATSC), one of the offline
channels took place in Vietnam, Macau and the Philippines, whereby Travel insurance is now
distributed by the ATSCs. Plans are underway to rollout offline channels in Thailand, China and
Indonesia in 4Q2019.
The Group will further align its structure to maximise and leverage on the relationship with the
AirAsia ecosystem in growing its businesses.
Insurtech Capabilities
Tune Protect continues to mark stronger presence in the insurtech space, having recently
established its insurtech arm, White Label. The Group expects to consolidate all its homegrown
digital assets under one roof, with White Label playing a vital role in monetising the group’s
technology assets moving forward.
The partnership with BaoViet is the first digital partnership where BaoViet will leverage on the
Group’s insurtech capabilities to grow its presence in the Vietnam market.
National Business
The Malaysia entity looks to grow its retail non-motor and SME/SMI segments. In May, it
introduced Business Shield which is catered to business owners and distributed by its agency
force, and in August, Pay-As-You-Drive was officially launched and is now available for purchase
through agency channel and online at www.tuneprotect.com . Soon, TPM will be launching a
new Motorist Personal Accident insurance product.
Forging Forward
The Group foresees that the economic and insurance landscape will continue to be challenging
in the region. To drive future growth, the Group will intensify its efforts on delivering its key
transformational pillars in ASEAN business, AirAsia ecosystems, insurtech capabilities andnational business to contribute towards underwriting profits and other incomes leveraging on
Insurtech.
In pursuit of being a leading digital insurer, the Group commits to strengthening its Insurtech
capabilities by growing key expertise and expanding the team, in preparation towards monetising
its digital and technology assets in the region.
“It is critical for us to strengthen the Group’s technology and Insurtech capabilities, as they can
help the Group to understand our customers and markets better, to stay relevant, and to compete
better in this crowded industry. Moving forward, we will be expanding our presence in ASEAN,”
Ai Lin concluded."

Entry of South Korean investor in Tune Protect could remove overhang, accelerate growth — UOB Kay Hian
Sulhi Azman

September 11, 2017 15:09 pm +08
-A+A
KUALA LUMPUR (Sept 11): The potential entry of a South Korean investor into Tune Protect Group Bhd could remove any potential share overhang, while helping the insurer to accelerate growth of its business overseas, according to UOB Kay Hian Securities (M) Sdn Bhd.
“Assuming that this news report is true, we view this positively,” UOB Kay Hian analyst Keith Wee Teck Keong said in a note to clients today, as the broker kept a “Buy” call on the stock, with a target price of RM1.40.
“As such, securing a strategic partner to dispose their stake to would be viewed positively by the market, as it removes any potential share overhang from open market disposal, and also helps the group to bring in a potential strategic shareholder who can add further value to help accelerate its overseas business expansion strategy,” Wee added.
Wee’s remark was following a report by The Edge Weekly, which had — in its latest issue — said a South Korean investor is keen to take up a stake in Tune Protect and consequently, could emerge as a substantial shareholder “soon”.
The entry of the South Korean party could be via the sale of stake by Tune Protect’s controlling shareholders — Tan Sri Tony Fernandes and Datuk Kamarudin Meranun — both of whom collectively own an indirect stake of 29.42%.
In Tune Protect, Fernandes and Kamarudin hold a combined direct stake of 16.64% via their private vehicle, Tune Group Sdn Bhd. Filings with Bursa Malaysia revealed Tune Group has been gradually disposing its stakes in the open market.
Since June 2015, speculation was rife that Tune Group was considering disposing some of its stake, as it mulls to review their broader strategic investment direction, while complying with the regulator’s directive in limiting individual shareholding limit to not more than 10%.
While the insurer is said to dispose part of its stake, UOB Kay Hian noted it will not “jeopardise the group’s crucial tie-up with AirAsia Bhd”, with the latter to remain a key shareholder in Tune Protect, owning around a 13.7% stake.
This, said the brokerage firm, was as Tune Protect had an exclusive tie-up agreement with AirAsia, which will expire from 2022 to 2027, helping to secure Tune Protect’s interest.
At the same time, UOB Kay Hian’s Wee noted AirAsia also places great emphasis on expanding its ancillary income, with travel insurance — through Tune Protect — being part of its long-term ancillary income growth strategy.
At noon-break today, shares in Tune Protect rose 4 sen or 3.45% to pause at RM1.20, valuing the insurer at a market capitalisation of RM751.76 million."

Tune Protect Group Bhd (TPG) expects a boost to its revenue growth over the next 12 months, following the rollout of its dynamic pricing optimisation initiative.
The initiative, which was launched in the first quarter of 2019, features real-time optimisation of travel insurance on AirAsia’s booking platform....
Unfortunately the reverse is the truth, revenue continues to fall and make sure management and bod remunerations move along the same direction.

2) Fire the Operations head, CIO and CFO - Please push down Management expense to <30% of GWP it's now 40+% .

Author: AmInvest | Publish date: Fri, 10 Jan 2020, 11:01 AM
We maintain our HOLD call on Tune Protect Group (TPG) with an unchanged fair value of RM0.62/share pegging the stock to FY20 P/BV of 0.8x, supported by an ROE of 9.3%.
The group announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tune Direct Ltd (TDL) has entered into an S&P agreement with LocalGlobe X, L.P (LocalGlobe) and Creandum V, L.P (Creandum) (collectively, the buyers) to dispose of its entire 9.99% stake in Laka Ltd (Laka) based in the UK.
The rationale for the disposal of its investment in Laka was to enable it to utilise the sales proceeds to strengthen its own digital and technological capabilities.
Its shareholdings in Laka will be sold to LocalGlobe and Creandum for £555,369.36 or RM3mil based on an exchange rate of £1: RM5.40. The selling price was derived on a willing-buyer-willing-seller basis.
Recall in June 2018, the group announced its acquisition of a 9.99% stake in Laka, an insurtech startup company which operates on a crowd insurance model to rival traditional premiums. Laka offers non-conventional peer-to-peer protection to members of a same community. The intention of TPG investing was to leverage the technological expertise of Laka to support its aspirations to become a leading digital insurer. The total cost for the investment back in 2018 was £499,478.07 or RM2.67mil and it was funded internally.
With a selling price of circa RM3mil, an estimated one-off gain of RM0.3mil is expected to be recognised in the group’s upcoming 1Q20 results which are trivial in our opinion. The transaction is expected to be completed by 31 March 2020.
The disposal of its investment in Laka is not expected to impact the group’s core earnings. Hence, we are leaving our net profit estimates unchanged.

GAIN compromises Tune Protect's four core business segments namely Global business, AirAsia ecosystem, Insurtech capabilities and National Business.

The share price of Tune Protect Group Berhad has nearly halved from a year ago; it was trading at RM0. 80 when I attended this year's AGM in June. Unfortunately, it's even worse for those who got in at the IPO price of RM1. 55 back in 2013.Jun 13, 2018
Industry: Insurance"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800002886.jsp?ftp=84","Feb 28, 2020 3:29 PM","Victor Yong","Already with a solid CEO now. continuous improvement since 2018 :)
Here are eight more key points I took away from the 2018 Tune Protect AGM:
1. Tune Protect targets to improve its combined ratio to 85% by 2020. The management has taken initiatives to improve the ratio by reviewing its pricing strategies and underwriting terms, and improving its cross-selling and claims operational efficiency. If the management achieves their target over the next three years, it will be a great improvement from the current combined ratio of 94% in 2017.
2. AirAsia contributed around 60% of Tune Protect’s bottom-line in 2017. As Tune Protect was appointed by AirAsia to manage their insurance-related products, it is not surprising that Tune Protect relies heavily on AirAsia to sell its travel insurance. The reliance, however, has been trending down (in terms of proportion) over the years as the company has ventured into general insurance, direct selling to consumers via TuneProtect.com, and partnering with other airlines.
3. Tune Protect distributes travel insurance through other airlines such as Cebu Pacific, AirArabia, Cambodia Angkor Air and, recently, Wataniya Airways. Tune Protect is also allowed to work with AirAsia’s competitors to create a win-win situation. This is a huge plus point as it allows Tune Protect to expand its distribution network. Obviously, no confidential data is shared between the airlines as some of them compete directly with one another.
4. Tune Protect intends to spend RM25 million over the next three years to become a leading digital insurer. The Minority Shareholders Watch Group wanted to know the breakdown of the company’s digital spending and the management stated that the budget will be spent on investment in technology, personnel, e-tools, InsurTech capabilities, and digital marketing.
5. Contract and insurance payables (free float) hit a record high of RM717 million in 2017, but its investment yield was a record low of 3.5%. This is an area where I believe the board should spend more time and, if necessary, revisit their investment mandate as the float has been earning relatively low returns over the last few years. I think there is large untapped potential for Tune Protect to earn a higher return as the management seems to focus only on the core underwriting insurance business.
6. The take-up rate for travel insurance averaged 14% for 2017. It is a good improvement as the take-up rate was in the single digits in the first half of 2017 after MAVCOM enforced the opt-in ruling. Without the bundling initiative, the result could have been worse for 2017. The management deserves big credit for turning things around despite the poor results initially.
7. No share buyback is in sight as Tune Protect’s cash balance dropped to RM7.5 million in 2017 from RM24.0 million in 2013. A shareholder suggested that the company consider buying back its shares as the price has come down quite significantly, but the chairman explained that Tune Protect doesn’t have the financial resources to do so.
8. Tune Protect seems to have high leadership turnover with two CEOs leaving since its listing. Razman, previously the chairman, eventually stepped in as the CEO after Junior Namjick Cho abruptly resigned as CEO in 2016. There wasn’t any mention about the sudden change of CEO in the annual report. My friend, Lawrence, was eager to find out why the company has such a high CEO turnover and how changes in leadership will affect the company’s business execution moving forward. To his dismay, the board seemed to dodge his question and assured investors they are not expecting a change in CEO again."

KUALA LUMPUR, 28th February 2020- Tune Protect Group Berhad (‘Tune Protect’ or
‘the Group’; TUNEPRO, 5230) posted a Profit After Tax (‘PAT’) of RM11.4 million with
Operating Revenue (‘OR’) of RM125.8 million and Gross Written Premiums (‘GWP’) of
RM114.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 (‘4Q2019’).
For the 4Q2019, the Group’s Profit Before Tax (PBT) and GWP increased 28.1% and
11.0% year-on-year (YoY) respectively. The Group’s PAT for 4Q2019 increased
marginally by 1.4% YoY to RM11.4 million while the Group’s OR declined 10.4% YoY.
For the full year ended 31
st December 2019 (FY2019), the Group’s PAT ended higher by
9.7% YoY to RM58.1 million, while GWP and OR reduced 10.6% and 11.5% YoY to
RM463.9 million and RM500.8 million, respectively.
Growth in the Group’s 4Q2019 PBT was largely driven by favourable prior year claims
experience, lower combined ratio and higher investment income. The Group’s
management expenses improved to RM35.0 million and combined ratio reduced
substantially from 101.1% in 4Q2018 to 88.8% in 4Q2019.
4Q2019 investment income increased 4.5% to RM8.8 million, while FY2019 investment
income was higher by 8.3% to RM31.5 million.
The Group’s strong GWP performance in 4Q2019 was driven by higher non-motor
business recorded by Tune Protect Malaysia (TPM), the Group’s Malaysian General
Insurance subsidiary.
“The Group’s commendable PAT recorded in FY2019 was a result of our GAIN
transformation strategy and ongoing efforts to improve operational efficiencies,” said
Khoo Ai Lin (‘Ai Lin’), Group Chief Executive Officer of Tune Protect.
Improvement in net claims and expenses fueled TPM’s PAT growth
TPM’s PAT increased fourfold from RM1.8 million in 4Q2018 to RM9.2 million in 4Q2019.
Likewise, TPM’s FY2019 PAT rose 61.8% YoY to RM34.1 million, largely driven by
favourable claims experience arising from our portfolio restructuring initiatives, lower
management expenses due to lower impairment and gain in investment income."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800002886.jsp?ftp=84","Feb 28, 2020 11:39 PM","Victor Yong","In 4Q2019, TPM saw improvements in net claims by 44.1% due to favourable claims
experience and lower management expenses by 28.8%. TPM also posted a 11.4% YoY
increase in GWP to RM95.7 million, mainly driven by non-motor segments.
Although TPM recorded decline in GWP for the full year 2019, its GWP mix is heading in
the right direction stemming from our aspiration to grow the preferred segments. TPM is
working towards achieving the optimal portfolio mix of Motor (below 35%) and Non-motor
(above 65%), as part of the Group’s strategy to ensure the sustainability and profitability
of its Malaysian General Insurance business.
Expanding our Reinsurance presence in ASEAN
Tune Protect Re (TPR), the Group’s reinsurance arm, recorded a 36.8% YoY decline in
4Q2019 PAT to RM6.2 million mainly due to the change in the intra-group premium
retention arrangements for its Malaysia travel business. The decline is cushioned by the
stronger performance from its three largest travel markets after Malaysia - Thailand, the
Philippines, and Indonesia, in tandem with the growth of its airline partner.
In 4Q2019, TPR’s business in Thailand and Indonesia posted a premium growth of 39.6%
and 34.2%, aided by the Group’s revenue optimisation initiative for AirAsia.
Lower share of results from Overseas Ventures
The Group’s FY2019 overseas ventures declined by 10.4% YoY from RM4.9 million to
RM4.4 million, and this was mainly a result of the switch to opt-in setting on the AirArabia
in-path booking platform.
The impact of the decline is cushioned by the 5.4% growth in travel business for Tune
Protect Thailand (“TPT”), on the back of the positive response to the revenue optimisation
initiative, in addition to the higher revenue from Tune Protect EMEIA’s B2B channels with
policies issued increasing a commendable 48.8% YoY.
In December 2019, Tune Protect EMEIA commenced its partnership with SalamAir, the
first low-cost carrier in Oman, offering travel insurance in four key markets in the Middle
East, namely Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar. There are plans in the
pipeline to acquire more markets in the 2020 expansion trajectory. Based on performance
to date, the Group is already seeing promising results, at this early stage. SalamAir
currently flies to 27 destinations across the Gulf Corporation Council (GCC), Asia, Africa
and the Indian subcontinent."

National Business)
Moving forward, the Group aims to strengthen its business by exploring more strategic
partnerships or acquisition opportunities in Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines while
growing its airline partnerships including the likes of SalamAir.
The Group plans to unlock further potential and synergies with its affiliates including
customer acquisition and cross-selling activities within the AirAsia ecosystem.
The Group is also looking at introducing a mobile apps with self-manage claims function
as part of its turnkey digital insurance enabling platform.
The Group launched several new products in 2019, including Auto Buddy, Business
Shield, Foreign Workers PA and the opt-in feature for motor insurance, Pay-As-You-Drive
(PAYD). For 2020, the Group aims to continue its innovation in developing new products
for consumers - including a new motor insurance product. It also aims to optimise its
distribution channels by targeting at preferred segments of motor and non-motor portfolio
while investing in technological capabilities.
Strong Fundamentals
In the near-term, though the COVID-19 outbreak has impacted the global economy,
particularly the travel and tourism industry, the Group remains cautiously optimistic that it
will regain growth momentum in the second half of the year. Several countries in ASEAN
have announced initiatives to cushion the impact of COVID-19 on the region’s economy
and particularly for Malaysia, the recent budget stimulus announcement to boost the local
travel and tourism industry will help to ease the impact of COVID-19.
The Malaysian economy is also not spared from the impact of the current political
uncertainty which is foreseen to ease once the new government is formed.
Notwithstanding these factors, Tune Protect believes that its transformation initiatives,
including the GAIN strategy which encompasses beyond Travel insurance and Malaysia
market, will help the Group weather the challenges in 2020.
“We have a good spread across multiple lines of business and our fundamentals remain
strong. We believe that the Group is in shape to weather the challenges and is in a
good position to prosper when the travel industry recovers,” Ai Lin concluded."

Outlook
The outlook of the general insurance business in Malaysia is expected to
remain very challenging due to the slowdown in business activities due to
the Movement Control Order. We believe insurance premiums may face
downward pressure due to weaker demand and higher competition.
Given that a large chunk of underwriting profit for TUNEPRO is derived
from travel insurance, the group is likely to continue suffering from the
negative impact of Covid-19 until, the pandemic is effectively contained.
Valuation

Downgrade to SELL. We are foreseeing a bleak outlook of the group’s earnings performance in FY20 where it could be potentially dragged by its AirAsia segment in the intermediate term due to the extended MCO throughout 2QCY20 and COVID-19 outbreak which has disrupted global travel. To recall, travel insurance has been the key profit contribution for the group (>70%). Moving forward, we are expecting that the reduced air travel demand and unfavourable claims environment to put further downward pressure on its revenue and NEP which could possibly result in lower underwriting profit as evidenced in 1QFY20. Note that the travel segment still accounts for about 80.0% of the NEP of its TPR’s businesses. We also expect the group’s underwriting profit to be negatively affected by the general insurance arm, TPM, due to the increasingly competitive landscape and weakening economic indicators. All in, we are downgrading our call on TPG to SELL from previously NEUTRAL.

Staying steadfast with Recovery Plan
KUALA LUMPUR, 22 May 2020 - Tune Protect Group Berhad (‘Tune Protect’ or ‘the
Group’; TUNEPRO, 5230) posted a Profit After Tax (‘PAT’) of RM2.8 million with
Operating Revenue (‘OR’) of RM122.4 million and Gross Written Premiums (‘GWP’) of
RM113.2 million for the first quarter of 2020 (‘1Q2020’). The Group’s PAT and OR
declined by 86.2% and 3.4% respectively while its GWP decreased 3.8% YoY.
The lower 1Q2020 PAT is a factor of the decrease in travel business, lower underwriting
profit and unrealised investment loss due to weaker performance in the fixed income
market, whilst the drop in GWP is partly due to a decline in its travel business recorded
by Tune Protect Re (‘TPR’), the Group’s reinsurance arm, aligned to the reduction in air
travel demand, and a decrease in the Motor line of business recorded by Tune Protect
Malaysia (‘TPM’), the Group’s Malaysian General Insurance subsidiary.
Reduced Air Travel Demand Weighed on TPR
TPR managed to record a PAT of RM7.8 million in 1Q2020, despite the challenging
business environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. On a YoY basis, TPR’s PAT
declined by 37.8%, attributed to lower travel demand in Asia and Middle East. However,
on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis, TPR’s 1Q2020 PAT was 26% higher.
Meanwhile, TPR posted a 1Q2020 GWP of RM17.8 million, a decrease of 22.9% YoY.
The decrease in premium was a result of the reduced performance of the Travel business
and the lower premium retention for the Malaysian market.
TPM and Overseas Ventures Impacted by Investment Income
TPM recorded a minor decrease in GWP by 2% to RM98.2 million compared to the same
period a year ago, mainly due to the lower Travel Personal Accident (TPA) and Motor
portfolios, partially offset by the growth in the commercial and retail Non-Motor classes of
business. 1Q2020 PAT decreased to RM0.5 million mainly due to unrealised investment
loss as well as lower underwriting profit. Despite the marginal decline in GWP for 1Q2020,
TPM is moving towards the preferred portfolio mix between Motor and Non-motor, a ratio
of 35:65."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800002886.jsp?ftp=87","Jul 28, 2020 5:18 PM","Victor Yong","The Group’s 1Q2020 overseas ventures recorded a share of loss of RM1.9 million, versus
a share of profit of RM1.0 million in 1Q2019. The decline is mainly due to unrealised
investment losses by Tune Protect Thailand (‘TPT’), the Group’s associate company in
Thailand, and the lower premiums from Tune Protect EMEIA (‘TP EMEIA’), the Group’s
joint venture company in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.
“The COVID-19 outbreak has affected many businesses and industries globally, and
Tune Protect was not spared. However, the Group remains resilient with a healthy capital
position and adequate liquidity to weather the uncertainties that lie ahead.” said Khoo Ai
Lin (‘Ai Lin’), Group Chief Executive Officer of Tune Protect.
Tune Protect Recovery Plan 2020
The Group has put together a comprehensive recovery plan to address the impact caused
by the pandemic. The plan focuses on three sections: Immediate interventions on current
business; Re-prioritise line-of-business, channel and partner diversification; and Expand
offerings and solutions focusing on the new normal.
Immediate interventions on current business: The Group is closely managing its
receivables and expenses as well as optimising its investment returns by planned asset
reallocation.
Re-prioritise line-of-business, channel and partner diversification: The recovery
focus will be on driving the preferred business segments of key agents and brokers
businesses, as well as expediting digital and affinity partnerships.
Expand offerings and solutions focusing on the new normal: New products and
solutions that meet market’s demand, particularly in areas that address consumers’
preventive, protective, and lifestyle propositions are in the plan. Together with its airline
partners, plans are also underway to expand travel protection to align with the enhanced
safety requirements of the travel sector.
“The COVID-19 situation has reshaped human behaviour with consumers preference
leaning on a more digital-led recovery. The new normal for the insurance sector will be
technology and protection coming together as a complete solution to customers. Despite
a negative shorter-term outlook, I believe that in the longer term, given our aspiration of becoming the leading digital insurer, Tune Protect is poised to navigate our way through
successfully in a digital environment,” Ai Lin concluded."

Since Tune Protect Group Berhad’s listing back in February 2013, we have consistently maintained a payout ratio of above 40%. We foresee this trend to continue as our business continues to generate profits year after year whilst our capital reserves remain sturdy. The current payout ratio is expected to be sustainable as we remain in a zero gearing position with adequate liquidity to support growth and investment initiatives moving forward.
Q4: Is payout ratio of above 40% Tunepro’s Dividend Policy?
Q5: Am I wrong to base on 2018 Dividend Policy and Q4 financial report announced on 28-FEB 2020 financial end 31th 2019 EPS of 6.74 cents and bought more Tunepro shares in expecting a dividend of 3 cents?
Q6: Is it fair to shareholder no dividend was declared for financial end 31th Dec 2019 when EPS is 6.74 cents higher than 2018 EPS of 6.59 cents?
Q7: Please allow me to remind BOD and management, one of Tunepro’s core values: Respect and Trust are at the core of everything we do. Trust is what bonding Tunepro with policyholders. Is this trust extended to between BOD and minority shareholders when come to dividend?
Q8: Will Management publish the answers to my questions in Tunepro website AGM minutes or email the answers back to me?

If you’ve read this far waiting for a “Rule of thumb” to value insurance stocks. Unfortunately, I cannot give you any. There are too many factors. It’s a lot more qualitative than most.
You need to judge the “Combined Ratio”, “Insurance Float”, “Cost of Float” and “Investment Return on Investment Float” over a long period.
As well as various qualitative aspects, such as the business, the character of the management, its track record, the leverage and other things. All of which are far from easy.
And if you’re done with the above. The general rule of thumb, is somewhat similar to most companies.
ROE needs to be high enough to cover the cost of capital. And assuming it’s a fairly decent one, below 1X book is probably cheap, and above 2x book is probably a bit expensive.
However good things are sometimes worth paying for, as I’ll show below."

It is understood that Tan Sri Tony Fernandes and Datuk Kamarudin Meranun are likely the ones who will be divesting their stake in the insurance company to the interested South Korean party.
The duo are said to have considered selling their stake in the insurance business for a while now. Back in June 2015, there were rumours that Tune Group Sdn Bhd — which is jointly owned by Fernandes and Kamarudin — was thinking about disposing of its stake in Tune Protect, formerly known as Tune Ins Holdings Bhd.
At the time, Tune Group was quoted as saying that the review of its stake in Tune Ins Holdings was at a preliminary stage. But the talk died down after that.
The largest shareholders in Tune Protect are Tune Group (16.64%), AirAsia Bhd (13.65%) and CIMB SI II Sdn Bhd (9.4%), a unit of CIMB Holdings Bhd, according to the insurer’s 2016 annual report.
Fernandes and Kamarudin hold an indirect 29.42% stake in Tune Protect."

Moderna's proposed price for a two-dose course sold to governments compares with US$39 for two doses under a deal that Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech struck with the U.S. government.
LONDON: Moderna Inc is planning to price its coronavirus vaccine at US$50 to $60 per course, at least $11 more than another vaccine from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing unnamed sources.
Moderna's proposed price for a two-dose course sold to governments compares with US$39 for two doses under a deal that Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech struck with the U.S. government.
Industry analysts said Pfizer and BioNTech's $2 billion deal to cover 50 million patients, which is contingent on an approvable product, would likely pressure other manufacturers to set similar prices.
Moderna's proposed price would apply to the United States and other high-income countries, according to the report.
A Moderna spokesperson said the company was in discussions with governments about potential supply of the vaccine, called mRNA-1273, but did not provide any details on pricing ""given the confidential nature of the discussions and contracts.""
The final price for Moderna's COVID vaccine has yet to be determined, a person familiar with the discussions told Reuters.

KUALA LUMPUR (July 28): Malaysia may get access to the Covid-19 vaccine from China, if the Health Ministry (MOH) finds it safe and effective for use, said Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI) Minister Khairy Jamaluddin.
He said this was part of the government's efforts to help develop a vaccine for the virus through scientific and strategic collaborations with countries capable of producing the vaccine.
Explaining further, he said the collaboration team comprising MOSTI, MOH and the Foreign Ministry was formed last April, to explore opportunities between Malaysia and other countries in establishing strategic joint ventures in researching and developing Covid-19 vaccine and medication.

The Covid-19 lockdown measures enforced over the last few months have presented an unprecedented challenge for small businesses in Malaysia.

Khairy said this was to enable Malaysia to gain access to the Covid-19 vaccine when it is produced, as the country currently does not have the facilities to make the vaccine for humans.
""Malaysia is also talking to China about the vaccine development by companies and institutions from the republic. China now has several companies and institutions which are more advanced in the field.

KUALA LUMPUR (June 29): Tune Protect Group Bhd has launched its enhanced AirAsia Travel Protection, which now comes with Covid-19 protection benefits and is available in both Single and Annual Plans for both domestic and international travel, for AirAsia guests.
In a statement today, Tune Protect said the enhanced Travel Protection is timely with the reopening of domestic travel and the discussion that has been initiated to reopen Malaysia’s borders to “green zones” countries as Malaysia phases into the Recovery Movement Control Order.
It said the resumption of the travel and tourism sector is in line with the efforts in accelerating the country’s economic recovery and reviving the Malaysian travel and tourism industry, which was at a standstill due to Covid-19.

The Covid-19 lockdown measures enforced over the last few months have presented an unprecedented challenge for small businesses in Malaysia.

“As AirAsia initiates domestic flights with new safety and health procedures, we have also put in place new and enhanced benefits to our existing Travel Protection, which include Covid-19 coverage to ensure ease and peace of mind of our customers during travelling,” said Tune Protect group chief executive officer Khoo Ai Lin.
The Annual Travel Protection Plan starts at RM56 covering customers for an entire year from the date of activation, regardless of the frequency of travel. Customers can also purchase the Single Plan coverage when they are purchasing AirAsia plane tickets or any time before they fly, it added.
AirAsia Group Bhd executive chairman Datuk Kamarudin Meranun said that while air travel remains one of the safest modes of travel, there had been an increase in awareness of the importance of travel insurance products in the last few months from the group's sales channel. This enhancement is a great complement to the various end-to-end safety measures that have been put in place by AirAsia for its passengers to fly again with a peace of mind, protecting them beyond flying.
""As travel begins to regain traction, we look forward to welcoming our passengers to fly with us again,"" he said.
The enhanced Travel Protection plan includes the Covid-19 Bereavement Allowance, Trip Cancellation, Daily Hospital Allowance and Compassionate Visit.
“Tune Protect understands the needs and worries of travelers since the fight against Covid-19 is still ongoing. With the enhanced coverage that comes with our Travel Protection, travelers can put their worries to rest when making their travel plans with us or through AirAsia,” Khoo concluded.
At the midday break, Tune Protect shed 1 sen or 3.03% to 32 sen, for a market capitalisation of RM240.56 million."

The travel protection products are specially designed for SalamAir travellers, offering benefits such as personal accident benefits, hospital allowance, emergency medical evacuation and repatriation, travel inconvenience and other travel-related benefits.

Khoo says the way forward for Tune Protect is B2B2C (business to business to consumer), a business model in which a company accesses its customer via other businesses.
“For any retail business to succeed, you need critical mass acquisition. Our key strategy to acquire this critical mass is to leverage B2B2C. This will be done through strategic partnership with corporate clients that have a sizeable retail customer base."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800002886.jsp?ftp=88","Jul 29, 2020 10:03 AM","Good123","More growth on the horizon
Looking ahead to the next two years or so, industry players expect further growth in the insurtech space. Khoo believes insurtech will continue to be a large part of the industry’s offerings, with strong support from the government and regulators.
Having a supportive regulatory direction is crucial as can be seen in the case of Singapore, she says. “The regulators have eased off in terms of regulations as financial services data can now be made available via the cloud. Though personal data is kept with the most stringent security capabilities, the use of the cloud enables flexibility and scalability for the business to grow.
“Insurtech players will continue to create and innovate to stay relevant in the digital space and cater for the growing number of affluent millennials and their demands. The use of technology, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, robotic process automation, data analytics and data modelling, to innovate and drive the business will be even more intense.”
Innovation will flourish in the development of new insurance products as the old-fashioned style of risk assessment based on generic data goes obsolete, says Khoo. The use of social media and mobile devices can provide large amounts of personal data that can help insurers develop better products.
Khoo foresees consumer demands evolving over the next two years. She says usage and behaviour-based insurance products that are lifestyle-driven will be the new norm, which consumers can easily access via digital channels at an affordable price. “Users will demand for enhanced customer experiences, with greater interaction, access to insurers and speedier turnaround times,” she adds.
AXA’s Tan expects to see more non-insurance or tech players operating with high user data volume coming into the market, with the aim of integrating skills and technology with insurers to offer a holistic customer experience or even selling insurance themselves. “This will necessitate the creation of a new ecosystem and data disruption in the industry — something that we have to progressively keep up with to ensure that we have the skills and capabilities to up our game,” he says.
Chua points out that while this year has been rather exciting with new entrants in the insurtech space, the industry needs an external party to rock the landscape and drive change, just like how Grab competed with Uber to disrupt the ride-hailing market.
“Grab is already doing insurance and it can expand to have a mini-insurtech arm under the holding company to focus on insurance. We need someone to stir the market because until then, consumers will not embrace insurtech products,” she says."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800002886.jsp?ftp=88","Jul 29, 2020 10:06 AM","Good123","The plans are essential for the group, as the travel insurance premium segment makes up about 60% of the insurer’s net profits and 30% of its gross written premiums (GWP).
“We will see a dip in earnings this year — it is what it is. However, as we are rela­tively strong in our capital and liquidity position, we are channelling our efforts into our recovery and digital transformation plan during this MCO period,” says Tune Protect CEO Khoo Ai Lin in a recent interview with The Edge.
While the travel insurer leader is unable to escape a dip in earnings this year, Khoo observes that things could have been much worse had the company not accelerated its transformation plan and launched the new initiatives last year.
In recent times, the group has expanded its product range to include comprehensive coverage for small and medium enterprises, marine cargo insurance and other innovative protection plans for motor personal accident. Khoo stresses that most of it is done digitally.
“It is a blessing that we had commenced our plans early on and this has led to a marginal decline of about 3.8% y-o-y in the group’s gross written premium in the first quarter ended March 31, 2020 (1QFY2020).
“The initial plan was that these efforts were supposed to be the ‘real incremental’ for the business this year, but given the current situation, it has also worked out well in helping to mitigate a further dip in earnings,” Khoo says.
She adds that the new initiatives have gained traction."

The group has been able to learn from the dynamic optimisation done for the travel protection segment and rolled out more on-demand, or lifestyle, insurance products.
“Dynamic optimisation with data analytics will enable us to further understand our customers’ demographic and psychographic profile to drive stronger engagements and target products and solutions based on their needs,” says Khoo."

We feel it is timely that we are driving a health and wellness strategy now. Mindfulness on personal health and well-being has been elevated and it gives us a better engagement with customers to look into their health needs and lifestyle protection.
“We are looking at a few combinations of areas in our health strategy that will be focused on digital healthcare services,” explains Khoo."

The eight-year-old startup said its funding round was led by a “global financial institution” and included existing investors, such as early backer East Ventures
SINGAPORE: Traveloka, South-East Asia’s largest online travel app, announced on Tuesday it had raised US$250mil to help bolster its operations amid the coronavirus crisis, and as domestic travel starts to pick up in the region of 650 million people.
The eight-year-old startup said its funding round was led by a “global financial institution” and included existing investors, such as early backer East Ventures.
Traveloka, which claims more than 60 million downloads, has been battered by the virus outbreak, as Southeast Asian countries shut borders and imposed strict lockdowns, throttling a previously booming tourism industry.
The startup cut jobs, with one of its affiliates, Indonesian hotel aggregator Airy Rooms, shutting down.
But as domestic travel restrictions start to ease in the region, the Jakarta-based firm’s chief executive said it “was seeing an encouraging recovery across its key markets” due to a resurgence in travel and activity bookings by local holiday-makers.
“Our business in Vietnam has returned to 100% pre-Covid-19 level and Thailand has surpassed 50% pre-Covid level, ” Traveloka co-founder and CEO Ferry Unardi said in a statement.
He noted that both Indonesia and Malaysia were also seeing “strong week-to-week improvement”.
Thai authorities unveiled in June a US$722mil subsidy to spur domestic travel, while both Vietnam and Singapore have announced extensive local tourism promotion campaigns.
The Indonesian resort of Bali plans to re-open to local tourists this week and to international travellers on Sept 11. According to Unardi, Traveloka will use the new funding to bolster its balance sheets and boost its domestic travel offerings as well as its financial offerings.
A source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that the lead investor on the round was the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), Qatar’s state-owned holding company.
A spokeswoman for Traveloka declined to comment on whether QIA had joined the deal or on Traveloka’s valuation.
QIA did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Earlier backers include US travel giant Expedia, Chinese online retailer JD.Com and Singapore state wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd. — Reuters"

KUALA LUMPUR (Sept 11): The potential entry of a South Korean investor into Tune Protect Group Bhd could remove any potential share overhang, while helping the insurer to accelerate growth of its business overseas, according to UOB Kay Hian Securities (M) Sdn Bhd.
“Assuming that this news report is true, we view this positively,” UOB Kay Hian analyst Keith Wee Teck Keong said in a note to clients today, as the broker kept a “Buy” call on the stock, with a target price of RM1.40.
“As such, securing a strategic partner to dispose their stake to would be viewed positively by the market, as it removes any potential share overhang from open market disposal, and also helps the group to bring in a potential strategic shareholder who can add further value to help accelerate its overseas business expansion strategy,” Wee added.
Wee’s remark was following a report by The Edge Weekly, which had — in its latest issue — said a South Korean investor is keen to take up a stake in Tune Protect and consequently, could emerge as a substantial shareholder “soon”.
The entry of the South Korean party could be via the sale of stake by Tune Protect’s controlling shareholders — Tan Sri Tony Fernandes and Datuk Kamarudin Meranun — both of whom collectively own an indirect stake of 29.42%.
In Tune Protect, Fernandes and Kamarudin hold a combined direct stake of 16.64% via their private vehicle, Tune Group Sdn Bhd. Filings with Bursa Malaysia revealed Tune Group has been gradually disposing its stakes in the open market.
Since June 2015, speculation was rife that Tune Group was considering disposing some of its stake, as it mulls to review their broader strategic investment direction, while complying with the regulator’s directive in limiting individual shareholding limit to not more than 10%.
While the insurer is said to dispose part of its stake, UOB Kay Hian noted it will not “jeopardise the group’s crucial tie-up with AirAsia Bhd”, with the latter to remain a key shareholder in Tune Protect, owning around a 13.7% stake.
This, said the brokerage firm, was as Tune Protect had an exclusive tie-up agreement with AirAsia, which will expire from 2022 to 2027, helping to secure Tune Protect’s interest.
At the same time, UOB Kay Hian’s Wee noted AirAsia also places great emphasis on expanding its ancillary income, with travel insurance — through Tune Protect — being part of its long-term ancillary income growth strategy.
At noon-break today, shares in Tune Protect rose 4 sen or 3.45% to pause at RM1.20, valuing the insurer at a market capitalisation of RM751.76 million."

In 2019, we established several key partnerships not just in
ASEAN but in the Middle East as well. Our success in securing
these partnerships was largely underpinned by our internal
product innovation and insurtech solutions that we offered in
addition to Tune Protect Re’s core expertise as a niche travel
and lifestyle reinsurer. Our longstanding partnership with
AirAsia and a solid track record as the exclusive travel insurer for
AirAsia testifies to our competency and cements our standing
as a preferred partner of choice.
Last year, we described our further foray in Indonesia via
a partnership with local underwriter PT Asuransi Buana
Independent as well as the Association of Indonesian Tours and
Travel Agencies East Java (“ASITA”). Travel agencies registered
with our partner can offer lifestyle travel protection products to
their customers via an online B2B portal called “Ayoberasuransi”,
that is powered by our proprietary homegrown technology. The
Indonesian market will be a key contributor to our growth plans
given the immense potential its travel market offers. By 2021,
the number of outbound travellers from Indonesia is expected
to reach approximately 10.6 million trips up from the 7 million
outbound trips in 2016.
Via a partnership with BaoViet Insurance Corporation
(“BaoViet”), we have laid the foundation for our expansion into
Indochina. BaoViet is the first non-life insurance company and
the largest financial-insurance group in Vietnam. Following the
soft launch of this exclusive tie-up in October 2019, we have
seen promising traction underpinned by Vietnam’s dynamic
economic expansion and the rise of its middle-class segment. In
the first phase of this partnership, we offered 3 simple products
to BaoViet’s own employees; Flight Easy, Gadget Easy and
Travel Easy. The next phase will be BaoViet extending these
products to its customer base of 17 million – almost 15% of
Vietnam’s population.
We also provide enhanced customer experience by introducing
a flight delay instant claims notification feature for BaoViet’s
travel customers. Travellers who purchased flight delay cover
will be entitled to a payout if their flight is delayed by 2 hours
or more. They will receive an instant claims notification on their
mobile phones requesting for their bank account details for
immediate remittance of the payout.
On 30 December 2019, Tune Protect EMEIA started a partnership
with SalamAir, as part of our expansion in the Middle East.
SalamAir is Oman’s first low-cost carrier that flies to over 27
destinations across the Middle East, parts of Asia, Africa and
the Indian Subcontinent, carrying approximately 1.3 million
passengers in 2019."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800002886.jsp?ftp=89","Jul 30, 2020 9:58 AM","Good123","Through our network of underwriters, we offer travel protection
plans with a host of benefits such as overseas medical expenses,
travel cancellation, baggage and travel delays, and personal
accident, through SalamAir’s online ticketing portal. The travel
protection product is currently available in 4 key markets –
Oman, the UAE, Kuwait and Qatar. Recently SalamAir launched
a new channel for customers to buy flight tickets and travel
protection via their call centre.
The initial response has been positive, and we are encouraged
by SalamAir’s aggressive expansion plan to penetrate new
routes within the regions that it currently operates in.
In Thailand, Tune Protect Thailand commenced its partnership
with Srikrung, a company that runs the online aggregator
platform, 724insure, and TieThai, the provider of an e-visa-on-
arrival mini application on WeChat for China tourists inbound
to Thailand. These partnerships allow Tune Protect Thailand
to diversify its distribution framework with its direct travel
protection products now available for purchase via their
platforms in addition to the AirAsia booking platform and D2C
website.
Another lifestyle protection product that was launched in 2019
is paragliding cover, where we reinsure the personal accident
policy for tandem pilot and passengers or students of licenced
paragliding operators in several locations both in East and West
Malaysia. We are starting to see traction in this space as the
interest in paragliding in Malaysia both for locals and tourists is
burgeoning. Going forward, as we secure more of these types of
partnerships, we are confident of capturing mass retail market
share amongst young working adults that are both technology
savvy and who better appreciate the importance of insurance.
Recently, we have also ventured into the nano-insurance –
insurance products that are small bite-size and low in price.
An example of this venture is reinsuring personal accident and
medical insurance with a Malaysian e-scooter start-up operating
out of Cyberjaya. The nano insurance element is bundled with
the cost of renting the e-scooter. The pilot launch for this
e-scooter rental service was done in Cyberjaya and around
the universities located within Seri Iskandar, Johor and soon
expanding into other universities around the country."

At the Group and our Overseas Ventures, we take pride in being
the forefront of technological innovation. We are constantly on
the lookout for the next breakthrough in technology or innovation
that not only can disrupt the market but also improve the lives
of our customers. With this in mind, we have established White
Label (formerly known as Tune Direct (M) Sdn. Bhd.) to house
all our technology assets, intellectual property and information
technology personnel. By having all these resources under one
roof, we aim to empower this technology arm to better support
our general insurance arm and reinsurance business in their go-
to-market strategy. We currently have a dedicated hands-on
team ready to handle matters from 3rd party systems integration
right up to troubleshooting system issues without having to rely
on a 3rd party technology service provider.
One such technology that has enabled us to secure most of
our major partnerships outside of Malaysia is our travel pricing
platform known internally as ZEUS. The ZEUS system is a robust
platform that is currently being utilised by our airline partners.
ZEUS has an API that allows integration with any operating
system that a partner currently uses. This makes ZEUS highly
adaptable as it can easily be integrated with a partner’s operating
system within a very short span of time. It is also a robust and
highly scalable platform that easily handles our current digital
policy issuance of approximately 28,000 a day.
Earlier this year, the Company completed the disposal of Tune
Direct Ltd.’s entire equity stake in Laka Ltd. for a consideration
of £555,369.36. Laka Ltd. is a UK-based insurtech startup that
currently offers peer-to-peer (P2P) insurance coverage targeting
high-end bicycle owners.
The decision to divest our equity stake is aligned with our
digital transformation strategy whereby the Company intends to
channel the proceeds from the disposal towards strengthening
our own homegrown digital and technology capabilities. The
price at which we disposed our stake was 11% higher than the
price at which we initially acquired Laka Ltd. – translating into a
satisfactory return on investment.
In the past year we have stepped up our performance marketing
initiatives to better understand our customers’ purchasing habits
and this in turn has allowed us to better craft our advertisement
messaging and content to drive sales conversions. Our marketing
efforts have significantly helped us to manage our marketing
cost better as we can leverage real time data of how successful
a digital advertisement is. In just one year we have seen our D2C
channel increasing its premiums and policies issued by 29% and
14% y-o-y respectively."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800002886.jsp?ftp=89","Jul 30, 2020 9:59 AM","Good123","AirAsia Ecosystem
The Group has a long-term strategic partnership with AirAsia
which extends beyond the airline business, to encompass
digital and lifestyle arenas, across ASEAN and the wider AirAsia
ecosystem.
One of the successes of our partnership with AirAsia was the
Revenue Optimisation initiative for their signature Tune Protect
Travel - AirAsia product. We commenced revenue optimisation
for our 4 largest markets; Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and
Singapore via AirAsia’s in-path online booking platform.
Revenue optimisation first explored multiple combinations of
content optimisation encompassing page layout, messaging,
and User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX) in March 2019,
before progressing to dynamic pricing optimisation in selected
markets, from June 2019 onwards. We executed multiple tests
to pre-determined segments to identify the most appropriate
product and price to the particular segments of customers.
We achieved an incremental revenue of RM2.9 million or 7%
of contribution to AirAsia GWP in these four markets for the
9 months of 2019.
The revenue optimisation initiative that integrates both the
platforms of AirAsia and the Group, provides valuable insight
to the travellers’ community in response to insurance product.
For the next phase of revenue optimisation, we expect to gain
even deeper learnings via more targeted campaigns, and we will
continue to improve our optimisation platforms and analytics
capability.
Offline is a more challenging channel to penetrate as it involves
coordinating and servicing AirAsia Travel and Service Centres
(ATSC) from various geographical locations, and this could prove
to be time-consuming and resource intensive. Nevertheless in
2019, we continued to make strides in opening up 5 new offline
markets – Vietnam, Macau, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Maldives.
Our AirAsia Bundled product that we introduced in 2017 centres
on the twin unique selling points (USPs) of Baggage Delay and
1 Hour On-time Guarantee. We have seen a steady increase in
sales performance in tandem with the rise of AirAsia’s premium
fare sales of Value Pack, Premium Flex and Flatbed. Going
forward, we look to expanding our range of bundled products
to a wider range of AirAsia’s passenger segments.
In 2019, the Group achieved several firsts in terms of product
innovation. We rolled out several innovative travel and lifestyle-
related products including an annual travel plan for the frequent
traveller, baggage protection, and gadget cover on smart devices
and also introduced value add-ons on top of our travel insurance
such as free AirAsia WiFi and DoctorOnCall services. In addition,
we introduced a Shariah-compliant Travel Takaful product
especially for the offline market of AirAsia Indonesia. Besides
the comprehensive travel takaful plan for regular travels, AirAsia
Indonesia’s Mekah/Madina/Jeddah bound passengers can take
up the Umrah/Hajj travel takaful plan which offers customised
benefits such as Badal Haji, Qurban and Wakaf.
Rewarding customers as they journey with AirAsia and the Group
encourages customer loyalty and allows us to deliver more value
to customers. In May 2019, we introduced free Flexiroam 1GB
high speed data roaming for 3 days. This service is activated
both via physical sim or e-sim and can be used in more than
140 countries worldwide. The free roaming service is available to
Tune Protect Travel – AirAsia online customers."

Distribution and Innovation
• Affinity partnerships
Collaborating with digital retail affinity partners is a key priority.
We constantly seek opportunities to work with partners that
have already amassed a large customer base from their existing
operations, or even with ambitious start-ups to build the future
together. We aim to create unique value propositions that can
either complement or elevate the partners’ existing offerings
and create wins for all parties. In January 2020, we are proud to
be the insurance partner for EcoWorld, offering three protection
plans to homeowners via the renowned property developer’s
community mobile application. The products offered on the app
include protection for Burglary, Smart Home Devices and Maid.
• New mobile application
We believe in investing for the future. With the increase in
mobile penetration in Malaysia and more businesses moving
into the e-commerce platform, our new mobile app which is
scheduled to be launched in 2020 is geared towards promoting
higher level of engagement with our policyholders. We aspire to
develop more lifestyle and on-demand pay-as-you-use products
that are easy to buy and convenient to claim.
In line with the Company’s vision of being the leading digital
insurer in the region, we will continue to explore and invest to
stay ahead in the realm of digital insurance.
• Agency Business
We will continue to strengthen the relationship with our valued
agency force to increase our market share in the preferred
classes of insurance. In this aspect, we will focus on enhancing
the partnerships and improving the quality of services rendered.
There will be more products and new functions incorporated
into our Tune Agency Online System (TAOS) to provide an
efficient business transaction environment for our agents. Tune
Protect Malaysia will continue to expand the agency force in
order to reach out further to the targeted market segments.
Sustaining business growth and profitability
We aim to achieve profitable and sustainable business growth. In
2020, our business strategies will be supported and complemented
with more new products, active pricing review, enhanced claims
management, and strengthened distribution partnerships.
Tune Protect Malaysia’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) has
increased favourably. This will allow us to embark on more business
opportunities to enhance shareholders’ returns."

feature in Vietnam via BaoViet. This feature has been well
received with customers providing feedback that the claims are
instantaneously remitted as soon as they submit their bank details

introduce this feature for AirAsia customers as well to enhance
their overall customer experience. We are also exploring the
potential of a flight delay instant claims pay-out feature whereby
once a flight delay happens exceeding the 2-hour timeframe, a
claim is immediately remitted to a customer’s e-wallet and a short
messaging service (“SMS”) is sent to inform them of the remittance.
As we look forward to launching our mobile application with buy
and claims functions this year, in addition to a revamped D2C
website that focuses on consumer experience, customers can look
forward to a refreshed user interface, simpler customer registration,
easy browsing, buying and claims submissions, and more. By
downloading this application either through the Google Play Store

The sheer size of its market distracts from the fact that when it comes to insurance density and penetration, China still ranks midfield in Asia, like Malaysia and Thailand.”
According to the report, insurers are being forced to adopt digital measures during the current pandemic that would otherwise have taken years to implement under normal circumstances. Client communications has been the key area of focus, with the lockdowns bolstering the popularity of online platforms and remote interactions. The applications have ranged from advertisements to real-time quotations.
The report says chatbots can be used to improve customer satisfaction by redirecting customers to the relevant departments. Text and image recognition can be used to eliminate human interaction, promote automation and reduce human error when filing claims while speech recognition technology can be used for authentication purposes and data mining.
“The increased use of analytics, automation and risk management will help the industry transform into a more customer-centric business. It will become increasingly important to create strategic alliances and partnerships to move away from being technology late adopters to becoming innovators,” it adds.
“Business strategies coming out of the crisis will make the insurance sector look fundamentally different. With the pandemic, we can expect a reshuffling of priorities in technology spending within the industry — not only at the product level or individual components of the value chain but across the entire value chain.”
Over the past decade, the persistent low-yield environment has continued to drag the demand for life insurance products in the global market, according to the report. In most cases, it has deterred savers from engaging in long-term maturing assets. As a consequence, life premiums have grown a meagre 2.7% annually in the last 10 years, with demand particularly weak in mature markets such as Western Europe (1.8%) and North America (1.1%).
“Insurers have changed their investment behaviour, with an emphasis on more alternative assets that earn illiquidity premiums and flexible product designs that allow for higher returns. Savers have recognised the ageing population trend and have realised that their retirement goals can be best achieved with long-term investments. Consequently, the life business rebounded in 2019 with a growth rate of 4.4%, almost double the previous year’s growth of 2.8%,” says the report."

HONG KONG: Sun Life Financial Inc expects Asia’s contribution to its income to rise to about 25% in five to six years, from 18% now, driven by its push to sell insurance products via digital channels and higher demand after the coronavirus pandemic.
The Canadian insurer has recently ramped up its digital capabilities in some Asian markets, helping it cushion the impact of a slowdown in physical sales by agents amid virus-related lockdowns, the president for Sun Life Asia said.
It would further bolster its digital capabilities to tap into a growing awareness of life and health insurance products in a region where insurance density is quite low, Léo Grépin added.
“We think that is, and that’s going to be even more going forward, a competitive advantage, ” Grépin said.
Sun Life has a presence in seven markets in Asia, including China, Hong Kong, India, and the Philippines. Insurance firms in Asia mainly rely on their army of agents for sales, but regulators are now encouraging the use of digital tools to ease the challenges posed by the pandemic.
Asia is a promising market for global insurers due to the low penetration of insurance and fast-growing economies.
Insurance premiums as a percentage of gross domestic product in emerging Asia-Pacific markets was 3.89% on an average last year, versus 11.43% in the United States and 10.30% in Britain, a Swiss Re Institute report shows.
While an economic slowdown and a drop in income has created near-term challenges, the pandemic has also raised awareness about the need for insurance in Asia, Grépin said.
“The awareness will stay (and) the economic side of the crisis will resolve itself, ” he said, adding Sun Life was already seeing a rebound in sales in China and Hong Kong.
Sun Life’s underlying profit from Asia rose 27% in the first quarter, with most of the earnings coming from before lockdowns were imposed in March, versus 8% and 7% in the United States and Canada respectively.

KUALA LUMPUR: AmG Insurance Bhd will acquire Kurnia Insurans (Malaysia) Bhd, a subsidiary of Kurnia Asia Bhd, for RM1.55 billion.
“This acquisition will position us to deliver on AmG’s strategic objective of being among the top three domestic general insurers. The combined businesses of AmG and Kurnia will emerge as the largest domestic general insurer and the market leader in motor insurance,” said AMMB Holdings Bhd chairman Tan Sri Azman Hashim in a statement yesterday.
AMMB said the purchase price translates to a price-to-book multiple of 1.99 times, based on Kurnia’s audited net assets of RM778.7 million. It is equivalent to a price-earnings ratio of 17.9 times based on Kurnia’s audited net profit of RM86.6 million for its financial year ended Dec 31, 2011."

leading e-wallet provider to offer insurance products via their e-platform.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, some local banks, insurers and firms have worked together to help further protect the community with different anti-coronavirus packages.
Since March 16, state-owned Bao Viet Insurance Firm provided financial support of VND20 million (US$860) for each SARS-CoV-2 positive case for the first one million Vietnamese citizens between aged 18 and 70 years old.
The insurance beneficiaries are people who are at least residing in Viet Nam for twelve months with truthful medical declarations, complying with the Government's regulations on pandemic prevention and quarantined methods and not infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus at the time they registered for the insurance.
The protection period was one month from the date of registration and time of registration was from March 16 to April 15.
The protection programme will be effective for those who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 by a medical facility. The firm will pay the financial support via Baoviet Pay e-wallet.
Together with Bao Viet, Sai Gon – Ha Noi Bank (SHB) started giving its individual customers who borrow or deposit at the bank nationwide the ""nCoV Shield Insurance"" package from March 16 until May 31, 2020.
Those customers who borrow or deposit from VND500 million at least a year or from VND1 billion in at least six months will be given an insurance package with benefits up to VND100 million. The package will also provide beneficiaries with VND100,000 each day in case of in-patient treatment.
In HCM City, Minh Bao Tin Investment Joint Stock Corporation, a private firm in the fashion industry also signed deals with the insurer firm of Military Insurance Joint Stock Company on March 16 for thousands of insurance packages which will be donated to the firm’s consumers and staff in more than 100 stores of Biluxury men's fashion nationwide.

AirAsia Group has been severely affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic. AirAsia temporarily
hibernated most of its fleet across the network in late March 2020 due to increasing movement
restrictions.
Since the end of April 2020, AirAsia has resumed domestic travel in Malaysia (29 April), Thailand
(1 May), India (25 May), Philippines (5 June) and Indonesia (18 June). We are gradually adding
frequencies and opening routes in the domestic sector, with the advice and regulations from
government and health authorities. Since the resumption of domestic services, demand has been
positive, with our load factors increasing week by week. Competition has also been rational in their
pricing.
AirAsia Group is looking forward to the gradual reopening of international borders in recognition
that air transport provides the connectivity that is essential for the resumption of economic
activities. The formation and discussion of “travel bubbles” and “green lanes” with key economic
partners with a low infection rate and proven pandemic curbing systems, is a step in the right
direction. The aviation and tourism sectors account for around 4% and 10% of world GDP,
respectively. Over 65 million jobs are supported worldwide in the aviation sector, while 1 in 10
jobs around the world is contributed by the tourism sector.
To ensure sufficient working capital during these challenging times, we have sought payment
deferrals from our suppliers and lenders. We have also restructured a major portion of the fuel
hedges with our supportive counterparties and are still in process of restructuring the remaining
exposure. This will help deal with the excess of hedged volume against expected fuel consumption
post-COVID-19 and reduce the hedging losses if fuel price remains at today’s prices. Further
measures in managing and containing cost include both the management and senior employees of
AirAsia Group volunteering a salary sacrifice, re-negotiating contracts and deferring all non-
essential expenditures. While confirmed initiatives so far is expected to result in at least a 30% cost
reduction YoY in 2020, we are hopeful of further cost reduction than 30% in 2020.
We have applied for bank loans in our operating countries to shore up our liquidity. We have also
been presented with proposals to raise capital to strengthen its equity base and/or liquidity from a
number of investment bankers, lenders as well as potential investors to help the Company weather
the storm caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, AirAsia has ongoing deliberations with a
number of parties for joint-ventures and collaborations that may result in additional third party
investments in specific segments of the group's business."

KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 3): MIDF Research has upgraded Tune Protect Group Bhd to “neutral'' at 27.5 sen, and said its share price had dropped to a level closer to the research house's target price (TP).
“Following a sharp 20% share price deterioration in the past month, Tune Protect is now trading at close to our target price.
""We raise Tune Protect to 'neutral' from 'sell', with an unchanged target price of 25 sen, pegged at seven times FY21F (forecast financial year ending Dec 31, 2021) earnings — at 1SD (standard deviation) below its two-year historical average PER (price-earnings ratio),” according to the research house's note released today.
On another matter, MIDF Research said Tune Protect had indicated that the downtrend in the travel segment bottomed out in April and saw a moderate recovery in the following months after the gradual opening up of the economy and uplifting of restrictions on domestic travel.
It added that AirAsia resumed operations on a staggered basis in June and is seeing a gradual increase in passenger seat bookings, though gross written premiums (GWPs) for the travel business are still significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels.
Also, the group has embarked on a cost-cutting exercise, which has seen Tune Protect Malaysia’s combined ratio reduced by 28%.
“This was mainly driven by lower management expenses (-31% year-on-year or y-o-y) as a result of reduced staff-related cost, reduced marketing expenses as the group re-prioritised marketing spend to campaign-specific targeted marketing, as well as enhanced receivables management. Of the measures, the reduction in marketing expenses accounted for the bulk (52%) of cost reduction in 2QFY20 (second quarter ended June 30, 2020),” it noted.
On Tune Protect’s latest results, MIDF Research said the group reported RM10 million core earnings for the first half ended June 30, 2020 (1HFY20), which were deemed to be within estimates — accounting for 54% and 49% of the research house's and consensus FY20 estimates respectively.
Last Thursday, Tune Protect saw its net profit for 2QFY20 increased 17.6% to RM12.6 million, from RM10.71 million a year earlier, despite a lower revenue amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Revenue for the quarter fell 18.9% to RM100.94 million from RM124.46 million for the year-ago second quarter.
GWPs fell 18.6% y-o-y to RM101.9 million, said Tune Protect.
The group attributed the improvement in its profit to Tune Protect Malaysia, which saw lower net claims and management expenses, as well as an increase in unrealised investment gains.
Meanwhile, the lower GWPs and revenue for the quarter were due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which affected the travel business, the group said.
Tune Protect rose four sen or 14.55% to 31.5 sen this morning after some 5.77 million shares were traded. Year to date, the stock has declined some 45% from 57 sen on Dec 31, 2019."

Just received from Tunpro IR:
Thank you for your email. Our 9th AGM, conducted virtually for the first time, went smoothly with all 9 resolutions approved by shareholders.
Similar to previous years, we will be publishing on our tuneprotect.com website the Questions received from shareholders and the Answers to the them (both the pre-submitted and live questions and answers). Do note that in addressing all the questions, we have grouped and paraphrased similar questions for clarity and to avoid duplication/repetitions. We expect to have the questions and answers published in the following weeks.
In the meantime, we are sharing with you the Answers to your questions below. These were read out in yesterday’s virtual AGM. Again, please note that certain questions have been paraphrased to be clarity and precision:
Question on Dividend:
Is it Tune Protect Group’s Dividend Policy to maintain a pay-out ratio of above 40%? What is the reason for no dividend declared for the financial year 2019 despite achieving higher earnings per share? Some shareholders may have purchased more Tune Protect shares in the expectation of a similar dividend pay-out to last year (3 cent) considering the better performance in 2019.
Answer:
Our dividend practice is consistent with what was disclosed in our IPO circular. It says and I quote “As part of this policy, we target for a pay-out ratio of not less than 40% of our consolidated profit in each financial year, subject to any applicable law and provided that such distribution will not be detrimental to our Group’s cash requirement.” In addition, any distribution of dividend is subject to our Group’s availability of distributable reserves, contractual obligations and capital expenditure plan.
Based on our track record from FY2013 to FY2018, we have been consistently paying more than 40% of our PATMI to shareholders in the form of dividend.
As you are aware, part of our business being travel focused, the pandemic impact has hit the travel industry the hardest as compared to other sectors. No dividend is declared for FY2019 as the priority now is to conserve cash to ensure the Group’s operational sustainability while having excess fund to invest in and strengthen our digital capabilities in order to adapt to the new normal. Despite achieving higher YoY profitability in FY2019, we are cognisant that the operating climate for the remainder of FY2020 will continue to be challenging given the uncertainties that lie ahead. In the event the performance of Tune Protect Group significantly improves, we may consider issuing special dividend or interim dividends in the future.
Question on AA Ecosystem:
What is Tune Protect Group’s plan to tap into the rest of AirAsia’s ecosystem (i.e. leverage on AirAsia’s big data and digital platform to cross-sell various insurance products)?
Answer:
The Group has a long-term strategic partnership with AirAsia which extends beyond the airline business, to encompass digital and lifestyle. As summarised in Slide 8 of our presentation earlier, we are pleased to inform that the Group has launched the following collaboration with AirAsia Group ecosystem (beyond travel segment) in 2Q20:
• Collaboration with BigLoyalty – BIG Members are able to earn Big Points when they purchase policies from us now
• Collaboration with airasia.com – We are assigned a dedicated Insurance tile within the AirAsia.com app/web to make our travel insurance products available to AirAsia customers
• Collaboration with Teleport – We are currently offering group policy to Teleport for its rider/courier provider with PA coverage
We will continue to work closely with AirAsia team to overcome potential regulatory constraints and explore opportunity to deepen our collaboration with their ecosystem, where possible.
Question on Management Expenses:
What is Tune Protect Group’s plan to address the rising management expenses as a percentage of topline over the years as well as the elevated Combined Ratio? Will Tune Protect Group relook at the cost structure to expect a leaner operation, advertising, marketing expenses and its efficacy due to high management expenses? Kindly advise on how you manage your pricing in selection of IT vendors with regards to digital solutions?
Answer:
In FY19, the absolute amount of ME reduced from RM134.6 mil in FY18 to RM119.8 mil. The increase in ME in the past was largely due to our investment in human capital, IT, marketing expenses to support our business growth and digital agenda. However, the ME ratio increased because the drop in Net Earned Premiums was more.
Our ME ratio is computed as a percentage of ME over NEP. The higher ME ratio is largely due to lower NEP which is underpinned by our on-going portfolio restructuring (managing motor: non-motor portfolio mix)."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800002886.jsp?ftp=91","Aug 5, 2020 2:02 PM","Sslee","We have embarked on ME review where we are looking at spending more efficiently. Recent measures include, freeze new and replacement hire unless it is for critical roles, reprioritising marketing spend and reduction in office rental, 3rd party consultants and other office expenses.
Apart from ME, we are also managing our claims prudently. Our net claims ratio was 32.3% in 2019 which was 1.9% lower compared to the previous year. Our net claims ratio is also 25.8% lower compared to the industry. Over time we want to see these improvements translate into a lower combined ratio for the group.
Our IT vendor selection process goes through a robust and rigorous process. It starts with the RFP process to identify and shortlist the suitable vendors. This is followed by a review by the procurement committee. During this stage, the committee does not solely consider the pricing per se but also evaluates the vendor’s credentials, experience and track record. Once selected we then conduct a thorough due diligence on the vendor before awarding the tender.
Kind regards,
The Investor Relations team"

One of my concerns is the frequent change of Group CEOs in the company since the IPO. I remember a great presentation by the immediate past Group CEO during the AGM last year. However, she has now resigned after less than 2 years at the helm, and thus not having to account to shareholders at this year's AGM on the implementation of the strategies and plans that she presented at the AGM last year. Hope the BOD is seriously addressing this issue.

Tune IR reply to my further clarification:
Dear Mr. Lee,
We acknowledge receipt of your questions below requesting further clarification. Kindly note that we will compile the responses to your questions as well as those from our other shareholders which will then be published in our website in due course. We will update you once it is available on our website.
Thanks & regards,
The Investor Relations team
Dear Tunepro IR,
Thank you for sharing with me the answer to my pre-submitted questions with paraphrased clarity and precision.
I had studied the answers given and I think I need to further clarify with the Board or management team on some of the essence of my original questions.
Investment in fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) financial assets. Allow me to paraphrase:
Question 1: Any organization or governance structure in place to oversee and manage the investment holding function of the Group?
Question 2: Is there an investment committee to meet periodically to evaluate the performance of the investments and whether the investing strategies meet the investment objective? And any policy to cut loss on underperformed investment?
Dividend
Allow me to quote the Board reply, “Our dividend practice is consistent with what was disclosed in our IPO circular. It says and I quote “As part of this policy, we target for a pay-out ratio of not less than 40% of our consolidated profit in each financial year, subject to any applicable law and provided that such distribution will not be detrimental to our Group’s cash requirement.” In addition, any distribution of dividend is subject to our Group’s availability of distributable reserves, contractual obligations and capital expenditure plan.” unquote
So please allow me to paraphrase:
Will the distribution of dividend for financial year end 2019 result in:
1. Against any applicable law?
2. Detrimental to the Group's cash requirement?
3. Against the Group's availability of distribution reserves?
4. Against contractual obligation and capital expenditure plan?
On AA Ecosystem:
Please allow me to paraphrase:
Any plan by Tunepro to leverage AirAsia big data and digital platform to cross sell: Health, Life, Saving and Education policies online to targeted groups?
I am looking forward to the Board or Management team clarification.
Thank you
Best Regards"

Rohit Nambiar here. I joined Tune Group as the Group CEO around 8-weeks back. I am excited by the opportunity it presents.
Currently, I am in the process of listening to different stakeholders - from customers to employees, from distributors to partners and from Analysts to investors. In this regard, it is my pleasure to be here and see some of your comments first hand above. This helps us in formulating the right strategy.
Meanwhile, here is a link to an interview I had done just before joining Tune. This covers my general views on insurance, disruption, consumer experience and the like
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qMY2mlwxiQ
I hope to meet some of you at the investor meets or at the AGM.
Stay safe.
Regards,
Rohit"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800002886.jsp?ftp=92","Dec 7, 2020 3:11 PM","Sslee","Dear Rohit Nambiar,
Welcome to Malaysia and Tunepro.
I am glad that your are prepare to engage with shareholders in this i3ivestor forum.
Below are some of the questions I submitted in advance for Tunepro 9th AGM.
I felt the answers given by the Board was not very satisfactory and I would like you to have a second look into my questions.
Dear Tunepro IR,
Thank you for sharing with me the answer to my pre-submitted questions with paraphrased clarity and precision.
I had studied the answers given and I think I need to further clarify with the Board or management team on some of the essence of my original questions.
Investment in fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) financial assets. Allow me to paraphrase:
Question 1: Any organization or governance structure in place to oversee and manage the investment holding function of the Group?
Question 2: Is there an investment committee to meet periodically to evaluate the performance of the investments and whether the investing strategies meet the investment objective? And any policy to cut loss on underperformed investment?
My original question on Dividend policy:
Refer Dividend Policy stated on 2018 annual report page (22):
Since Tune Protect Group Berhad’s listing back in February 2013, we have consistently maintained a payout ratio of above 40%. We foresee this trend to continue as our business continues to generate profits year after year whilst our capital reserves remain sturdy. The current payout ratio is expected to be sustainable as we remain in a zero gearing position with adequate liquidity to support growth and investment initiatives moving forward.
Q4: Is payout ratio of above 40% Tunepro’s Dividend Policy?
Q5: Am I wrong to base on 2018 Dividend Policy and Q4 financial report announced on 28-FEB 2020 financial end 31th 2019 EPS of 6.74 cents and bought more Tunepro shares in expecting a dividend of 3 cents?
Q6: Is it fair to shareholder no dividend was declared for financial end 31th Dec 2019 when EPS is 6.74 cents higher than 2018 EPS of 6.59 cents?
Q7: Please allow me to remind BOD and management, one of Tunepro’s core values: Respect and Trust are at the core of everything we do. Trust is what bonding Tunepro with policyholders. Is this trust extended to between BOD and minority shareholders when come to dividend?
Answer:
Our dividend practice is consistent with what was disclosed in our IPO circular. It says and I quote “As part of this policy, we target for a pay-out ratio of not less than 40% of our consolidated profit in each financial year, subject to any applicable law and provided that such distribution will not be detrimental to our Group’s cash requirement.” In addition, any distribution of dividend is subject to our Group’s availability of distributable reserves, contractual obligations and capital expenditure plan.
Based on our track record from FY2013 to FY2018, we have been consistently paying more than 40% of our PATMI to shareholders in the form of dividend.
As you are aware, part of our business being travel focused, the pandemic impact has hit the travel industry the hardest as compared to other sectors. No dividend is declared for FY2019 as the priority now is to conserve cash to ensure the Group’s operational sustainability while having excess fund to invest in and strengthen our digital capabilities in order to adapt to the new normal. Despite achieving higher YoY profitability in FY2019, we are cognisant that the operating climate for the remainder of FY2020 will continue to be challenging given the uncertainties that lie ahead. In the event the performance of Tune Protect Group significantly improves, we may consider issuing special dividend or interim dividends in the future.
After received the above answers I wrote in:
So please allow me to paraphrase:
Will the distribution of dividend for financial year end 2019 result in:
1. Against any applicable law?
2. Detrimental to the Group's cash requirement?
3. Against the Group's availability of distribution reserves?
4. Against contractual obligation and capital expenditure plan?
On AA Ecosystem:
Please allow me to paraphrase:
Any plan by Tunepro to leverage AirAsia big data and digital platform to cross sell: Health, Life, Saving and Education policies online to targeted groups?
I am looking forward to the Board or Management team clarification.
Best Regards
SS LEE"

Dear Rohit,
Wanted to clarify some rumours around the international digital ID/Passport which the IATA is working on with insurance companies, airlines and governments to enable vaccinated persons to be registered along with their credentials and travel insurance information, allowing them to travel across boarders.
Considering the links to airasia and many other international airlines, esp in the middle East, is tunepro aligning with such an initiative? It would certainly be a important enabler to future profit streams for the next 3 years at least..."

Unfortunately at this level, no big sellers, to buy 2 to 3 mil shares, the price jumps up quite fast 4 to 5 sen...
Anyway what is interesting is the latest stunt by Tony for his SPAC in the US, digital platform. There is a play for tune leaning towards digital and shorter/smaller coverage... Insure as you need type of biz. If they need to prove platform or physical business acquisition, a chunk of tune could be the play.
Anyhow the growth going forward with escalating healthcare cost would spook many to pickup insurance coverage.

AirAsia says over 20 new airlines have joined Super App
TheEdge Thu, Oct 28, 2021 12:05pm - 47 minutes
KUALA LUMPUR (Oct 28): AirAsia Group Bhd has partnered with more than 20 airlines as it builds up its Super App into an online travel agency that also sells flights by competitors, the budget airline said on Thursday.
The airlines which have joined airasia Super App as partners include Air Canada, Air France, Bamboo Airways, flydubai, KLM, Qatar Airways, and Philippine Airlines.
AirAsia said the app has more than 700 airline partners and can reach over 3,000 destinations. It partnered Kiwi.com in 2019, a travel tech firm that allows users to build itineraries to combine flights and ground transportation from more than 800 carriers.
The new partnerships come as international travel gradually reopens after more than a year of slump due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
""We see a strong V-shape recovery in the coming months,"" airasia Super App chief executive officer Amanda Woo said at a briefing.
Woo said the app aims to capture a 30% market share and become the top Southeast Asian online travel agency in five years. It competes with online travel agencies like Agoda and Traveloka.
Through the collaborations, AirAsia will offer travel deals to more destinations outside its network across Europe, Oceania, Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas."

investment income.
Profit before tax of the Group decreased by RM20.1 million from RM20.3 million 2Q21 to
