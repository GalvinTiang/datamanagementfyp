Cement contributed a lot of profit to CMSB. However, CMSB managed to invest in another business, I think it is related to energy. They made losses until last year, this project became a money making machine. Last year it contributed about 80 million in profit. Looking ahead, CMSB is hoping to double their profit in the next few years. They also weaned off TPS which never made any money."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000495.jsp?ftp=84","Jul 29, 2019 4:25 PM","value88","CMSB drops probably due to management guided that the performance of OM Materials is going to be weak for FY2019 due to weakening selling prices for FeSi. OM Materials' contribution has been quite substantial in FY18, thus if OM Materials is to perform weaker, it will impact CMSB's FY19 earning performance.

If u refer to announcements, the major shareholder has been buying CMSB stocks from end May19 till yesterday. This doesn't mean everything but it at least shows a positive sign that things may not be so bad as what market has thought for CMSB.
Having said that, take note that its associate, i.e. OM Materials, performance will be poor in quarters to come due to declining FeSi selling price.

Infrastructure and Ports Development Minister Tan Sri Dr James Jemut Masing said these bridges will be built across Batang Rambungan, Batang Lupar, Batang Saribas, Sungai Krian, Batang Paloh, Muara Lassa and Batang Igan.
The second component is to provide the “missing link” along Jalan Pasi, Sarikei/Tanjung Manis, Mukah, and involves the Batang Rajang Bridge, construction of the Kuala Kemena/Jepak Bridge and a proposed second alignment for Jalan Kuching/Samarahan which includes the construction of a bridge across Sungai Sarawak at Demak Laut.
“The third component involves the upgrading of the existing coastal road under two packages, A & B, with 23 sub-packages, 13 and 10 respectively,” he said during the Questions for Oral Answers session in the assembly.
Masing, who is a deputy chief minister, was replying to a question from Yussibnosh Balo (GPS-Tellian), who had wanted to know the progress of the construction of the coastal road.
Masing said four of the seven packages of the first component have been offered to contractors, namely the Batang Saribas Bridge (estimated cost of RM496 million); Sungai Krian Bridge (RM174 million); Batang Paloh Bridge (RM567 million) and Muara Lassa Bridge (RM665 million).
“The letter for the second component — Jalan Pasi, Sarikei/Tanjung Manis, Mukah, and the Batang Rajang Bridge — was issued on Feb 22 for a contract valued at RM321,377,700.
“The letter for the construction of the Kuala Kemena/Jepak Bridge was issued on March 6 for a contract valued at RM466,679,497 while the second road from Samarahan to Kuching via Jalan Tanjung Bako and the construction of Bako/Buntal Link Road, including the construction of a bridge across Sungai Buntal, is in the early design phase,” he said.
Masing said that for the third component, the sub-package involving the 9.6-km alignment between Kampung Sungai Bulug/Sebuyau has been offered while the tender documents were being processed for the remaining 12 sub-packages.
Another sub-package, involving the 12.3km Tanjung Kidurong/Kuala Suai/Kuala Niah/Kuala Sibuti/Bakam Road, has also been offered while the remaining nine sub-packages are at the stage of site study and design, he said."

Author: savemalaysia | Publish date: Sat, 16 Nov 2019, 8:58 PM
KUCHING, Nov 16 — Chief Minister Datuk Patinggi Abang Johari Openg today said that the state government has spent RM37.1 billion while the federal government allocated RM20.4 billion for development projects in Sarawak under the five-year 11th Malaysia Plan (11MP).
He said under 12MP, which will start in 2021, the state government will allocate more funds for development, focusing on infrastructures and agriculture.
“Some people thought we will go bankrupt if we spend more funds for development. I can tell you that we will not go bankrupt. Today, we still have our reserve totaling RM32 billion, an increase from the previous year,” he said at the inaugural GPS Convention at the Borneo Convention Centre Kuching (BCCK) here.
He said there are people who claimed that Sarawak would crawl to beg for funds after a change in the federal government following the defeat of the Barisan Nasional (BN) in the 14th general election last year.
“They thought Sarawak would go bankrupt within three years without the financial support from the Pakatan Harapan (PH) federal government.
“But we are not that stupid. We have the funds. This year, we budgeted RM10 billion and another RM10 billion for next year for our development expenditures,” he said.
The chief minister told the 5,000 delegates in attendance that the state government has ways to generate revenue for development funds, including imposing sales tax on oil and gas exports.
“We also have a 25 per cent equity investment in LGP Tiga Plant in Bintulu which gives us about RM2 billion in revenue annually,” he said.
“I can tell you that if Petronas fails to pay us the sales tax, we have other sources of revenue for our development.
“We have the state-owned Development Bank of Sarawak (DBoS) which can help us with the funds.
“We have big reserves deposited in banks in the country. We have taken some of our reserves in these banks and transferred it to DBoS.
“With these funds in DBoS, we will obtain the loans to finance our infrastructures, like bridges and roads,” he said.
Among those present at the convention were leaders from the four GPS component parties, PBB, SUPP, PRS and PDP.

Good
At least Molly Ngui clever to buy and made some money here
So many naysayers wasted so much time & energy trying to talk down Netx to half sen in futile effort
Now let Calvin tells you his experience from REAL LIFE
In years 2007 to 2008 I bought Opcom. After buying 10,000 shares Opcom at
Rm1.00 each for RM10,000 it crashed to my horror all the way to 30 sen
But knowing that Malaysia is in its infancy regarding fiber optic future I bought all the way down till I had a total of 400,000 shares with average price around 40 sen to 45 sen
Then Opcom rebounded to 40 sen, still below my buying price 45 sen (after averaging from 10 lots to 400 lots)
Suddenly one day Opcom jumped from 42 sen to 48 sen above my holding cost of 45 sen. So I got itchy and sold a little at 47 sen to 48 sen (I didn't know why Opcom spiked up)
Next day Opcom announced Rm359 Millions Job award from Telekom
See
Announcementhttp://www.bursamalaysia.com/market/listed-companies/company-announcem...
Subject Letter of Award for the Supply, Delivery, Training and Support Services of Passive FTTH System to Telekom Malaysia Berhad
Contents Introduction
The Board of Directors of Opcom Holdings Berhad (""the Company"") wishes to announce that its subsidiary, Opcom Cables Sdn Bhd has on 21st April 2009 received a Letter of Award amounting to RM359 million from Telekom Malaysia Berhad (""Telekom"") for the supply, delivery, training and support services of Passive FTTH System to Telekom for a period of two (2) years (""Award"").
AT THIS NEWS OF JOB AWARD FROM TELEKOM OPCOM WENT LIMIT UP RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES FROM 48 SEN TO REACH 70 SEN AND THEN PEOPLE STARTED SELLING TO TAKE PROFIT
(SO CALLED EXPERT ADVISE (WRONG) BUY ON RUMOUR AND SELL ON NEWS)
SO I SOLD THE MAJORITY OF MY OPCOM SHARES FROM 70 SEN AS IT WEAKENED DOWN TO 63 SEN
OF COURSE I MADE GOOD MONEY IN OPCOM. BUT I SHOULD HAVE HELD ON FOR OPTIMAL GAIN
THEN OPCOM DECLARED A SPECIAL 22.5 SEN CASH PAYOUT
See
29-Aug-2011 14-Sep-2011 DIVIDEND Special Dividend RM 0.225
AT THE ASTOUNDING NEWS OF 22.5 SEN SPECIAL DIVIDEND OPCOM GONE LIMIT UP THE 2ND TIME TO CROSS RM1.00
SO TAKE CALVIN'S ADVISE
DON'T FOOL AROUND AND PLAY PLAY WITH NFCP FIBERISATION STOCKS LIKE OPCOM, NETX, REDTONE AND ALSO SACOFA (CMSB)
JUST BUY AND HOLD ON TO IT TIGHTLY COME WHAT MAY TILL JOB AWARD & FINAL RESULT OUT THEN ONLY SEE IF YOU WANT TO TAKE PROFIT OR STILL HOLD
KINDEST REGARDS

“For the observers, it would seem that nothing is moving. Rome was not built in one day. When Malaysia was switching from an agro-based economy to an industrial economy, it also took time.
“But most of us could not remember and the young never saw the transition. Most were born when the transition was accomplished. It is difficult to imagine an agricultural Malaysia today.”
The same will happen now. The transition will take time — perhaps two years or more from now.
“But believe me it will happen. Indeed in some ways, it is already happening. We are going paperless and soon there will be cashless. Digitalisation is already happening and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is contributing towards increasing speed of work and transaction.”
Dr Mahathir said it is frustrating to wait, even for him.

As year 2020 unfolds we now see more and more clarity
1. Nfcp fiberisation was the brainchild of Tun Dr M with full support of Ph Govt
2. 1st roll out of 5G is from Langkawi where Tun Dr M is the MP. From there it will spread to all of Malaysia.
3. About 90% or Rm50.3 billions of the 2020 budget(Rm56 billions) available for spending go into Nfcp.
4. All the days and months ahead will see more and more news revolving around fiberisation theme
5. Tun said Malaysia transited from agro based economy to industrial one. Now from industry to digitalisation
All the people will be aware only later. The few who see early and invested early will make the most
6. Surprisingly, all the Investment banks, edgedaily, focus, star, busy weekly, did NOT chose Nfcp stocks in their top 10 picks for year 2020
7. More surprise is the total neglect of Nfcp stocks in i3 stock year 2020 contest stock-picks, too.
8. SUCH A Big Undertaking with RM50.3 BILLIONS CASH INFUSION THAT WILL TRIGGER A MULTI YEAR BULL RUN IN NFCP STOCKS - YET CAN BE OVERLOOKED BY EXPERTS AND MASSES IS QUITE UNBELIEVABLE INDEED
9. BUT ACTUALLY GOOD FOR ALL OF US BECAUSE WE GET IN AT THE LOWEST PRICES
10. BUT THE MOST AMAZING THING IS THIS.
SO MANY HAVE READ AND REREAD OUR POSITIVE HIGHLIGHTS IN NETX & OTHER FORUM ABOUT THE FANTASTIC PROSPECTS OF NFCP YET CANNOT SEE ANYTHING GOOD AT ALL (LIKE 3III , JJOHNCHEW, SHOOTUP AND OTHERS) HAVE BEEN SO BLIND TO MISS THIS ONCE IN A LIFETIME BULL RUN FOR NFCP DIGITAL STOCKS FOR UPSTREAM NETWORK FIBER CONNECTIVITY
NEVER MIND. IF THEY MISSED WE MUST INVEST EVEN MORE. AND REAP GREATER GAINS AS WELL. THE POOR WILL REMAIN POOR BUT THE RICH WILL GET RICHER

If you don't engage Netx then will you employ foreign workers from China, India, bangla or Nepal?
Since Nfcp extends to every nook and corner of Malaysia to the remotest parts can these foreigners speak Malay?
Of course not. Even China workers can only do lumpu jobs in Specific industrial clusters. Bangla with low skill can only do low skilled jobs
So Nfcp jobs will go to experienced company with high skilled workforce

Like an incoming wave stock prices move forward 3 feet then retrace backward 2 feet
The wave movements do not go in a straight line. So is stock prices.
During the Ogse bull run of Carimin, velesto, penergy, Uzma and Dayang prices moved up strongly and the retraced many times
But it moved higher and higher as Ogse job awards progressed
So these same patterns will be repeated in Nfcp bull run
The power behind how far and how high each individual stocks can go depend on
1. The quantum of job awards
2. The profit margin it can show up in its balance sheet
3. Any special incentive to shareholders management might dish out. In Carimin and Penergy are dividends while Dayang gave rights issue at attractive price
So these can be expected in Nfcp stocks in coming months and years as they garnered new found wealth...overflowing wealth from Nfcp jobs like never before
Traders who are nimble and Chun will do well.
Greed and fear will always be in play
But since we have a very very favourable wind we should unfurl our sail and catch the bull run for as long as it lasts
Regards
Calvin

If you feel the need to write something pls do, but don't post it lah. Gullible ppl like me picked up your comment and bought a lemom.

KUALA LUMPUR: The second extension of the movement control order to contain the Covid-19 outbreak — now totalling six weeks until April 28 — means that economic activities will remain subdued for at least another 14 days.
The pandemic, which has infected nearly two million and killed over 100,000 worldwide, presents the worst start possible for the recession expected ahead. As the infection curve has yet to near its peak, it is anyone’s guess on the depth of the economic downturn.
Against this backdrop, survival is the prominent concern now. Investors’ attention is drawn to companies’ balance sheets instead of growth prospects, which is widely expected to be minimal in the best-case scenario, as business volume dwindles and operating cash flow shrink.
Asia Analytica data shows that of some 880 listed companies (after excluding the 40 banks, insurers and investment trusts), 597 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia have cash that is less than their short-term liabilities.
Companies in many different sectors are underlined here, from furniture companies to retailers, automotive-related firms, and a wide range of manufacturers and trading companies.
Meanwhile, 223 listed companies have an interest cover ratio of below one times, meaning their earnings before interests and tax cannot cover interest expenses for a full year. The market capitalisation of most of these companies are below RM2 billion.
Some 321 companies were already in the red last year. Of the 599 profitable ones, around 45.6% of them saw profit decline in the period. Again, most on the list are small-cap firms, according to Asia Analytica data.
It is also worth noting that the economic downturn would be a tough test on companies’ sales quality. Companies with a high portion of credit sale with mounting receivables could be at risk amid the potential cash trap.
A random check shows that 75 listed companies or 8.2% have net gearing of over 100%. Sectors with the most companies in this category are logistics, construction, oil and gas, building materials and property development.
Others with net gearing of above 80% include power companies, telecommunications companies and building materials companies. Power producers’ liabilities are usually backed up by the steady cash flow from power purchase agreements.
On the flip side, notable sectors with low net gearing average include Internet and gas utility companies, and technology solution providers.
Of 79 generic companies with market capitalisation of above RM2 billion (ex-banks, real-estate investment trusts and insurers) only 22 have a cash ratio of above one times and net gearing of below 50%, led by Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd, Petronas Gas Bhd and IOI Corp Bhd.
As reflected by the price-to-book valuations, preference is given for companies with high cash, low debt, steady recurring income and high-quality clients, such as tech companies, and broadband providers.
There are also lesser-known small-cap companies that are cash-rich with sturdy past operations.
As a fund manager pointed out that a downturn is a brewing pot for merger and acquisition activities, as smaller, cash-rich companies with good assets or business prospects usually become undervalued after the market selldown.
The first quarter’s (1Q20) financial result will show how much cash was exhausted amid the two-week shutdown in the second half of March, while prospects of the entire half of 2Q20 being under movement restriction are still visible."

Ansell, a subsidiary within the Ansell Group, forms part of a global conglomerate involved in the manufacturing of surgical and examination gloves, healthcare safety devices and active infection prevention products for healthcare professionals and patients, and single-use industrial application gloves. The Ansell Group’s manufacturing facilities are located globally, and distributes its products to over 55 countries. In Malaysia, the Ansell Group operates 2 manufacturing and distribution facilities in Kedah and Malacca, and, through the Proposed Joint Venture, plans to increase its presence and market share in Malaysia. Careplus and Ansell had mutually decided to utilise CMSB as the vehicle for the Proposed Joint Venture in view of CMSB’s already established business and customer base, as well as the suitability of CMSB’s production capabilities in producing and manufacturing gloves to Ansell’s requirements and specification. Through the Shareholders’ Agreement which would determine the management structure and the shared 50:50 ownership of CMSB, Careplus would be able to leverage on Ansell Group’s market experience, knowledge and business alliances in the glove manufacturing industry. Ansell Group’s existing global footprint offers new market opportunities for CMSB’s upstream segment to grow its business. Further, the partnership with Ansell Group complements Careplus Group’s continued strategy to grow its global portfolio and increase market reach where Ansell Group operates. In addition, the Proposed Joint Venture will allow Careplus to unlock the value of its investment in CMSB and recognise a net gain on disposal of RM17.98 million. The Group would also receive indicative total cash proceeds of approximately RM26.97 million, which will be mainly used for the CMSB Subscription, capital expenditure and working capital purposes, in the manner set out in Section 4 of this Circular"

New Catalysts for higher upside of share price
• Completion of disposal of 50% equity interest in Careplus (M) S/B (CMSB), a wholly owned subsidiary to Ansell for RM 27.0 mil.
• Sale at 150% of the 50% Net Asset value of CMSB and realized a profit on disposal of about RM17.98mil which is about 3.07 Sen EPS in Q2 FY 2020.
• Net proceeds of cash RM28.5 mil coming to Careplus after netting of additional share capital of RM10.5 mil for reinvestment in CMSB for subscription of new shares for expansion in CAPEX and repayment by CMSB of inter co loan of 12 mil
• This capital expenditure includes the upgrading and modification of CMSB’s existing machinery and premises, such as the purchase of a set of automated surgical glove packing machines and the renovation of CMSB’s existing packing room to cater for the new products to be supplied to and sold to Ansell and its affiliates
• On completion will create a Joint Venture which represent a strategic partnership between Careplus and Ansell to grow and develop CMSB’s glove manufacturing business, premised on creating sustainable long-term growth, expanding portfolios and future business activities while realising synergies in the value of CMSB.
• to grow CMSB’s business, leveraging on the knowledge and cooperation of Ansell Group, one of the global players for glove manufacturing in the market.
• Turning CMSB around from loss making to profitable with new business
The current increase in top and bottom line coupled with above profit on disposal and the 50:50 joint venture arrangement with Ansell for surgical glove using Ansell technology which would be profitable."

temporary setback due to COVID-19 situation and the MCO, we are cautiously optimistic of
better performance in the coming quarters, especially with all our traditional core businesses
back in full swing to catch up with pending orders and works that were halted in 2Q2020.
Meanwhile, we have also taken prudent steps to enhance our cost control initiatives including
managing and rationalizing capital expenditures. Furthermore, we believe that the incoming
mega infrastructure projects in Sarawak will bode well for our traditional core businesses
especially the Cement, Construction Materials & Trading and Construction & Road
Maintenance Divisions. We will continue to leverage on our local knowledge and experienced

Funds love to buy stocks with a theme when a disguising scenario presents itself, ie. msci
Do you think funds could have bought without moving the price on a regular day? And more importantly why do you think they willingly absorb it if it's a lousy share with no good story to run on for the next year riding on stocks with economic recovery theme.
So why do funds buy YTL in the first place? Two words, HSR and cement.
Do you know that YTL has 70% monopoly on cement after buying out their competition? And cement prices have been running up since 2019. As you well know construction work can take years, there will be a long runaway for YTL to profit from selling cement alone - 1 bil profit just from cement, understand that.
Last it had 1 bil profit, it was trading north of 1.5. And that's just from cement, how about the construction contracts?
You should also know that as they were previously handling the HSR projects, they have on their hands very useful logistics data to cut HUGE costs on the HSR project. Do you think the gov would want to waste unnecessarily on this project? Certainly not.
Moving on, with the new tendering, there has been realignment of the tracks, and as you well know YTL is part owner of ERL which connects to KLIA, and HSR will be integrated with KLIA. So can you imagine YTL not benefiting?
The economy moving on will be very bullish on construction companies due to dire need to stimulate and jump-start the economy. The best proxy to construction theme is YTL.
tdlr: Just buy YTL for a easy two bagger in one year.

CAHYA Mata Sarawak Bhd’s (CMS) earnings forecast for the financial year 2021 (FY21) and FY22 has been revised upwards on expectations of higher income from its associates OM Materials (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd and Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd.
RHB Investment Bank Bhd (RHB Research) raised the conglomerate’s earnings forecast for the next two years by 9% and maintained a ‘Buy’ call on CMS with a higher target price (TP) of RM2.90 from RM2.40.
“Earnings prospects for CMS’ associates OM Materials and Kenanga Investment are turning more upbeat on the ferroalloy selling price rebounds and buoyant equity trading turnover year-to-date.
“This prompts us to raise our FY21-FY22 forecast earnings by 9% to between RM217 million and RM233 million, suggesting an upside risk to the current FY21 consensus forecast of RM170 million,” its analyst Lester Siew said in a note yesterday."

However, analysts have mixed views on the investigation of possible financial management involving its chief financial officer Syed Hizam Alsagoff, which CMS has clarified is a separate matter altogether.
Shares of CMS opened higher and rose as much as 10 sen from its five-month low of RM1.70, before paring some gains to still trade up 6 sen or 3.53% to RM1.76.
The counter fell 33 sen 16.26% on Thursday after CMS announced Syed Hizam was suspended for one month as investigations take place.
Maybank IB Research in its research note today lowered its target price to RM1.75 from RM2.50, after it tagged a “governance risk factor” on its valuation multiple.
“At yesterday’s briefing, CMS’ group managing director clarified that matters relating to its deputy group chairman and group CFO are unrelated,” it said.
In the note, Maybank IB said the issue stemmed from losses at PPES Works Sdn Bhd, a 49% unit of CMS which owns 70% in a joint venture with Bina Puri Sdn Bhd for the RM1.36 billion Pan Borneo Highway Phase 1 WPC06 contract.
“What triggered the case-in-point was Pan Borneo’s contract/construction losses at PPES Works Sdn Bhd,” it said. At the 70:30 JV level, the project is still profitable,” it said.
CMS, it said, is drawing the Terms of Reference (ToR) to appoint a consultant by mid-May 2021.
“As the ToR would also include a review of the group’s control system and risk mitigation measures to ensure no future recurrences, we think that the consultant’s work could take a while.
“Meanwhile, a potential share buy- back exercise may cap its share price near-term downside,” the research house said.
Separately, TA Research has kept its target price of RM2.40 on the counter, maintaining the bullish view shared by analysts over the counter prior to the incident.
“Based on management’s guidance, the total loss incurred was about RM54 million, which had already been recognized in the previous financial years.
“We are of the view that if the allegations are proven to be true, it would certainly affect the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) rating. Nevertheless, we believe that business operations will remain intact as the investigation will not affect the daily operations,” it said.
“We reckon that the group is likely to achieve stronger earnings in the upcoming quarters, underpinned by healthy demand for building materials from the local infrastructure projects as well as the strong recurring income from [telco infrastructure unit] Sacofa.
“Meanwhile, we expect OM Materials (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd will return to the black, thanks to the strong recovery of average selling prices for ferrosilicon and manganese,” said TA Research."

Need more & more cautious & alert when putting the bet...
Especially for those IB start to revise lower target price...
Furthermore need to reconsider is it the right time to be hero & warrior to challenge the current situation...
Don't forget all asset managements need to compliance to each investment policies to protect unit holders...
Once any ""whistleblower"" on any scandal...asset management need to pre-cautious action to minimize the risk...

In a statement today, the SC also said that auditors are required by law to report to the SC if it finds any material issues, or if there are any potential breach of securities laws and rules of the stock exchange.
The SC is likely referring to the decision by Serba Dinamik’s external auditor KPMG to go to SC with its audit red flags in the company’s books for the 12-month period ended Dec 31, 2020, which was announced in May. Following that, the SC announced in the first week of June that it had started investigations into the matter, following the dispute between the company and KPMG over the handling of the audit issues, and that it had secured documents and records from Serba Dinamik to assist its investigations."

Look at the glove counters especially TopGlove and see how sometimes EPF buy even at higher prices, and later you can see disposal at lower price later. They may have entered at various stage during uptrend or downtrend of any stock and the reason for selling/buying is only known to them (i.e end Q2 adjustment, I-sinar etc etc, you name it).
In the case of CMSB, it is not entirely surprising to see EPF come back and wallop CMSB shares at a later date even at higher prices. Why? Reason only known to them. As long as the company is stable and have good growth prospect, that is more important to me.
CMSB is definitely well sought after recovery theme play stock. Just need to be patient."

Cahya Mata Sarawak Bhd said Datuk Sri Sulaiman Abdul Rahman Taib has taken the role of managing director in the company.
Following Sulaiman's return to the helm, former boss Datuk Isaac Lugun has been redesignated as non-independent and non-executive director effective July 8. ""We are pleased to welcome Sulaiman to lead the Group,"" said group chairman Tan Sri Abdul Rashid Manaf said in a statement today.
""Sulaiman’s familiarity with Cahya Mata Sarawak and his wide-ranging experience in businesses will be invaluable to Group as we consolidate, streamline, and move the Group toward a new growth path, post pandemic,"" he added.
Abdul Rashid said this transition was due to the early retirement of Isaac, who, will continue to be with the group in his new capacity as a board member.
Sulaiman, 53, has previously served Cahya Mata Sarawak in various capacities there from 1995 to 2008.
During his 13-year tenure, he assumed various positions including that of Group Chairman, and Group Executive Director.
Sulaiman was re-appointed to the board on June 22."

One of the most important elements in ancient war is grains (fund/political funds). There is Chinese proverbs say "" San Jun Wei Dong, Liang Cao Xian Xin"" which translate one need to move your grains ahead before you mobilise your 3 battalions to war.
Why funding that important?? From pamphlets, banners, flags, posters, CSR, community dinner during campaign talk, RENT-a-crowd, cyber walfares and etc need money. The chances of victory is moving proportionate with the size of funding.
Where to find fundings?? Jibby famous tagline ""donation"". Law limit 200k donation max per individual or group 4 MP constitution.
If I were a Foochow Boss, the eassier way to contribute is to goreng when the receipant have interest in a listed entities. Ask any Sarawakian who are there Foochow boss. This is absolutely legal.
Goodies(gula-2) : what r the wishlists of people of Sarawak?
ANSWER : 1)lnfrastruture and 2)development
1) City folk like u, cannot imagine rural voters will vote just for a simple tar road, community hospital or school, lnternet access, proper paip water or electricity.
2) its norms for current ruling party to announce projects(development) be4 election. What is BABY(cahaya mata) core business?? Project win share goes up, crony too get thier shares.

3) some retailers and some big sharks try fighting back. Whales will sell when price try reversal prompting price to deep further. More shareholders (those at penthouse) starts to cut lost after support after supports fail to hold. CMSB delay finding and no +ve news on current issue. RM1. 8 - RM1. 4
4) Whales dump the balance holding akin the final nail to the coffin. RM1.4 - RM1. 2. meagre gain/break even/small lost.
5)retailers lost hope kept selling. Bad market days due to MCO RM1. 2 - RM1. 05
6) Big funds mostly insiders start to accumulate big. Whales of same allegiance collect too and will block/hand brake until collection is done.

RSI bullish divergence is spotted in this stock as RSI creates multiple higher highs and higher lows. This could imply that the bulls might be ready to take control soon and it often marks the end of a downtrend.
S1 (RM1.08) is the resilient support. Investors or traders must be cautious if the price drops below S1. PPT1 (RM1.26), PPT2 (RM1.48) and PPT 3 (RM1.77) are the price targets if a position is open at the closing price. These indicate the potential gains of CMSB are 16.62%, 37.50% and 64.34% respectively."

Conspiracy Theory :
1) Big whales starts dumping ""baby"" at peak Rm2. 52, where most tickets is acquired at low during bekir margin call time. Rate of dumping, slow with very big gain.
2) purposely leak out internal wrong doing CBT by CFO, market panic, rate dump intensify by whales(still gain) coupled by fund selling EPF & Tabung haji. Retailers join in to savage what ever paper gain. RM2. 2 to to RM1. 8
3) some retailers and some big sharks try fighting back. Whales will sell when price try reversal prompting price to deep further. More shareholders (those at penthouse) starts to cut lost after support after supports fail to hold. CMSB delay finding and no +ve news on current issue. RM1. 8 - RM1. 4
4) Whales dump the balance holding akin the final nail to the coffin. RM1.4 - RM1. 2. meagre gain/break even/small lost.
5)retailers lost hope kept selling. Bad market days due to MCO RM1. 2 - RM1. 05
6) Big funds mostly insiders start to accumulate big. Whales of same allegiance collect too and will block/hand brake until collection is done.
RM1. 05 - RM1. 30
7) release news 3rd party audit by KPMG is of min damage. IN ACTUAL CASE COM. FINANCIAL RESULT ARE INTACT, no evidence of tempering. KPMG report the facts only!!!
8) whales release handbrake, a gentle push and market react positively/cheering to the announcement by buying back aggressively knowing BABY is a gems.
9) State government announce dissolve of State Assembly after audience with Governnor(Peh MOH) and pending election date from EC.
10) CMSB surge higher day by day, good news after good news."

EPF sell because dividend yield getting lesser this 2 years. I believe even through trimming down it will still hold a sizable shares >5% in cahaya. Current challenging time, BOD reduce dividend, normal ma.
Additional reasons :
1) some i3 member suggest to prepare fund 4 i-sinar with drawers. I agree too!
2) Big funds need to adhere to protocols, due diligences and compliances, unlike us.
- they position long time ago, with substantial holding of multiple entry price, easy for them to rebalance their portfolios.
- EPF too outsourced their fund to 3rd party
I understand the feeling of holding a counter which have funds exiting every now and then.
*** important is the market able to support the dumping. U buy there must be match seller and vice versa.
Since 2 months back, these 2 taiko sell but price cont surging. So dun too worried no doubt it will slow down the momentum when price rising."

Many will argue they are in different industries but one cannot deny the facts is these 2 companies wealth generating ability are in PAR.
Unisem too once's encounter share price hammered to around rm2. Same apply to cmsb.
Once bitten twice shy :
9th September, cmsb price adjusted lower due to profits taking. Every sane mind people who wanted to sell wouldn't sell at 1.03 for the 2nd time. Pandai pandai hop back to ride to destination 2.0.
I loved playing poker but how about playing blackjack today?
The Dealer (KPMG) is giving u an open Ace's (Q2 47.39m) and the 2nd closed card ( 3rd party audit reveiwing) pending this month end.
- if big account fraud or problem occurs , KPMG for sure prepare/advice for a impairment before hand in Q2.
- Previous CFO will not so easy let go just by giving him sotong. MACC will ask for interview long time ago.
For fence sitters, the 2nd card will be min. damaged. Good to be alerted earlier and the risk committee board to revert so that future reoccurring be avoided.

The Employees Provident Fund
(EPF) has ceased to be a substantial
shareholder of Cahya
Mata
Sarawak
Bhd (CMSB),
its Bursa
Malaysia
filing
showed
today.
The provident fund’s stake in
the group dropped below 5% after
it disposed of a total of 1.8 million
shares on Sept 10.
Previously on Aug 26, the
EPF disposed of 798,600 shares
in CMSB, reducing its stake to
5.12% or 54.98 million shares in
the group.
Based on back-of-the-envelope
calculations, the latest transaction
on Sept 10 leaves EPF with 53.18
million shares in CMSB.
The group recently in June
this year reshuffled the members
of its audit committee, as well as
its nomination and remuneration
committee.
This came amid allegations
of conflict of interest in terms of
awarding contracts and possible
financial mismanagement among
its top executives.
The group also said previous-
ly that its independent consultant
KPMG Management & Risk Consulting
Sdn
Bhd
(KPMG
MRC)
—
which was
appointed in June to
review
the group’s
financial management
of certain
investments
and
contracts — has completed
its
reports.
However, the legal investigations
of the investments
and
contracts
are still ongoing,
it added.
Shares in CMSB finished one
sen or 0.75% lower to RM1.32,
giving it a market value of RM1.42
billion. It saw 3.45 million shares
traded today.
Year to date, the stock has fallen
by 38.6% from RM2.15 recorded
in early January this year."

Sacofa today remains Sarawak’s leading ICT
infrastructure company and the key driver behind
the development of the State’s state-of-the-art
telecommunications and information technologies
infrastructure. The Company has been accorded
the right to build, manage, lease and maintain
telecommunication towers in Sarawak. It has also
been granted “deemed native status” allowing it to
acquire native lands in the State for the construction
of telecommunication facilities.
PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
In FY 2020, Sacofa turned in a strong performance
positing revenue totalling RM254.65 million (FY
2019: RM242.31 million) and PBT amounting to
RM114.31 million (FY 2019: RM112.60 million).
As the major telecommunications infrastructure
provider in Sarawak responsible for over 90% of
mobile traffic in the State, Sacofa was deemed an
essential services provider and was able to continue
running its operations unhampered throughout the
initial MCO period.
OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
Sacofa played a key role during the pandemic to
ensure Sarawak’s telecommunication infrastructure
operated flawlessly. Internally, Sacofa was able to
adapt quickly to the new normal and stringent SOPs
by bringing its Business Continuity Planning policies
into play within hours of the announcement of the
first MCO. This was done with minimal disruption to
its business and operations.
Externally, Sacofa was able to coordinate with
its various partners and customers to ensure its
network remained uninterrupted by the demands
and needs during the pandemic. As a result of its
robust network design and planning, Sacofa faced
no major incidents or outages especially when
the network was most needed. The Company also
ensured it paid particular attention to essential
critical service locations such as hospitals,
emergency services and government installations to
ensure the network continued without interruption.
Given the network’s built-in capacity, retail service
providers or RSPs were able to upgrade their
networks based on user demands as and when
required.
In FY 2020, Sacofa continued to grow its asset
portfolio by constructing 84 towers across
Sarawak in support of its major customers,
as well as in line with State and Federal
Government initiatives. To date, Sacofa owns
and manages over 1,800 towers throughout
Sarawak with more than 11,000 km of fibre optic cable. Over 55% of the towers Sacofa owned have been fiberised and made 5G-ready."

Up to the reporting date, the Group has incurred RM7,244,541 in the implementation of the ERP system. However, the Group views that the vendor was in breach of the contract by failing to provide all the services and/or fulfill its obligations in relation to providing an ERP solution and system implementation. Consequently, a decision was made to stop proceeding with the implementation. As a result, the Group has written off the cost incurred for the implementation together with all direct expenses amounting to RM7,810,442 during the financial year ended 31 December 2020. Subsequently, on 27 January 2021, the Group received a letter of demand from the vendor for USD1,073,325 (approximately RM4.3 million) to be payable for various alleged work performed. These claims have not been provided for in the financial statements as Management views that these claims were not issued in accordance with the contract.

Problems solving 1 by 1 :
1) . The Accounts of Malaysia Phosphate Additives Sarawak (MPAS) was not audited by EY or CMSB external auditor.

2) Written off PPE of MPAS complex complex 2 and no ending delay in the commencement of operation of phosphate complex 1.
*** complex 1 already starts operation and bearing fruits to cms group. Additional income.

Article : In 2021, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimated that economically extractable phosphate rock reserves worldwide are 71 billion tons, while world mining production in 2020 was 223 million tons. Assuming zero growth, the reserves would thus last for 260 years.
Since there is limit to this commodities, it's a lucrative venture and price will rise with time. Phosphate mainly use in production of fertiliser ( baja hitam, wakaka my favourite) and phosphoric acid, which is used in everything from food and cosmetics to animal feed and electronics.can smell $$$$?
3) write off RM7,244,541 in the implementation of the ERP system.
*** that's why I say previous CFO got element of fraud. He is Concluding with the vendor (taking kickback) to deliver a below par system. Out of the inflated figure, I believe there are module's that can be salvage back ex hardwares and common modules in the software part. Solution, find a reputable vendor to put it online ASAP. For the balance amount, dispute this in court plus compensation as CMSB got strong case here.

Smelting
This business segment covers the operations of the FeSi and manganese alloy smelter operated by OM Sarawak and the Qinzhou manganese alloy smelter operated by OM Materials (Qinzhou) Co Ltd (“OMQ”).
The operations within OM Sarawak and OMQ recorded revenue of A$255.3 million for 1H 2021 as compared to A$272.1 million for 1H 2020. The decrease in revenue was mainly due to the
lower volumes of ferroalloys produced and sold in 1H 2021 as compared to 1H 2020.
OM Sarawak produced a total of 61,472 tonnes and 94,827 tonnes of FeSi and manganese alloy respectively in 1H 2021 (1H 2020: 96,508 tonnes of FeSi and 109,415 tonnes of manganese
alloy) and sold 55,360 tonnes and 101,944 tonnes of FeSi and manganese alloy respectively (1H 2020: 80,538 tonnes of FeSi and 99,833 tonnes of manganese alloy).
Total revenue contribution
for 1H 2021 was A$232.8 million as compared to A$256.1 million for 1H 2020. 4 FeSi furnaces have were shut-down since the second quarter of 2020 due to limited manpower at the Plant because of labour disruptions coupled with lockdowns and strict travel restrictions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, operations at the Plant were also temporarily suspendedfor about 1 month as a result of positive COVID-19 cases which also contributed to the decrease in production tonnages and sales volume in 1H 2021.
OMQ’s production was suspended after the shut-down of its 2 furnaces at the end of March 2020 for scheduled maintenance and furnace upgrading. A furnace transformer was subsequently upgraded from 16.5MVA to 25.5MVA to improve production efficiency and to provide the Qinzhou
smelter with added flexibility to produce either SiMn or HCFeMn. Full commercial operations for the upgraded furnace commenced in late January 2021 and the second furnace was subsequently restarted in March 2021. OMQ produced 24,684 tonnes of manganese alloy and 14,469 tonnes of manganese sinter ore in 1H 2021 (1H 2020: 10,140 tonnes of manganese alloy and 8,051 tonnes of manganese sinter ore) and had a revenue contribution of A$22.5 million for 1H 2021 as compared to A$16.0 million for 1H 2020.
The smelting segment recorded a higher contribution of A$40.5 million for 1H 2021 as compared to A$22.3 million for 1H 2020 predominantly due to the improved prices for ferroalloys, particularly
FeSi, which resulted in improved margins achieved, and the one-off gain from the de-recognition of financial liabilities realised from the redenomination of the MYR portion of the project finance
loan to USD. This increase was also contributed by OMQ having resumed full operations in the
first quarter of FY2021."

Why suddenly government so good, it's KELUARGA MALAYSIA slowly transforming? Why is there such an ungency to fork up 1B just to increase another 10% connectivity from existing 80 to 90%. This coverage/penetration issue suppose to fall under work scope of telcos. In other words, telcos pays as written in concessionaire agreement.
It cost RM1, 666,666.67 per BTS (base transceiver station). OMG!!

from many analysts’ reports. Despite being a strong growth company,
Transmile had not really been able to turn its sales into cash. Transmile’s
trade receivables had been building over the years with trade receivables
for 2006 were reported at RM381.2 million, which was a 243% jump or
RM270.1 million more than the previous year, while growth in 2005 was
5% and 2004, 46.1%. With revenue recorded increase of 80% or RM439.1
million during the same year 2006, receivables accounted for much more
of the company’s revenue growth. Since trade receivables could have
influence on the profitability reported, it would be prudent for analyst to
be on the alert as these trade receivables could easily be re-classified as
doubtful debts.
The cash flows from the operation activities substantially dropped
from RM161.2 million in 2005 to RM18 million in 2006, which resulted
in the company not having sufficient fund from its operating activities
to service the interest payments of existing debt which stood at RM36.5
million. The shortfall had been financed by its cash flow from financing
activities. Given the substantial drop in the operating cash flow and the
level of debts, question lingered over the sufficiency of the future cash flow"

The drop also gave rise to concerns on its ability to finance its futuregrowth as seeking funds maybe more expensive in the future. Transmile’s cash and bank balances as at year-end 2006 stood at RM417 million. Of this amount, only a meager RM18 million came from its operating activitieswhile much of it, RM260.7 million was from the previous year and RM287 million from the issuance of new shares."

Its share price had risen by 428.3% since2003 and analysts had always maintained bullish views on Transmile.Key points that were usually highlighted by analysts were, Transmile’s strong growth in earnings; its five year pact with DHL, as its strategic partner; its landing rights in various cities around Asia, freedom rightsout of Hong Kong and China to the US; its increasing capacity includingthe four long haul and fuel efficient MD11 planes freighters; and thecompany’s strong and reputable shareholders such as The Kuok Groupand Pos Malaysia. In order to encourage a better understanding of the company’s performance and latest developments, Transmile had also conducted several briefing sessions to interested fund managers and analysts and “one to one” dialogue sessions upon request.

One of the leading local research houses was rating Transmile’s share as a “strong buy” with an expected total return exceeding 20% in the next 12 months, underpinnedby the reported net profit growth of 110.5%. An analyst explained thatthis was mainly due to the increase in aircraft capacity in 2006,contributed by the arrival of four MD-11s in September 2005. Curiously enough, the research house’s own estimate on the Transmile’s profitwasn’t that far off, but merely by 1.5% than that of Transmile’s own inflated figure. Other analysts were not bad either in their estimates, with Transmile’s figures were just 4.6% above consensus.

Here's the summary of his concerns raised by Anson:
1. CMSB's CFO has resigned from his employment.
Answer: CFO was fired through non renewal of the employment contract
2. Group MD has resigned from his employment.
Answer : Group MD was seen forced from early retirement through the transitional plan
3. Lembaga Tabung Haji (LTH) dumping the shares.
Answer : LTH remains the substantial shareholder held 7.57% after trimming its stakes.
4.EPF ceased to be substantial shareholder
Answer : It's hard to gauge EPF direction. They even ceased to be the substantial shareholder of TAAn in Aug 21.
5. CMSB's case sharing the similar commonity with Serbadk.
Answer : CMSB has delayed disclosure of the KPMG findings until end of October as legal investigations is underway. This, is what really different from Serbadk."

Answer : Transmile scandal is not as complexed as it seen. Inflated Receivable and rapid depleting cash in Bank in a short period are the good warning signals. As far as i know, Transmile had been enjoying robust revenues growth in 3 years and Receivable inflated to 381 millions for 2006 or surged 270m in comparison to the previous year. In addition, cash flows from operation activities substantially dropped from 161 million to 18 million in 2006.
CMSB doesn't face any inflated Receivable or depletion of cash flows. CMSB net cash used in operating activities is merely 1.5 million in 6 months results to 30 Jun 21.
Investment securities 409 million
Cash and bank Balance 375 million
Non Current Loan 325 million

Answer : CMSB said that independent review has been completed by KPMG and legal investigations of the said investments and contracts are still ongoing.As far as i know, legal investigations is such a gathering together of facts in a situation which will be tried in the court. CMSB may take legal action against the previous management for mishandling the company affairs and possible of white-collar crime action.
I can't think of other ugly areas in the accounts which will be affected the company substantial future cash out flows to the company. The accounts looks good except 60% ownership of the Phosphate division investment which is not audited by EY. CMSB does not enter into any commodity contract posting the unaccountable risks.

This Anson, give comparison also so lousy, sigh!!
Transmile : this company business plan was destined to close shop for it reluctant/unable to evolve with time. It came to existence in 90's because there are growing urgency for air transportation of niche products across the supply chains across globe. Malaysia experience a boom in manufacturing, particularly in E&E and semiconductor industries. Though still at infancy, as more FDI pouring in, demand for air transportation increasing at exponential rate.
Time change,
1) industry revolution and marketing strategy had force Mutinational companies instead of dedicated of specific components or parts (spread manufacturing), consolidate everything into 1 roof according to regions. They encourage the development of support industries at nearby satellite towns that's slowly depleting amount of goods handle by transmile.
I skip why the do this.
2) great expansion of maritime asset ( shipping linears and deep water ports) plus land connectivity. With much bigger class contena, safer and frequency increase, supply chain cannot feel the disruption in their process cos needed parts can replenish in time (semi or fully finish products) compare to 10 days or more in conventional sea transport. That reduce a lot on meaning of urgency.
3) put everything in 1 basket. Only 1 core business where else aerospace spare parts and aeroplane repairing contribution is small. At its peak Transmile owned 15 aircrafts, 9 Boeing 737 with balance propellers. How to compete with DHL, FEDEX or UPS in terms of network?
While running on depleted cash flow, the only options is bank borrowing. It very common in the 80's/90's where business community take loop hole in bankruptcy act's to con banks. GAN just do it 1 step ahead by listing it in Klse and got Kwok along they way. Is it act of desperation or preplanned on 1st day, only he got the answer.
When Transmile pronounced died on March 2011, Airasia is at it's prime time. Do u think TF will miss the chance as to fill the vacumm left behind if its so lucrative business? Airasia got cargo but not intended to challenge international market leaders.
Even in e-commerce era or gig economy, well established freight companies also dun dare big head going into air operators. They buy air slots to connect B2B or B2C, max 1 or 2 aircrafts that's suite operation requirements."

during the financial year.
2. CMSB booked heavy losses in Associate, OM Materials, for year 2020 is due to one off subscription of ICPS.

In 2018, pursuant to the Share Subscription Agreement with OM Materials (Sarawak) Sdn. Bhd. (“OM Sarawak”), OM Materials
(S) Pte. Ltd. (“OM Singapore”) exercised its option to call upon the non-controlling interest shareholder of OM Sarawak to sell

Management Sdn. Bhd.'s impairment on property, plant & equipment and Samalaju Properties

4.
Software implementation cost written off The Group entered into a contract for the procurement and implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system with a vendor on 24 July 2019 for an amount of USD3.0 million (approximately RM12.4 million). Up to the reporting date, the Group has incurred RM7,244,541 in the implementation of the ERP system. However, the Group views that the vendor was in breach of the contract by failing to provide all the services and/or fulfill its obligations in relation to providing an ERP solution and system implementation. Consequently, a decision was made to stop proceeding with the implementation. As a result, the Group has written off the cost incurred for the implementation together with all direct expenses amounting to RM7,810,442 during the financial year ended 31 December 2020. Subsequently, on 27 January 2021, the Group received a letter of demand from the vendor for USD1,073,325 (approximately RM4.3 million) to be payable for various alleged work performed. These claims have not been provided for in the financial statements as Management views that these claims were not issued in accordance with the contract. Management, in consultation with their solicitors, is of the opinion that such demands are frivolous and the Group intends to contest such claims vigorously.

U got Anson wronged, by saying he's a retiree.
Who Anson is?
A young ciku, any one try before? A guy in his early thirty, who spent most of his free time besides working into online games. Used GG Garena clients platform to play his favourite DOTA2 ( Defence Of The Ancients 2) either at home or cybercafé. Very familiar with characters such as SD (shadow demon), AM (anti mage), PA(phantom assassin) etc on their skills and ultimate power is. Guy with very small social circles, no romance and lonely who had big dreams but reluctant to work harder (find accurate facts, details, analysis) cos too indulged into games.
See how often he use GG in his comments. The word GG in e-game culture means :
Polite way : good game
Rude way : ur team lose, game over or finish, u guys sucks.
It's totally hearsay to say SD is a sarawak base company, where Karim started his career as mechanical engineer in Asean Bintulu Fertillizer s/b (1988) before setting up Serba Dinamik. SD HQ is in Seksyen 14, Shah Alam, Selangor.
By his logic, can we assume GRAB is Malaysia 1st unicorn startup since both founders Anthony Tan and Tan Hooi Ling are both born Majaysian with early office in Klang valley before become Singaporean?
In few days time, one will see great disparity in price movement for CMSB and SD, once SIR and KPMG report out.
1) cahaya price cont recovery, main point is damaged in CFO inflicted damage was minimum damage plus +ve catalysts budget 2022, sarawak's state election, recovery theme, big tender participation and asp increase.
I maintain, the ONLY villian is outgoing CFO.
2) SD, persistent downward movement cos lucky anticipate EY results mostly identical with KPMG.
TA for CMSB, price will be well supported at 1.39 and drastically up when report concluded.
Worst senario - 1.33 to 1.36, which I am glad to support with my extra funds.
*** all with profits or lesser lost are welcome to sell. Now 10m daily transactions waiting 4 u if one could not bear the risk/ reduce risk of the outcome RESULT. Negative sentiment diminish as date nearer to announcement.
LUCKYBOY TELL ONLY THE TRUTH!!!"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000495.jsp?ftp=146","Oct 25, 2021 2:52 AM","Luckyboy88","I never step one more leg/bad mouth or show off in SD i3 forum for once's. If not because of needs to differentiate bet 2, I would not comment as it's non of my business.
SD holders : prepare for worst scenario
1) EY more the same as KPMG, another lv down from 52w low.
2) tough road ahead, very hard to find supports from creditors ( suppliers, bankers, bond holders)
*** Trust deficit, cost for projects financing goes higher and eat into net margin in order to be competitived thus reduce cash flow. It nature business model requires big capital row over before projects completed subject to 90/120 days term. Genuine receivable.
In contrast with CMSB, manufacturing plants ( cement, MPAS, Ferrosilicon) ALL PPE, are prebuild or invested and only need small capex to generate revenues. Sacofa rely on rental income, where else Tower building, new road/highway/Bridge/property developments are on project basis. It business structure branches out nicely to reduce risk of slow down in particular sector. Net borrowing stood at RM100M.
3) Institution investers or PP holders will shun this counter.
*** be prepared RI on the card. Dilution of shares.
the only O&G listed company I can think off to staged remarkable recovery is Hibiscus from SPAC (ZERO) to discovery of oil in Northern basin that recently declared dividend.
*** even than price of Hibiscus is still shy of its all time high around 2.8 and the time it takes to recover from lowest of 0.13 till today.
SD already gave a big clue proir SIR announcement :
1) CEO as Head of entity cum biggest shareholder behave like primary school boy to with hold his report card( many F and E) from parents. Suppose to be ready by 30th September.
2) shoplot Chairman, the loudspeaker act like church mouse. If good news, will be like Ayam bertelur riuh sekampong.
Only 1 man to blame :
Kasi Anda Ribuan Impian Malang!
He use kasi instead of bagi/beri as he is Is.... CONvert.

Part A 传统生意
1) 洋灰Segment~垄断全砂市场是大哥大没人能够威胁他（近期洋灰起价对他有利，当然成本也跟着起价）
2）建筑材料 Trading Segment ~ 基本上砂州的基建材料都是他一手包办的。
3) 道路建筑和维护Segment ~ : 从子公司变成JV联营生意模式。 CMSB 占了49% PPES Works Sdn Bhd, 另外的51% 由 SEDC (Sarawak Economic Development Corporation)。SEDC不就是代表砂州政府咯。反正多买2%给SEDC 名义上是SEDC是大股东，其实是由CMSB管理层去管理的。呵呵，当然是为了更名正言顺的拿到砂州道路合约嘛。。也是属于垄断整个砂州的道路市场。
4) 房地产Segment ~ 不甘寂寞什么都要插一脚就对了，年年有钱赚。
Part B 策略投资生意
1) 电信塔基建和维护 Segment ~ SACOFA 是垄断全砂telecommunications tower 的公司。业务为建造电讯塔并向telco (celcom, maxis, digi 等) 出租 。
股权分布
CMSB 占有50% SACOFA, State Financial Secretary (砂政府) 拥 20.51%, Celcom 拥 15.12%, Sains 拥 7.57%, Yayasan Sarawak 拥 (6.80%)
5G 建设对他有利，也没对手。有也是弱鸡。
2) OM Sdn Bhd 是和 OM Holdings (Australia Listed Company) 在Samalaju Industrial的一个合资，主要生产 Ferrosilicon Alloys & Manganese Alloys. 厂房坐落在Samalaju重工业区，隔壁就是Pmetal啦。好处就是能够享用廉价的电力，低电费又能剩一笔了。呵呵
近期Ferrosilicon Alloys & Manganese Alloys的期货价钱升的很离谱。这个Segment 会大赚啦。
股权分布
CMSB 持有25%，75%由OM Australia 拥有。
4) Malaysia Phosphate Additives ～生产 Phosphate 和其他化肥产品。反正用途很广，工业，肥料，食品对会用到它啦。目前还没营运，因为MCO的关系严重影响到厂房建设的进度。不过2021尾会开始投入营运。
股权分布
CMSB 持有60%。
5) Kenanga, KKB 不多说。反正赚钱。
6) 砂劳越土保党一日不倒CMSB都会捞的满满啦。
7) 基本都是垄断生意，年年赚钱。
8) 管理层信心满满能够在2024年达到税前盈利 500m。
9) 股价已经从国阵执政期间高峰期一直滑落到现在徘徊在1.4块左右。从2018年希盟执政开始不被看好因为白毛可能被起诉，土保党的心连国阵所以被投资者无理的抛售，2020年又因为Covid，2021又因为 CFO 的问题，呵呵。现在这个价位真的物有所值！！！！
10) 看好国阵，UMNO会在下个选举旗开得胜。到时候CMSB就会如日中天！！！呵呵。
注意：
除非土保党输了州选，呵呵应该没可能。"

Do not too obsess with the outcome and miss out the fundamental which I believe is the driving force 4 share price 2 recovery. Alleged fraud already past tense.
When CMS traded around 1.1 in July 21 i ask myself ' wtf happens to this company?'
The 1st thing I did was a quick fundamental screen before moving into news of the alleged issues.
I'm glad to share it to u today as below.
How strong is CMSB?
29th Oct 21, the government will introduce a ONE-OFF corporate tax of 33 percent for any income after RM100 million(profit be4 tax) for the year 2022.
- out of all KLSE components, 2 companies fail to make it which are Genting and GenM that had badly effected by pandemic.
How's other fares, I choose a few techs darling for comparison :
1) MI - 44.3m(2018), 52.9m(19), 54m(20), 48.6m(21 until 3rd qr)
2) UWC - 18.9m(2019), 57.8m(20), 91.5m(21)
3) Penta - 57.1m(18), 83m, 70.9m, 53.5m (3qrs)
Where else 4 CMS :
265.7m(2018), 160.3m, 194.7m, 125.2m( until Q2)
*** pls take note that all figures are PAT ( After 24% tax deduction) and I choose tech cos it bullish outperform income due to shortage supply that enjoys it best valuation currently.
Conclusion : the above companies still need some catch up and our CMS already qualify in just 2 quarter. Alamak! Taxman coming 4 more. UWC 2021 admitted.
The new tax is call ' cukai makmur' in BM, which means CMS has been prosperous since many years back and many more to come. Lucky no back dated calculation, hahaha!
STRENGTH TO STRENGTH COMPARISON :
*** used 4 rolling qr eps and compare with on PAR companies across industry best. All are The edge BRC ( Billions Ringgit Club) as benchmark.
1) CMSB - 26.61 eps @ 1.43
2) Inari (tech/semicon) - 8.96 @ 3.87
3) Dialog (o&g) - 9.62 @ 2.830
4) PMETAL (industrial) - 8.99 @ 5.56
5) VS (tech/EMS) - 6.41 @ 1.58
6) ABMB (finance) - 25.87 @ 2.75
in order for Inari shareholders to equalize the efficiency of CMS annually eps ( the amount of net profit earn per single share), investor need to buy 26.61/8.96= 2.97 x (X amount of shares needed) to achieve same earning.
3.87 x 2.97 = 11.49 ( amount invested)
1.43/11.49 = 0.13 ( just fractional amount inari value at)
Same goes to 3,4,5 and very near to ABMB.
*** CMSB deserves the conglomerate title and didn't lose face at all if standing side by side with these best of the best. My TP 2.0 is not merely pluck from sky. Most important is futures results, PAT just more than 30m per qr. Why I say 30m, because give more market also fail to appreciate it, lol!
Legal investigation will only be 3rd after shock ( earthquake synology). Blast is when news of 'fraud' amplifier by SD where most investors in dark. 2nd wave was KPMG hints out the the possibles cause and estimated damage and calm market down.
That's why I say : BUYING CMS FUTURE!!
Q2 as (heart stabilize/comfort) pills had assured fundamental are intact. Q3 expecting soon (outperform results) more important than finding.
stay neutral and think for yourself, bet or not."

If extra 9% is too much to swallow, one can turn to companies ( gross profit less than 100m), unstable/fluctuating earning companies where there is room for tax deferral. Best still constantly lost making 1, no need pay tax. Want tips on these type of companies?
1st 100m profits is just general guideline. For sure there are Clauses like lost transfers among associations/subsidiaries, sudden purchase of luxury assets and etc. Marginal corporates can engage Tax Consultants for advices but biggest earning companies how to run?. Tax consultant can help reduce taxable amount on marginal companies but not 100% tax obligation relief on extra tax rate. Anything involve transactions involves loan, stamp duties, RPGT, contracts so other parties still pay taxes. Dun copy bad apple way in tempering accounts. Be patriotic and treat this as 1 time National Service for Malaysia.
*** according to Bloomberg data, there are only 125 companies qualify for it. ( CMS kena, best company mah). Should learned from Tan Sri Teh by asking serious question to FM :
"" entra 1 OFF mo man Thai, but how can government assure tax payers the accountability, transparency, in distribution of funds among people and effected economy sectors. How it will benefits recovery rate and the growth projection in term of GDP on larger prospective. ""
Factors determine the upward movement of CMS share price :
1) how well can cahaya produce profits. EPS, growth rate, sustainability are key measurements.
2) how serious BOD uphold the rule of law's in bringing those culprit to justice.
3) best practice of upholding best ESG codes to avoid reoccurrence.

Price stays when raw material adjust lower.
Cement is a control item. It's std across Malaysia but normally east Malaysia distributors are allow to charge extra to cover logistic cost.
This ceiling price increase is inevitable cos local producer eg Mcement, Hume industry already operating under extremely challenging environment. 1 reason is raw materials price catching up fast.
*** this isn't the case for CMS as it bundled it products in projects. High margins in government is an open secret, just compare net margin for CMS with Mcement or others.

Prior to covid, the company's has not been traded below RM2 since 2013 (after adjusting to the bonus issue exercise in 2014). It fell under RM2 during the first MCO but managed to rebound back in the 1st half of 2021.
It fall back to under RM2 and reaching to as low as RM1.05 after the governance issue of its construction arm PPES Work (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd emerge in May. As of Dec 2020, PPES NTA is only RM80mil which means CMSB exposure to PPES is only RM40mil (CMSB owns 49% of PPES, the remaining 51% is owned by the Sarawak State).
Even if the outcome of the report is negative and CMSB has to write off the whole of PPES, the amount of exposure is only RM40mil vs its NTA of RM2.9bil. This only represent a mere 1.4% of the company's equity.
Which is why it think that the market might be over reacting a bit with the governance issue.
On top of that the 2022 budget is highly beneficial to the Sarawak state which would also benefit CMSB given the Sarawak State government direct exposure in the company.
Near term positive catalyst would emerge post KPMG report finding if it shows that the exposure to CMSB is minimal. I would assume that CMSB would potentially rebound back to above RM2 level. Hopefully they can finalize the findings by the end of November."

2021, 3 June 2021, 8 June 2021, 2 August 2021, 30 August 2021 and 29 October 2021 on the
suspension of Mr Syed Hizam Alsagoff, the Group Chief Financial Officer of the Company and the
appointment of KPMG Management & Risk Consulting Sdn Bhd (“KPMG MRC”) as the independent
consultant to review the financial management of certain investment and projects, we furnish herewith
the following information on the matter.
1. The key findings of the Special Review Report by the appointed consultant KPMG MRC as
instructed by the Board on the three projects (“Said Projects”) in the Associates, Subsidiaries and
Joint Ventures of CMSB are as follows:
 There were gaps in the contract management and bidding processes contributing to a project’s
losses;
 Lack of monitoring by the Associate’s Board on the hedging transactions of a certain project
which ended in losses due to adverse currency exchange movements;
 There was a lack of due diligence and stakeholder management on the joint venture partners’
risks of a project; and
 The reporting structures by Management to the Board were not adhered to and complied with
in a project.
2. The realized losses incurred had been accounted for in the past financial results.
3. Based on the key findings above, an external lawyer has been appointed to look at the various
issues that have arisen and to advise CMSB on all legal issues that arise in particular in relation
to the conduct of senior management at that material time.
4. Further to the report the Board has taken immediate steps and measures over the last few months
to strengthen the Company’s operations and processes:
 In this regard the Board has initiated a review of the reporting and realigning of the Group
structure with the aim to ensure the internal controls and risk management processes are
strengthened including promoting transparency and accountability as follows:
● strengthening Risk Oversight at the Board level, with the main function is to provide
oversight on enterprise material risk and provide updates on key projects on a periodic
manner so that the Board will be appraised of such risk matters on a continuous basis.
 In this connection CMSB will have an independent Group Risk Division to drive the risk plan
for the entire organization.
 A culture of governance and growth across the Group will be actively pursued by the Board to
strengthen the accountability and integrity at all levels of Senior Management.
 Initiation of operational improvements including improving project bidding processes, tightening
of control over project costs and strengthening of project management.
 Recruitment of additional senior management including the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Technical
Officer, Head of Compliance, Chief of Staff (to oversee the Human capital transformation).
Page 2 of 2
 Setting up of Investment Committee chaired by Group Managing Director to review and
recommend all proposals and investments to the Board for information and approval as
appropriate.
 Improving the reporting process by investing and implementing an Enterprise Resource
Planning (“ERP”) system to streamline information and data flows.
 Appointment of new Group Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”). An extensive search for a new
Group CFO with the relevant capabilities, experience, credibility and strong credentials is ongoing. Meanwhile Madam Tan Mei Fung will continue as Head of Finance pending the
appointment of the new CFO is complete in due course."
