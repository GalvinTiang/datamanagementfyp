We tweak our forecast to incorporate the performance in 4QFY18. However, we are maintaining our BUY call and 12-month TP of RM5.15 (based on an unchanged 27x 2019E PER), as we still believe in Kossan’s growth prospects. Kossan also remains our top BUY pick for the sector and country.

Ringgit seen at 4.15 against US dollar by end-2019 — Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Tan Xue Ying
theedgemarkets.com
March 06, 2019 12:11 pm +08
KUALA LUMPUR (March 6): Bank of America Merrill Lynch sees the ringgit weakening to 4.15 against the US dollar by year-end as the Malaysian currency is deemed sensitive to China's economic growth story.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch director Rohit Garg, however, said Malaysia's stable exports are expected to mitigate the ringgit's weakness. He said Malaysia is the only country that has not seen much downward pressure on exports, but instead benefits from the trade diversion due to the US-China trade tension.
He said this is evident especially in Malaysia's electronic and electric exports.
""For Malaysia, things have actually turned out to be better than what I was actually expecting. We are not really expecting much weakness in the ringgit. There will be a little weakness as it is definitely a bit more sensitive in terms of how China growth actually evolves.
""From current levels, we are expecting the ringgit to weaken to 4.15 (against the greenback) by the end of the year,"" he said during a panel session at the Palm & Lauric Oils Price Outlook Conference & Exhibition 2019 here today.
At 11:26am today, the ringgit weakened to 4.0883 against the US dollar after China announced yesterday its economic growth forecast revision.
Reuters reported that China lowered its economic growth target for this year to between 6% and 6.5%, as expected, from around 6.5% last year. It was reported that China offered more stimulus, including cuts in taxes and social security fees, increases in infrastructure investment and lending to small firms."

1)The most undervalue glove stock with low PE 23.3 compare with Harta PE 37 Top Glove PE 29
2)Third largest (26.5B) in the world behind top glove 58B and Harta 30B
By 2019, it will increase the output from 26.5bil to 32bil (Plant 18 and Plant 19) with 20% growth and possible surpass Harta.
3)The only glove stock that record double digit growth in recently quarter result
4)Most IB upgraded the target price after Kossan perform superb result in latest Q1
Maybank : Target Price RM4.70 (Upside 23%)
Hong Leong : Target Price RM4.35 (Upside 13.9%)
Cimb : Target Price RM4.52 (Upside 17.5%)
Affin : Target Price RM6.00 (Upside 57%)
Public Bank: Target Price RM4.30 (Upside 12.6%)
MIDF : Target Price RM4.53 (Upside 16.6%)
Kenanga : Target Price RM5.25 (Upside 35.3%)
Personal TP: Target Price RM4.60 based on pe 20 and RM5.75 based on pe 25
5)After 2020, there are further expansion 48bil from 2020 to 2028 in Bidor
Why I so bullish on the glove stock is trade war will shift the supply from China to Malaysia. Gloves in China are more expensive by 25% and there are no price advantage between PVC and nitrile.
Global Demand is 300bil and Malaysia dominate the global demand by 63% and China (10%). The shift of 10% (30bil) demand from China to Malaysia will spur the growth and expansion in Malaysia. Biggest winner is major player nitrile glove which is Harta (90% nitrile) and Kossan (75% nitrile)"

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001389.jsp?ftp=42","Jul 31, 2019 6:02 PM","Chelsea","This coming Q2 I forecast double digit growth 30%
Why Kossan is the long term investment with huge upside?
1)The most undervalue glove stock with low PE 23.3 compare with Harta PE 37 Top Glove PE 29
2)Third largest (26.5B) in the world behind top glove 58B and Harta 30B
By 2019, it will increase the output from 26.5bil to 32bil (Plant 18 and Plant 19) with 20% growth and possible surpass Harta.
3)The only glove stock that record double digit growth in recently quarter result
4)Most IB upgraded the target price after Kossan perform superb result in latest Q1
Maybank : Target Price RM4.70 (Upside 23%)
Hong Leong : Target Price RM4.35 (Upside 13.9%)
Cimb : Target Price RM4.52 (Upside 17.5%)
Affin : Target Price RM6.00 (Upside 57%)
Public Bank: Target Price RM4.30 (Upside 12.6%)
MIDF : Target Price RM4.53 (Upside 16.6%)
Kenanga : Target Price RM5.25 (Upside 35.3%)
Personal TP: Target Price RM4.60 based on pe 20 and RM5.75 based on pe 25
5)After 2020, there are further expansion 48bil from 2020 to 2028 in Bidor
Why I so bullish on the glove stock is trade war will shift the supply from China to Malaysia. Gloves in China are more expensive by 25% and there are no price advantage between PVC and nitrile.
Global Demand is 300bil and Malaysia dominate the global demand by 63% and China (10%). The shift of 10% (30bil) demand from China to Malaysia will spur the growth and expansion in Malaysia. Biggest winner is major player nitrile glove which is Harta (90% nitrile) and Kossan (75% nitrile)"

Kossan ups stake in Cleanera for RM6.5m, sees potential in cleanroom tech in China

KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 4): Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd has bought another 26.97% stake in clean-room product trader Cleanera HK Ltd, raising its shareholding in the company to 82%.
It bought the additional stake from Midori Anzen Co Ltd for RM6.5 million, Kossan said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia.
The acquisition, it said, was based on Cleanera’s net asset rising to HK$9.83 per share according to its audited financial statements in 2016, from HK$7.98 as per its initial investment in 2011.
Kossan also quoted an article in Cleanroom Technology magazine, which stated that the Chinese Institute of Electronics forecast that China’s clean room engineering industry is expected to increase to 126.85 billion yuan (RM77.88 billion) in 2018 from 43.24 billion yuan in 2012 or a compound annual growth rate of 19.65%.
“With the increased shareholding of 82% in Cleanera, Kossan would have better leeway in charting Cleanera’s growth into China’s booming clean room market,” it said.
Kossan’s shares closed up six sen or 0.78% at RM7.75 today for a market capitalisation of RM4.95 billion."

https://www.facebook.com/117300344947762/posts/3076943132316787/
--------------------------------------------------
The first batch of one million pieces of gloves is departing to Wuhan aboard AirAsia flight commissioned by the government to bring back Malaysians from Wuhan today.
This is the first batch of medical gloves to be sent after my announcement on the donation of 18 million medical gloves to China last week.
The one million pieces of latex examination gloves packed in specially designed boxes by Supermax Glove Manufacturing Sdn Bhd will be received by Hubei Charity Federation – a Chinese government-designated donation recipient.
Hubei Charity Federation will distribute the medical glove supply to healthcare facilities in Wuhan.
The gloves are being transported via a special flight that will bring back 132 people comprising 108 Malaysians and 24 non-citizens who were their spouses and children from Wuhan, China.
As said by the Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Wan Azizah Wan Ismail only those who have been certified healthy after undergoing an exit screening by the local authorities at the Wuhan Tianhe International Airport will be brought back.
The Malaysian Government is aware for the need for fast response and with the coordination with the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Malaysia, the National Disaster Management Agency (NADMA), Malaysian Rubber Export Promotion Council (MREPC) and Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association (MARGMA) have managed to send aid with utmost urgency.
We are deeply thankful for AirAsia enabling such a quick response to our Government’s request to bring Malaysian home from Wuhan and to transport the urgent medical gloves supply to the healthcare workers in Wuhan who are managing a very large, complex situation.
The next batch of another one million medical gloves is scheduled to be sent to Wuhan on board of MASkargo this Wednesday.
As I have announced last Friday, the Malaysian Rubber Export Promotion Council (MREPC) and nine rubber glove manufacturers in Malaysia have stepped forward to pledge 18 million pieces of medical gloves to Wuhan.
Besides Supermax, the other companies are Smart Glove, Top Glove, Hartalega, Kossan, YTY, Brightway, Koon Seng and Careplus.

You can check the records for Top Glove for the past 6 months - EPF exits before uptrend. Doesn't mean they don't own the stock, just that they are not deemed substantial shareholder so probably don't need to report transactions and can trade freely (my assumption). As for Kossan... looking at historical, it is definitely the odd one vs the rest. Top Glove and Harta are the bullish stocks. Supermax is the more speculative and explosive one. Kossan is the laggard and odd child. BUT -- so far it has gone up along with Top Glove and Harta during bull runs. So for this reason, I would hold on to it. If possible, it would be better to hold a basket of different glove stocks with lower weightage on Kossan but I won't ditch it.

11 JAN 2018 / 21:02 H.
PETALING JAYA: Glove-dipping line manufacturer HLT Global Bhd has proposed to acquire HL Rubber Industries Sdn Bhd (HLRI) for RM33 million, in a move which will see it diversify into the rubber gloves manufacturing business.
HLRI is primarily engaged in the manufacturing and trading of rubber gloves, including both natural and synthetic rubber gloves for customers in the medical, food and beverage as well as consumer industries amongst others.
In a statement yesterday, HLT said it has entered into a heads of agreement with Suntel International Co Ltd, Kan Mei Yoong and Lee Sow Yin for the proposed acquisition of 5.77 million ordinary shares, representing 55% of the issued share capital of HLRI.
The group said the purchase consideration will be satisfied via the issuance of 113.8 million new ordinary shares in HLT at an issue price of 29 sen per consideration share.
“As a company, it is only natural that we aim to establish a stronger foothold in the industry and we view this exercise as synergistic and complementary to our existing fabrication business of glove-dipping lines,” HLT’s executive director and CEO Chan Yoke Chun said.
“Exports from Malaysia accounts for a lion’s share of the global market consumption hence, we aim to leverage on this opportunity and penetrate into new markets both regionally and internationally,” he added.
Moving forward, HLT said it continues to seek opportunities in the domestic and international markets by focusing on delivering the highest quality in product and customer service"

The British drugmaker said it had signed the first agreements to supply at least 400 million doses of the vaccine, which it is developing with Oxford University.
It said it recognised the vaccine might not work but if results from the early stage tests were positive, they would lead to late stage trials in several countries.
Only a handful of the vaccines in development have advanced to human trials, an indicator of safety and efficacy, and the stage at which most fail.
There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for COVID-19 being tested by pharmaceutical giants across the world, with governments, drugmakers and researchers working on around 100 programmes and experts predicting a safe and effective means of preventing the disease could take 12 to 18 months to develop.
AstraZeneca also said in a statement that it had received more than $1 billion from the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority for development, production and delivery of the potential vaccine.
It said the COVID-19 vaccine it was testing would include a planned late-stage clinical trial with 30,000 participants and a paediatric trial, adding that it planned to start supplying the vaccine in Britain in September.
Other drugmakers including Pfizer Inc , Johnson"

The research house has raised its earnings projection for Kossan by 62% to RM498.3 million for FY20, 62% to RM460.6 million for FY21 and 9% to RM337.9 million for FY22.
Aminvestment has maintained its ""buy"" rating on Kossan with a higher fair value of RM9.72 based on a P/E of 27x FY21F EPS.
The upward projection came after the rubber glover maker posted its first quarter earnings, which the research house deemed to be “in line with expectations”.
In the first quarter ended March 31, 2020 (1QFY20), Kossan posted core profit after tax and minority interest (PATAMI) of RM64.2 million, accounting for 21% and 23% of its and the consensus full-year expectations respectively.
AmInvestment Bank said glove demand arising from Covid-19 began to jump from April onwards. This resulted in a supply constraint and subsequently drove selling prices higher.
Kossan has received orders close to 10 months ahead of delivery with prices to be finalized one to two months prior to delivery.
“We like Kossan for its expansionary plans and efforts in improving quality and operational efficiency as well as increasing automation. Moving forward, we expect a stronger performance for the year due to the increased demand from Covid-19 pandemic further buoyed by its expansion plans,” the report said.
Despite the stellar 1QFY20 result announced yesterday, Kossan shares fell 6.54% or 53 sen to RM8.10 shortly after the opening bell today.
At 9.30am, Kossan pared some of its losses at RM8.48, still down 15 sen or 1.74%, bringing it some market capitalisation of RM11.04 billion."

We have seen a strong and bullish rally for all stocks related to the rubber glove sector in the last 3 weeks. This was prompted by the terrific results of Big4 this week.
How much longer can the rally go? Nobody knows, but judging from signs such as the participation in the recent movement by smallish glove makers ie Comfort, Carepls and Ruberex and also the appearance of the inverted hammer in the hourly chart of Harta and Kossan, the top may be very near. I believe it is time to take some profit in this sector.
My Bets: The potential upside may be limited for Big4 glove stocks which may have now fairly priced despite IB's favorable rating and extremely highly target priced.
Huat Huat ARRR! Happy Trading !!"

According to 'Dr. No', vaccine is still not available, it's 'For Your Eyes Only'. Most pharmaceutical companies have used the 'Live and Let Die' method. Sometimes you will experience 'Die Another Day' & sometimes you can only hope for 'You Only Live Twice'.
'The World Is Not Enough' with gloves, so our glove companies operate 24 hours a day with 'No Time To Die' in producing the gloves. 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service', our gloves was sent to NHS UK. 'From Russia with Love', our gloves was delivered to Moscow hospitals. Everyone is using our gloves including' The Spy Who Loved Me'.
In 'The Living Daylights', we 'Never Say Never Again' to glove counters that command high PE. We as an investor, must have the 'GoldenEye' in selecting the best glove counter, sharp & precise like 'The Man with the Golden Gun'.
From the 'Goldfinger' of uncle KYY, glove stocks have rode on 'Moonraker' & skyrocketed amid some occasional 'Thunderball'. Many syndicates & bankers that have 'Licence to Kill' are now eyeing water fish & 'Octopussy' with 'A View To A Kill'.
Stay invested, all must believe 'Diamonds Are Forever' & ' Tomorrow Never Dies'. Do not play contra as in 'Casino Royale'. Always buy on dip to ensure that you won't 'Skyfall' and felt 'Quantum of Solace' with the fluctuating market'."

Supermax can be chasing up because supermax is the earlier to increase it selling price. But coming forward i heard all glove company (previously not increase price yet) will be increase price in June 2020. Giving Kossan production capacity 31billion versus supermax 27.4 billion still have room to goes up."

Topglove and supermax have own distributor in certain area can sell at retail price but it is only 10% to 20% volume. This is is increase selling price about doubled / ctn but for the total volume case. So, the earning is going to explode even higher."

1. Vaccine trials are running in China but proper tests will definitely take time (You won't wanna take a product that gives you immunity for current Covid viruses but unable to tackle newer strains when product is released.)
2. You also won't wanna take a vaccine that gives you immunity now but side effects that only develops much later on (e.g dengue vaccines withdrawn in Philippines due to incidences of severe diseases resulting in death)
I don't think gloves are overvalued if outbreaks are still happening worldwide (not taking into account second or third waves yet). Gloves are not just used in healthcare but also in labs and various practises with mass human contact. The new norm will escalate the usage of gloves to an unprecedented level.
Hope to accumulate more this week."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001389.jsp?ftp=62","Jun 1, 2020 11:55 PM","Mabel","I entered the Gloves Industry when our Government announced that we are donating 18 million Gloves to China to fight C19 early this year.
That announcement by Teresa compelled to starts investing on Gloves. I decided to take her call after what she did to help our Plantation which is generating good margin at that time. Beside my O&G selections were also doing great.
So it's time to give back. Harta was the first company that came in mind based on kk7168 recommendation when we were engaged together in Greatec. This investment is followed with Top Gloves, Kossan and eventually Supermax before the rally starts.
Yes I agree all rubber stocks are now over value. Gloves currently is currently overbought...PE has already exploded way above Malaysian average
Top Glove = PE 106
Hartalega: 92
Kossan = PE 51
Supermx = PE 77
These Fantastic Four (Top Glove, Hartalega, Kossan and Supermax price) continue to climb none stop. The main reason is because all of them provide 100% medical gloves. There is a worldwide shortage medical glove.
Let's evaluate the Pros and Cons
Pros
Global demand for rubber gloves is estimated to reach 300 billion gloves this year, with an expected annual growth of 12%. Of that, 188 billion gloves will be produced by Malaysia which is the world’s largest producer and the leading exporter of rubber gloves, contributing 63% of the global supply. Most of the supply are coming from these Fantastic Four.
Everyone seems to say that Gloves counter are now overvalued. Here's the irony part, IB seems to be revising their TP upwards all the time..
According to Bloomberg data updated in May, there were 12 “buys” and 1 “hold” recommendations for Top Glove, with target prices (TPs) ranging from RM9.20 to RM20.50, implying further upside to its share price judging by the best-case estimate. Top Gloves closed today at RM 16.84.
Meanwhile, for Hartalega, there were eight “buys”, 11 “holds” and three “sells” recommendations, with TPs ranging from RM5.95 to RM16:50. Hartalega closed today at RM 13.18
Year to date, Hartalega’ share price has surged by some 140%, while Top Glove shares have leapt by a staggering 242%.
Industrial glove still excessive supply with low margin profit. Top Glove and Hartalega will go up to RM 100 per share in 5-year time.. Both will have a chance to be listed on Nasdaq and potential of USD 100 Billion market capitalisation in due time.
The market capitalisation (market cap) of nitrile glove manufacturer Hartalega Bhd, founded by Kuan, is RM31.11 billion and has exceeded that of most of the local banks, except for Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank), Public Bank Bhd and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd.
In fact, Hartalega’s market cap is more than the combined market cap of five banks: Affin Bank Bhd; Alliance Bank Bhd; MBSB Bank, which is owned by Malaysia Building Society Bhd; AmBank, which is owned by AMMB Holdings Bhd, and Bank Islam, owned by BIMB Holdings Bhd.
Likewise, the market cap for Lim’s Top Glove Bhd, in which he owns 35.95%, has soared to RM26.41 billion, larger than that of some of the bluest blue chips, including IOI Corp Bhd, Petronas Dagangan Bhd and PPB Group Bhd.
Even the market cap of Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd and Supermax Corp Bhd have exceeded that of some of the local banks even though the banking business is far more capital-intensive than the manufacturers and the barriers to entry are much higher.
Suddenly, all these Fantastic Four are performing much better than our Established Banks.
Cons
Looking from outside, valuation of glove co is difficult to determine now as there are too many variables like ASP (average selling price), raw material price of nitrile and rubber , the exchange rate and most important composition of percentage of each sold to regular customers and spot customers. In addition, the spare capacity available before the run up of demand would determine extend of extra profit.
So back to your point, sell if you must to lock your profits. Whenever possible, do not sell all so that you can continue to enjoy this rally.
For me, it's nice when you have all the Fantastic 4 in your collection. It's a very healthy race.. Just like the race between Armada and KNM and the race between Serbadk and Dayang..
Summing up..
Earlier, some smart Alex were saying SELL in May and Go Away...
They forget, it's freezing cold up in the North Poles...Santa Gloves actually came to town in May...
These Fantastic Four Gloves Counters rockets like no business in May...
So when these smart Alex came back today in June all the Gloves trains have left..
Always stay invested and continue contributing to the Global Community. YOU will get rewards from all direction.. Trust me...

When the crude oil price increase, crack spread will be narrow but the demand will increase, demand increase and the sales of volume will increase , so overall increase the profit.

So for eg, if a money manager has a 10% cap on exposure to a single stock (different internal policies and SOPs for different firms), money managers have to gradually unload stocks in their portfolios as the stock price goes up as it will breach the 10% cap. So the more the price goes up, you will see more gradual selling.
You may also see some buying from the same party for other portfolios.

KUALA LUMPUR (June 6): The market craze for glove stocks continued despite the margin call curbs by brokerages early last week, which led to a massive sell-off.
While some said the high valuations — historical price-earnings ratios (PERs) of over 100 times — were crazy, it did not stop research houses from giving higher target prices (TPs) for glove stocks in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.
For instance, Credit Suisse was the most optimistic, raising its TP for Top Glove Corp Bhd to RM23, representing another 40.4% upside against its last Friday’s closing price of RM16.38. Note that the stock has surged over 200% year to date (YTD).
Low-liner Careplus Group Bhd has even seen its share price surge close to 1,000% since early this year.
Will the strong buying interest cause a glove bubble? Are the hefty premium valuations justified? Would it be time to pick up glove stocks after a correction?
We speak to industry players, analysts and fund managers to find out what they think about the demand and earnings outlook, as well as the bull factors and key risks for the sector.
As countries around the globe are racing to develop a vaccine against Covid-19, it remains to be seen how it will affect glove demand. In the post-pandemic era, new structural changes could also take place.
In our accompanying stories, we also take a look at how the wealth of the founders of glove companies has soared over the last five months; and the two businessesmen who have made handsome gains from their recent investments in a glove firm.
All of these are part of our cover story in the latest issue of The Edge Malaysia weekly."

It has gone to the point of cheating. Cheating on last Mon and Tuesday. Cheating today.
I was giving the shark or the IB chance more time to end at least a 1% win. To sooth the retailer, at least 1% win on 350 mil profit result day. If the IB is not generous enough with at least 1% win on TG result day with explosive quarters, better keep your cash and don’t play. At least you don’t lose. 95% of retail investors lose money.
Run from all the glove counter, it has passed what I believe free market is.
No point you join the game. If they don’t want to play with you.
If shark or IB don’t have the retailer to play with them, they profit nothing.
My supporters, I am sorry but to ask you to run from all glove. I am beyond angry.
No need to look at fundamental when cheating is per say.
I don’t support cheating.
No need say it will reach there sooner or later. Boycott the shark and IB. See how much money you can win.
I have withdrew all my 1.9million value of glove stock. I am currently at 50k loss.
Top glove boss have asked their employee to buy the stock. What kind of boss says that? When the employee lose big on buying their stock. Of course smiling his way to the bank.
No need consult me on fundamental because it doesn’t apply in Malaysia anyway."

Kim's Stockwatch
PART 2 : GLOVES SECTOR - THIS IS MY REAL PLAN ON PHASE II FY20 - FY21
So today as we all know and expected Top Glove Bhd released its excellent and superb quaterly financial result. With strong worldwide demand for rubber gloves amid the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unsurprising that Top Glove Corp Bhd has recorded its best-ever quarterly net profit in the third quarter ended May 31, 2020 (3QFY20)
Top Glove executive director Lim Cheong Guan said strong orders and demand are expected to continue for the next one to two years. In 3QFY20, sales of nitrile gloves jumped 47% year-on-year (y-o-y), natural rubber gloves sales leaped 8%, and surgical gloves sales rose 21%.
From here perspective, we already know how good their business is. So as I told many times Gloves Sector already applied in ""Defending Stocks Territory"". Also I am agreed some analysts said Top Glove have projected a net profit of as high as RM3 billion for FY21 So if they really can archieved that of course and definitely my last target RM35 surely hit FY21."

1. ""BUY IN JUNE HISTORY WILL REPEAT PREVIOUS APRIL""
- Today we had received very clear signal. We can buyback / Addmore cheap gloves. Follow the waves you will be safe in the ocean.
- Today also I saw many new retailers those bought high cutloss because not have holding power.
- Gloves, for sure now you cant do daytrade. It not easier like before or previous 6 months.
- Tomorrow I am expect Gloves stock only good performance and will lead the market movement.
- After 6 month gloves performing, now another 6 months to go. As I am expecting Gloves will play role till March 2021. So I am not worried holding as investement till next year.
- My planned as follows :
1 month (Buy) next 5 month (Sell) - January - June FY20
1 month (Buy) next 5 month (Sell) - June - Dec FY20
1 month (Buy) next 3 month (Sell) - Jan - Apr FY21
- I am expecting the profits of quaterly and yearly results. Not base on when this Covid-19 will be end and vaccine will be found. So Big-4 gloves profits already calculating on paper profits FY21."

Your return will be very high...i may not be very surprise, if u can even beat the glove stocks return loh....!

Just agreement to get a first hand on the vaccine when it is available, if that is available, and when that is available. According to Lancet, it takes an average 10 years to come our with a vaccine and 18 months was arguably very very very aggressive. Will take another year or so for manufacturing and distribution and that is why some countries want to get a first hand on it when that is available. Every now and then the media and politicians have to shed some hope and show that they are doing something which in fact, they don't have a definite answer or even slightest idea. Frankly, I would not want to be the guinea pig as well as volunteer myself to be the first to take the vaccine, afraid that it will cause complication in the short term or in the long run like the swine flu vaccine which cause rare disease. I'm pretty healthy and do not want to end up with increase chances of cancer, heart disease, etc or developing other rare disease for no reason while Covid fatality rate is very low and not dangerous but contagious and higher risk for aged and pre-condition group. We have recorded more dengue cases as well as death annually."

My opinion is sell finish kossan and turn to focus on Harta, Topglove and Supermax. When market big drop, market will only focus buying good faudamental company and support the share price. For example Topglove increase high selling price and have spot order, everyone also know September result will very good. Supermax have obm brand, and seling price increases is highest one. Harta now selling price already increase to 70 usd. And have ngc factory and amg glove waiting for FDA certificate. But kossan have what? See back the Bloomberg interview Kossan video, the director say wont increase so much the selling price. If you compare big 4 company, kossan dont have stronger point let market to buy. When ecomic big drop, market very less people will go buy kossan, and you can see the volume everydays is very less. Of course i know kossan is good company, but covid-19 wont come every years, you guys should choose good fundamental and having strong story company to invest, grabe the opportunity.Kossan coming result confirm will good, but the improve of net profit is very less compare to Topglove, Harta and Supermax, than why you want choose Kossan?

- Genting price before CoVid-19 and MCO was RM6, now RM4.50 at the time of writing. One of the few KLCI companies that have yet to reach her previous price. 30% more to go.
- Unlike gloves, nobody 'Goreng' this stock and it is at it's lowest, the only way is up. Furthermore, how much lower can it go? Already PE4.74. Upside is bigger than downside.
- Assuming that you bought and the price drops, it doesn't hurt to hold onto it, right? It is already at the bottom, and it won't drop 50% or 100%. Genting is already at the bottom, if they go any lower, they will be kicked out of KLCI30, that is why Uncle Lim kept on pumping money to support the price.
- With 5% dividend, if you lose 5% in price, can easily recover, hold for 10 years also no worries. And when vaccine is available, price surely will go up more. Only up, no down. Nothing to lose. But gloves, once vaccine is available, you will never ever recover your money again, never.
p.s. Disclosure - I own Genting 3182 stock, does not own GenM. But if you prefer the casino stock, it is also ok. Good luck."

Still remember how steel prices crashed two years back?
Annjoo from almost 4 to 2 in matter of months, and continued to fall to <1. Mind you, the crash started when everyone was expecting the company to make good profits due to good asp. Indeed, the company made good profits, but share price continued to slide. Why?
SIMPLY because stock market looks to the future!!
The peak of pandemic is definitely over. The fuss about the 2nd wave is just an excuse for the market to take a breather after the V-shape surge from the bottom. Everyone everywhere is better prepared, and vaccine will be ready earlier than expected due to billions pumped in the development which uses extraordinary approach. Compared to two months ago, masks and sanitizers are abundant everywhere. Soon, demand for gloves will also normalize. Do you wait until it normalizes to exit?
During the crash of steel counters, investment banks kept giving high TPs which were revised so frequently, each time higher than before. Does this ring a bell?
///// Why Buy Genting (3182)? /////
- PE4.74 only, can Genting go to PE15? (RM13) Maybe, but unlikely. Probably RM6-7, back to pre-covid level. 30%-35% upside.
- Bottom is RM3 (30% from today's pricing), don't think it will go lower than that. Gloves, what is the downside? 200%? 300% 400% down once vaccine is available. Not if, but when. Vaccine will be available by end of the year.
- Genting is cash rich, also have huge debt but manageable.
///// Why No More Lockdown Even With 2nd Wave /////
Lockdown is to buy time to stock up essentials. Now that they've stocked up enough medical supplies, and most people practices social distancing, it is unlikely we will have a 2nd lockdown, this is because it is very damaging to the economy.
Look at Iran, they have a 2nd wave but decided not to lockdown anymore knowing how damaging it can be for the economy. People will die of hunger. Poverty rate shoots up, crime up and etc.... This is the new normal. Don't be the last person to hold the bag. The PE for gloves are too crazy."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001389.jsp?ftp=67","Jun 18, 2020 12:10 AM","SK1008","NEW CALL WARRANTS - BIG TRAP by IBs (Investment Bankers)
Do not buy HARTA C46 & C47 tomorrow. CALCULATE THE PREMIUM BEFORE YOU BUY!!
All the IBs are trapping the investors with high risk call warrants of very high premiums.
CALL WARRANTS SHOULD BE REGULATED BY BURSA. PROFESSIONAL IBs ARE TRAPPING MANY IGNORANT INVESTORS.
IBs are bankers, they control and manipulate the prices.
On the 1st day of listing, they already trapped all the buyers with warrants of very high premium by setting very high bid and ask price.
Take a look at Kossan C8
Exercise Price : 14.50
Exercise Ratio : 13:1
Listing Date : 16/6/2020
Maturity Date : 29/1/2021
Life Span : 7.5 months warrant
I will calculate the premium in reference to the closing price of Kossan (RM 8.19) 1 day before listing that is 15/6/2020.(assumption only)
On 16/6/2020 listing date.
C8 opening price 0.30, premium = [(0.30 x 13)+ 14.50]/8.19 = 2.24, in other words 124% premium.
C8 closing price 0.20, premium = [(0.20 x 13)+ 14.50]/8.19 = 2.08, in other words 108% premium.
Today, Kossan mother price is the only Glove counter in green, closing at 8.40 (Apparently propped up by IB to give a good picture)
C8 closing price 0.19, premium = [(0.19 x 13)+ 14.50]/8.40 = 2.02, in other words 102% premium.
For the warrant to be in the money, the mother share must move up to = (0.19 x 13)+ 14.50
= 16.97
Do you honestly believe Kossan will achieve 16.97 by maturity date of 29/1/2021, only 7.5 months down the road. For you to make money, Kossan will have to close above 16.97 on the day of maturity.
VERY VERY DIFFICULT !! So the only way now is for C8 to continue to drift lower and lower.
First day transaction record of Kossan C8 on 16/6/2020
Open : 0.30
High : 0.30
Low : 0.185
Closed:0.20
Volume: 22.419M
C8 Warrant Issue Size : 20M
On the 1st day, all 20M shares are initially in the hands of IB could have been sold.
So assume IB sold all the shares at prices of 0.185-0.30, say average 0.25.
The IB netted RM 5M in the 1st day. Great!
All buyers will be losers.
Similar modus operandi is happening for Supermex C93 & Top Glove C76 & Top Glove C78
Supermex C93 listed on 11/6/2020 (expiring in 8.5 months)
Price drifted from high of 0.59 to 0.31 (62% premium) today.
Top Glove C76 listed on 4/6/2020 (expiring in 12.0 months)
Price drifted from high of 1.05 to 0.53 (49.9% premium) today.
Top Glove C78 listed on 11/6/2020 (expiring in 8.5 months)
Price drifted from high of 0.75 to 0.515 (54.8% premium) today.
Now,they make their warrant penny to attract investors like Kossan C8 by configuring a very high exercise ratio of 13 and high exercise price of 14.0,thereby magnifying the risk.
BEWARE and DONT CHASE THE NEW CALL WARRANTS, CALCULATE THE PREMIUM BEFORE YOU BUY!!"

1) Kossan being the laggard still cheap in comparison to all others already flown up the sky
So Kossan will play catch up
2) Kossan Top 30 Holders are Local & Foreign Funds
70 over per cent of Kossan shares are strongly held by these long term Funds unlike other Glove companies
ROCK SOLID 70% IN STRONG HANDS (Other gloves very less)
3) EASTSPRING INVESTMENT FUND ALSO IN TOP 30 OF KOSSAN (BUT NOT OTHERS)
Last time when Calvin bought Tmakmur Calvin also saw Kossan people in Top 30 of TMakmur. Tmakmur taken private with generous price.
4) KOSSAN HAS A SECRET PROFIT MAKING WEAPON AS IT HAS ""CLEAN ROOM"" PRODUCTS
CLEAN ROOM PPE SELLING HIGHER PRICES THAN MEDICAL EXAM GLOVES
5) BEST KEPT SECRET > KOSSAN ALSO GOT FACE MASKS OF HIGHEST QUALITY!!
USED IN CLEAN ROOMS
6) REPORTING RESULTS LIKE SUPERMAX IS TILL MARCH 31ST
CAN EXPECT KOSSAN RESULTS TO SPRING BIG SURPRISES
7) EPF ALSO STARTING TO BUY KOSSAN NOW

Topglove create many shift to grab opportunity during this situation but Kossan? Topglove so aggressive to buy and build new factory but Kossan? Always delays? During this covid-19 many glove company so aggressive increase Selling Price but Kossan? Right, kossan also have increase selling price but compare with Topglove, Harta, Supermax than you think yourself!!!! I suggest you see back about Bloomberg interview Kossan Director video and keep repeating Tan Sri answer about the selling price increase part and he say i cant do anything, only can increase abit production. I keep repeat hear and finally i sell finish Kossan and turn into Harta. Harta have AMG glove, ngc factory. Factory 7 maybe will speed up done early at August, will increase more production of glove. Topglove have the world biggest production quantity of glove, the director very expert in doing business, when he talk out he will do it, the spot order price increases 100-500%. Supermax got own obm glove, selling price increases is the highest want, if not wrong now increase until 190 USD, profit margin now is the highest want due to higher selling price. How about Kossan? Kossan can maximum your invest money? Sell it then (turn) your money to Big three ( Topglove, Harta and Supermax), dont waste your time, you must accept the facts.

CALVIN WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION
1) CALVIN BOUGHT SUPERMAX AT RM1.73 ON APRIL 2020
SUPERMAX WAS REALLY SUPERB AND PRICE SHOT UP OVER RM9.00 IN JUST 2 MONTHS TIME
2) ALONG THE WAY MANY HAVE SOLD KOSSAN TO BUY SUPERMAX
3) THEN KOSSAN DIRECTORS & EPF STARTED SELLING KOSSAN TO MAKE THINGS WORST
4) AS A RESULT KOSSAN TRAILED BEHIND ALL OTHER GLOVE STOCK STOCKS AND UNDERPERFORMED
5) NOW THINGS ARE TURNING MORE POSITIVE
A) INSIDERS STOPPED SELLING
B) EPF STARTED BUYING INSTEAD OF SELLING
SO?
SO KOSSAN BEING THE LAGGARD HAS FALLEN LESS THAN THE OTHERS TODAY
KOSSAN IS NOW RESILIENT AND WORTH BUYING AT THIS RETRACED PRICE
DO NOT GO DAY TRADE OR CONTRA PLAY
JUST BUY AND HOLD TILL KOSSAN CROSS RM10.00 OR MORE
IT IS NOT HOW OR WHY BUT ONLY WHEN?
WHEN SUPERMAX COMES OUT WITH THE ""ONCE IN A CENTURY"" EXPLOSIVE AND THUNDERING RESULT THEN BOTH SUPERMAX & KOSSAN WILL RUSH OVER RM10.00!!
FROM JUNE 18TH TO AUGUST 2020 IS LESS THAN 2 MONTHS

When Covid-19 was still known as Novel Coronavirus in end Jan and before a full blown pandemic, during a round of golf, a seasoned investor whom I was having a game with told me to buy Supermax. The price was RM1.70 then. I refused as my biggest reservation was the past political issues of the founder. Clearly, I was wrong
I wanted to be patient to wait for results earnings before I make a call which is my style.I couldn't believe how crazy the sector rerated as retailers, research analysts and promoters were pushing Big 4 and other lesser known / loss making glove players. To me it has become like a ""Tulip Mania"". But I was wrong when Top Glove released the results last week. It was off the charts. They were right.
Now fast forward to today, the entire sector appears to be facing sell off due to a variety of reasons. I won't address it here one by one but will deal with it in a later article. I will only say this - the gloves sector retractment / selloff is a godsend opportunity to those who missed the ride. Whoever entered earlier and is taking profit now, congratulations, you or the fund did well hence taking profit off the table is good discipline.
BUT, this is a good opportunity to collect Topglove, Supermax, Kossan and Hartalega (in order of position) because fundamentally, this will be a record run never seen in our history and it is a culmination of 30-40 years since the industry was built by the pioneers back when there were over 300 players competing. What you see today are the reward being reaped after years of innovation, persistence, competition by these manufacturers who built their business on solid foundation that even China manufacturers with their skilled copycat / technology innovation cannot compete. Malaysia glove sector is an industry that controls 65% of world market share not by sheer luck or opportunistic play. It is years of organic growth backed by natural resources, technology innovation, R&D which has won the trust, certification and global reputation for the country.
This is my view and I hope it will clear some of the confusion / anxiety / worry faced by my fellow investors. Rather than throw your money into syndicated promoted goreng stocks with poor fundamentals, have a little faith in our Malaysian industrialist who have toiled and sweat more than 30 years to play a big role in fighting covid-19 global pandemic and protecting frontliners with their products. Their valuation is more than justified and I believe this is one of the best opportunities in the market right now"

2. Top Glove is the ever expanding, aggressive, high profile number 2 chasing Hartalega market leader (market cap) position. What made me hesitant was the huge debts taken to expand - perpetual sukuk. I never liked overly aggressive business philosophy. However, today Topglove is reaping the full benefit due to their aggressive growth model.
3. Kossan was the number 3, steady, expanding with good margin glove player who was not as aggressive as Topglove but reliable and willing to work hard to fulfil their OEM client needs whilst carving their own niche is technical gloves.
4. Supermax was the OBM player who had fluctuating performance, and margin that was lower with a less healthy balance sheet. Today, Supermax OBM model is paying off benefiting from full ASP increase."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001389.jsp?ftp=69","Jun 20, 2020 5:09 PM","Aramco","In Conclusion, Is the Glove Sector a ""Tulip Mania"" or Is Further Upside Justified?
As for Covid, this began in December 2019 and is still ongoing; no vaccine has been found and approved yet. That said, we have only witness 1 quarter of glove sector earnings performance and it was already mind blowing:
(i) Top Glove tripled;
(ii) Supermax doubled whilst;
(iii) Hartalega unfortunately fell 5%.
Based on our findings, consensus is looking at explosive earnings growth of 2-5x (at peak levels) while the most bullish analyst in town is estimating 3-9x increase. However, share prices only jumped 2-5x unlike during H1N1 where it doubled that of earnings growth; this clearly suggest that glove stocks potentially still have legs to run further. Moreover, valuations look attractive:
1. Top Glove is trading at 18x P/E vs 5-year average of 22x. When we take the EPS of the most bullish analyst, P/E is only 11x.
2. Supermax is trading at 24x P/E vs 5-year average of 14x. At glance appear demanding but if we use the EPS of the most bullish analyst, P/E drops to 16x while for the broker that estimated RM1b profit, P/E is seen to drop to only 9x.
3. Hartalega is trading at 46x P/E vs 5-year average of 32x. Again, it would fall to 28x if we use the EPS of the most bullish analyst.
Thus, we believe the recent selldown presents a good opportunity to consider accumulating; this is in spite of the concerns of windfall tax and massive capacity expansion of peers in China.
1. Historical Valuation and Future Earnings
Firstly, we feel consensus is a little too conservative (2-5x) and should play catch up to the earnings projection of the most bullish analyst (3-9x); this is because the impact of Covid-19 is far more profound than H1N1 but consensus is forecasting only similar earnings growth profile (2-4x). Hence, assuming the windfall tax is to shave some 20% of profit projected by the most bullish analyst, P/E for Top Glove, Supermax & Hartalega is estimated to rise to 14x, 11x & 35x, respectively; when compared against historical average, valuation of Top Glove & Supermax still appear to be inexpensive.
2. The Rising Might of China
As for the massive capacity expansion by Chinese peers, it will take more than the course of 2 years. Building an automated technology driven manufacturing facility is not the same as building a makeshift hospitals in 10 days. Certifications, compliance with FDA, global audit / scrutiny / need for transparency are all prerequisite to become a global supplier of gloves. Additionally, our local glove players will also have similar plans and should be able to defend their market shares. Besides, a prolonged trade war with the US may not bode so well for Chinese players. Europe, US, Australia (G7) have taken a very protective stance against the rise of China resulting in distrust, tariff wars and propaganda attacks. Therefore, all in all, we are not overly disturbed with what they are attempting to achieve.
3. Change in Behavioral Pattern / New Normal
We think after the Covid-19 episode, the awareness of good hygiene has increased and will further support the demand for gloves. Moreover, the % of glove cost to total healthcare expenditure is relatively insignificant. Thus, glove prices may hold better than what most people think after Covid-19.
After considering all of the above, it is too premature to call it game over for the glove sector. Currently, there are only a handful of industries that can depict strong visible earnings growth. Furthermore, there are fears of a 2nd wave of Covid-19. Overall, consensus has a TP of RM20.28 (most bullish analyst: RM25) for Top Glove, RM8.22 (most bullish analyst: RM11) for Supermax & RM11.58 (most bullish analyst: RM17.50) for Hartalega. For us, we would not bet against these Malaysian industrialist who managed to put Malaysia on a global limelight. Of course this is our humble view, now it is your move"

2 new Top Glove call warrants were listed on Friday 19/6/2020.
Topglov C79 and Topglov C80.
(1) Topglov C79
Exercise Price: 26.00
Exercise ratio: 22:1
Maturity date : 26/2/21
Life span : 8 months warrant
Closing price on 19/6/2020 = 0.29
Closing price of mother share = 15.40
Premium = [(0.29x22)+26.00]/15.40 =2.1026 or 110.26%
(2) Topglov C80
Exercise price: 19.88
Exercise ratio: 22:1
Maturity date : 29/1/2021
Life span : 7 months warrant
Closing price on 19/6/2020 = 0.325
Closing price of mother share = 15.40
Premium = [(0.325x22)+19.88]/15.40 = 1.7552 or 75.52%
The issuer of the Call Warrants has manipulated the Bid and Ask prices even on the first day of trading to trap all buyers at very high premiums.
New buyers are attracted by the LOW PRICES of about 0.30 range instead of the many old warrants trading at a dollar or more. In actual fact all these low priced warrants are very much more riskier at ridiculously high premiums.
Lets compare with an older call warrant Topglov C74,
(3) Topglov C74
Exercise price: 8.00
Exercise ratio: 7:1
Maturity date : 22/3/2021
Life span : 9 months
Closing price on 19/6/2020 = 1.20
Closing price of mother share = 15.40
Premium = [(1.20x7)+8]/15.40 =1.0649 or 6.49%
In summary, Topglov C79 Topglov C80 Topglov C74
Life span 8 months 7 months 9 months
Premium 110.26% 75.52% 6.49%
Very simple analysis, C74 has a longer life span and yet is only trading at a low premium of 6.49%. Big big difference.
Last reminder, try to avoid NEW Call Warrants at the present moment. IB is trapping new buyers.
I do keep some C74 but my major investment is in the mother shares."

Kossan share price will up, is true, i no say that Kossan no good, is good. But the company growth too slow. Example topglove: from 4.21 to 18, you can calculate the gap of profit how much can earn? For topglove now result share prices fair value at least need stand above RM 20, eps 13.5 director give 10 cents big dividend. Topglove have 50% dividend policy, now eps 13.5 give you 10 cents dividend, you think director dont know how to calculate? Is it a signal for September result will be very good? Kossan from 3.92 to 9, you can calculate how the gap of profit compare to Topglove, Supermax and Harta? Yes, Kossan maybe will go until RM11 if you hold it for long time, but you need calculate the gap of profit you can earn. If you want maximize your profit, switch your money to Topglove, Harta and Supermax, because the result will growth faster than Kossan. If you is uncle aunty style, than you can hold it. You can see Kossan daily trade volume is very very small compare to other glove company. This also because director of Kossan too conservative and always delay. For as investors the things we need to do is maximize our profit right? Facts you must accept, fight win me you cant earn any money and financial freedom.

Glove stocks market moved lower early on June 2 and June 3. We could see this is a ""washout low"" price rotation following a technical pattern that will prompt a much higher rally in glove market. This type of washout pricing rotation is fairly common before very big moves after bullish pennant/flag formation or just after reaching major price trigger levels. Also, we believe fund managers have taken this as good opportunities consider hedging their portfolio positioning in glove markets at this time.
With gloves, almost a month sideways pennant/flag formation has been setting up near Pitchfork's indicator that use three parallel trendlines in identify possible levels of support and resistance as well as potential breakout and breakdown levels. We believe this washout rotation is a process of running through the Long Stops just below recent price activity that will end with a defined upside price rally over the next 2-5 days period.
My Bets: Get ready. this should be a really nice upside price swing in glove over the next 6 months or longer. Pay attention to any breakout on BM healthcare index - the clear leader which I posted in the last review that to rally higher by about 15 - 30% - setting up new price highs for all glove makers!

1. Latest quarter only reported jan to march 31st quarter
The months of april, may and june will be superb
2. Many oversold kossan to buy supermax and topglove (Calvin bought both supermax and topglove)
3. Uncle koon pushed supermax and comfort.
So kossan being less popular is neglected
4. Now rubberex has sprung a big surprise profit. Kossan will also spring a Big surprise likewise
5. The net assets of Kossan is far more substantial than both comfort and supermax
6. So that is why Calvin thinks Kossan a great value buy now
7. Kossan going above Rm10. 00 is a given
Only thing is
Will kossan go as high as Rm15 or Rm18?"

Why most people will switch to Topglove, Harta and Supermax? Because the Selling Price. Kossan and comfort director is very conservative, they already told you do business is for long terms. I suggest you go see the Bloomberg interview video, repeat listen. And compare Kossan and other glove company, is it Kossan doing 24 hours shift to produce glove? Answer is No, but other is Yes. Share price will increase is depend the result, share price up how much is 100% depend of the result improve how much. I dont think Kossan will go until RM15, if Kossan RM15 then supermax should stand at RM20? Dont waste your time fall in love at conservative company, switch to company that can maximize your profit, dont waste your golden time during covid-19. If you lose the time, you cant earn back. Kossan is no cheaper and i can say is very expensive compare to Harta, Topglove and Supermax, because Kossan result cant support at RM 8 this price. Kossan net profit is lowest than Supermax,
Kossan can stand at RM 8 is because the glove trend. You say Kossan is cheaper? No, is very expensive. Why market dont want Kossan? Because the growth is too slow. Why i say Harta, Topglove and Supermax is very cheaper? After you see August and September results you will know. No need fight with me, accept the facts."

This is only the example, as investor we need maximize our profits, clever choose the company to invest. Why wanna choose Kossan? The profit gap you can earn is very less. Now most expensive company is Kossan, why you want buy expensive company? Another example, if you have two leg, you will run faster than those people only have one leg right?

KOSSAN IS THE ONLY TOP GLOVE STOCK HELD VERY VERY TIGHTLY BY TOP MALAYSIAN & WORLD FUNDS AT OVER 70%
EASTSPRING INVESTMENT FUND ALSO IN TOP 30 OF KOSSAN
SO FREEFLOAT ONLY LESS THAN 30%
IF GOT GOOD NEWS LIKE RUBBEREX CAN VERY EASILY SEE KOSSAN GO ""LIMIT UP!!
YESSSS!!!!
GUO SHAN GOES OVER THE MOUNTAIN AND ""LIMIT UP!!!""
STOP PRESS!!!
KOSSAN HAS SOLID ASSET BASE LIKE TOP GLOVE
SO JUST LIKE RUBBEREX SPRUNG SURPRISE EARNINGS KOSSAN CAN ALSO SPRING A BIG SURPRISE
THEN LIMIT UP!!! AND GO OVER RM12.00!!
HOHOHO!!!"

Volume low is market less people interest invest it. You should check what logic happen. Why market no dare invest it? Is it company faudamental problem? Director too conservative? Selling price less? All the point you need to think. Not only think about director hold 50% share like tat. The important is company have any strong story? Have any strong point let market buy it?

It is just the media and politicians wanting to calm the market but they are completely clueless. Fauci also suggested that due to FDA requirement, the first shot of trial will be push to beginning of next year and then it may take another one year or so to see the efficacy or drop in antibody in the human subjects across that period. Even Oxford is suggesting the efficacy of the vaccine (if proven successful) may only last a year or so thus re-vaccination may be required every year and if that is the case the glove demand and exponential growth will b here to stay. One thing for sure is that the order book for the big 4 go as far as end of 2021. Also, the pharma companies cannot produce that much of vaccine in a year, then the question is whether we are going to have a lasting solution of that we just have to live with it."

Despite this it doesn’t means that we’re not interested in other glove counters, it is however we had manage to receive more information on the above 2 companies compared to others as such we are more keen in going with what we CONFIRMED than speculations as we can see from other smaller players which reported a somewhat under expected results.
We’re quite sure the ASP of the above 2 companies is now already at least 100% or more since April 2020, and are still in the rise especially since their orders have been confirmed till year 2021.
Vaccine is still the major concern for the gloves industry as it may spell an end to the COVID-19 pandemic however medical experts have already informed that the earliest possibility of vaccine will be by next year.
Given this I strongly believe the trend of glove movement is still intact given the recent corrections in the chart and especially when all big 4 gloves companies have now entered into their newest high prices as per our prediction forming a new higher high for the uptrend patterns.

With gloves, today bursa healthcare indices made its historic high at 2,801 from low of 2,158 on 19/6/2020 after almost 30% hikes among the sectors. It has also hit the first target of important fibonacci extension target 2,790 (161,8%) in impulsive trend before pulling back closed today with a bullish hammer stick. For that reason maybe some strong hands unloading just ahead of getting into the historic highs resistance area.
Would this bull rally continue higher?
My Bets: We have divergence on hourlies. No rush is needed without a breakout of today strong resistance high because bears can easily claim this is a topping formation. Otherwise, we are looking for one more move to the upside, probably higher 3,205 (261,8%) area.

Rational exuberance
Backing out the implied long-term growth using GGM
Record profits for 2020 are now a given, but it is not known whether this is sustainable or for how long. Our analysis after triangulating various industry data points suggests glove demand will stay strong through 2021 and potentially even until 2022 on restocking activities. We see ample upside for glove manufacturers despite the run-up, with our target prices derived using modest target P/E implying long-term growth of 5% (based on GGM), against normalised industry growth of 8-10% p.a. Maintain sector Overweight with Top Glove our top pick and Kossan Rubber upgraded from Outperform to BUY.
Global supply shortage forecasted throughout the next three years
q Concerns about competition from Chinese players have led us to map out global demand and supply dynamics via the triangulation of industry data from various sources.
q We project glove demand to grow at 25%/15%/10% in 2020/21/22, versus the historical run-rate of 8-9% p.a.
q Against the forecasted global supply by various players, which would yet see some downside from delays/cancellation (especially from overly aggressive Chinese players), we foresee a glove supply shortage continuing throughout the next three years.
Higher base ASPs sustainable so long as spot demand persists
q Recent share price rerating is driven predominantly by expectations of sector earnings surge, with the market extending expectations for earnings to now peak by 1H2021.
q In our view, base ASPs will remain at current elevated levels so long as spot orders are
sustained. We believe spot demand will only start contracting when demand supply
imbalances normalise, a scenario we believe will not materialise until post-2022.
q Even then, the industry would have gone through a significant drawdown in inventory, which necessitates end users and distributors to rebuild buffer inventories for another year. We expect this coupled with significantly higher cost of operations in the new norm
to sustain a c.20% higher run-rate ASPs vis-à-vis pre-Covid-19 levels.
CLSA street high earnings estimates across the three glove makers
q The fact that the Malaysian glove makers will report bumper profit in CY20 should no longer come as a surprise to the market, but the question is: for how long?
q Top Glove – We believe Top Glove could report c.RM1.2bn net profit in 4QFY20 (4x higher QoQ) underpinning our FY20 (Aug) earnings raise by 37%. Such strong profits is expected to extend to FY21/22 where its higher spot mix is supportive of our 187% YoY earnings growth in FY21 to RM5.2bn. Current share price implies valuations of 10x FY21 and an undemanding 34x (below +1.5s.d) based on normalised FY22 earnings.
q Hartalega – Relatively late to the game of price hikes, the significant demand has put upward pressure on ASPs. We raise our FY21 (Mar)/22/23 net profit by 10%/50%/31%. It is now apparent that Hartalega will see similar upsurge in ASPs, albeit with a slight lag.
q Kossan – Visibility on ASP is limited, but we are also raising our FY20/21 net profit by 53%/109% as our previous assumptions were overtly conservative relative to peers.
Historical P/E trend irrelevant against sector peak earnings
q The sector peak earnings, whilst a positive, poses a significant challenge for PE-based valuation, as the historical P/E trend is no longer meaningful.
q Intuitively, the target P/E multiple should reflect the fact that the 2021/22 earnings is elevated and could potentially normalise after. This begs the question as to whether it is fair to use historical P/E trend to value the stock on earnings that is not sustainable.
q In valuing the stocks, we have therefore applied a significantly lower target P/E depending on how elevated the forecasted earnings is to the cycle-adjusted earnings.
q Our target P/E for Top Glove/Hartalega/Kossan at 15x/35x/19x implies LT growth of c.5% p.a., which we believe is reasonable versus industry trend of 8-10% p.a., and the fact that these players are dominant in its field.
q We lift our TPs across the board: from RM22.00 to RM28.00 for Top Glove; from RM16.30 to RM20.00 for Hartalega; and from RM9.80 to RM13.00 for Kossan. While we reiterate our BUY ratings for Top Glove and Hartalega, we upgrade Kossan Rubber from Outperform to BUY on our earnings upgrade and significant discount in valuations.

Is it the obm and selling price? As a smart investor you should learn how to maximize your profit. For example, Supermax from 1.28 to 10.68, how much profit gap you will earn? Kossan from 4 to 10.92 how much profit gap you earn? Share price can go how far is purely depend of result improve how much? You already know the key point of result improve is selling price, than why you dont want be a smart investor switch your money to high selling price glove company?

After August quarter result announced if net profit lowest than Supermax you will see the share price drop like hell, because no good enough result support. Why Kossan keep selling the price until now? Why Kossan cant like Topglove, Harta and Supermax director keep buying their share giving investors confidence?

“ The report also suggests health-care workers will need to keep reusing N95 masks for months to come. And it notes there remain no domestic manufacturers of nitrile gloves, meaning hospitals must continue relying on foreign suppliers.”
https://www.google.com.my/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/07/...
And also this for a quick read to give You more confidence. From star explaining that supermax market capitalisation is as much as Hartalega. Also shows in the article that Kossan is not lagging behind and will catch up to supermax. Watch oi my guys. And for supermax PE 20 is TP13.5 and PE 40 is at TP 18. (Source KYY). With the market capitalisation of supermax that’s so close to harta, TP18 is very much achievable! In my constant monitoring I realise that supermax and kossan is always neck to neck and follow each other. I foresee kossan flying tomorrow. TP is at 14 anyway.

MARKETS
Friday, 10 Jul 2020
By INTAN FARHANA ZAINUL
FBM KLCI CHT
PETALING JAYA: The stock market, powered by the rise in rubber glove stocks which makes a number of them more valuable than a number of household corporate names, almost pared back all of its losses for this year as it remains supported by cheap borrowing costs and an improving economic outlook.
Glove stocks continued to rally including Supermax Corp Bhd which hit an all-time high of RM12.44 per share, giving it a market capitalisation of RM16.1bil.
Supermax is now more valuable than Genting Bhd, Telekom Malaysia Bhd or Sime Darby Bhd which have market capitalisation of RM15.86bil, RM15.67bil and RM14.41bil, respectively.
Top Glove Bhd’s market capitalisation was at RM57.1bil and Hartalega Holdings Bhd at RM56.2bil.
The stocks are the fourth and fifth largest companies on Bursa Malaysia based on market capitalisation."

Basically thank you all who listened to the bad comments and panic sell. I just topped up a lot at 10.320 haha! Stop reading online and believing people who simply post.

Management mentioned that this will help Kossan to achieve synergy effect and able to set up the lines faster and with lower cost. Management target to setup 16 lines in the stated industrial property that can produced a total of 5bil gloves. This will be setup in stages with early stage 6 lines and later on another 10 lines. Working out the figure, Kossan is trying to produce the additional 1.875bil of gloves through the 6 lines asap to capitalize on current market condition. Not to forget Bidor expansion plan is ongoing as per planned.
-Kossan management is in the view that demand for gloves is not coming down soon, at least for the mid term (1-2 years). They also mentioned that they will raised asp for 20-30% in 2H 2020 as they would also have to ensure the long term partnership with their existing customer as they emphasize on sustainability in the long run.

Guo Shan!!!
Yes!! Our Netx target price of Rm14.00 shall now be in sight as we move nearer to August 2020 result !!!
Price to asset Kossan is the least expensive
OEM though slower than others it will be very steady as Glove Buyers of Kossan know Kossan Management can be trusted in time of need.
Kossan clean room PPE command higher value than exam gloves. Kossan also got clean room face masks. So even without heavy Obm booster Kossan will still do very well
The collective run up of all 4 Bull stocks side by side are still in full blast
So hold tight and if got weakness it will be an opportunity to add more

The IPO priced at 34 TB & the current price as at 10th July 20 is 74.50TB, a very impressive increase of 119% since the IPO within 1 week's time. Ringgit 2b fund has been raised (30% of the total company shares).
This prices the company at 14.5b in ringgit currently. For simple comparison, Kossan price after the rally last week is priced at 15.8b.
Below is the simple comparison between STGT and Kossan on other aspects:
a) annual production capacity (year 2019): 27b (STGT) vs 32b (Kossan)
b) % of nitrile glove: 35% (STGT) vs 80% (Kossan)
c) Revenue 1Q20: 3,761m TB, or 512m MYR equivalent vs 611m (Kossan)
d) 1Q20 profit: 421.89m TB, or 57.5m MYR equivalent vs 82.5m (Kossan)
In short, there is still huge investment demand in glove stocks globally. The glove stocks in Malaysia are fairly price with global peers.

In terms of forward valuation, it is the cheapest now. 1 year forward projected earnings growth is quite similar to Supermax based on consensus view, but earnings multiple is half of Supermax though i do note that Supermax is anticipated to record higher growth in the second year. So in terms of 2 year forward, Supermax is on par with Kossan. But the disparity can be seen in terms of P/BV, Kossan is much cheaper vis-a-vis ROE in comparison to Supermax.
If the consensus is right, i believe Kossan has more upside potential at current valuation."

Currently there are 12,400,000 confirmed Covid 19 cases and 559,000 deaths in the world. The chart below shows there are more than 200,000 new cases daily.
The Chart below shows that there are 3,097,300 confirmed Covid 19 cases and 132,683 deaths in the USA. The chart below shows that in the US the daily cases started in March and currently there are about 60,000 new cases daily. The US has the largest number of Covid 19 cases in the world.
China and many other countries are testing vaccine on humans. It will take a long time for FDA to approve the use of the vaccine and to vaccinate millions of people.
Due to Covid 19 pandemic, the demand for medical gloves far exceeds supply. As a result, glove price continues to increase higher and higher. All glove manufacturers are taking advantage of the situation to increase their selling price.
After I read the analyst briefing from Supermax on 5 July I need to update my target price based on page 13 as shown below.
I refer to the above report, total issued number of shares is 1,360 million.
The 3rd quarter ending 31 March 2020, revenue/sale Rm 447 million, PBT Rm 95 million and PAT Rm 71 million. The production cost is revenue Rm 447 million minus PBT Rm 95 million = Rm 352 million and average selling price (ASP) is US$ 60.
As shown on Supermax’ briefing page 13 above, ASP for the 4th quarter ending June 2020, the selling price was increased from US$60 to US$ 160, an increase of US$100 which is pure profit because the additional selling price does not involve production cost.
The 4th quarter ending June 2020, the production cost Rm 352 million divided by 60 X 160 = Rm 939 million which is the revenue/sale minus Rm 352 production cost = Rm 587 million which is pure PBT or PAT Rm 410 million.
I refer to the table above. The total PAT for 1st quarter Rm 24,747 million, 2nd quarter Rm 30,165 million and 3th quarter Rm 71,065 million. As I calculated, the 4th quarter PAT is Rm 410 million.
The total profit before tax (PAT) for the year ending June 2020 is Rm 536 million.
EPS Rm 536 million divided by total issued share 1,360 million = 40 sen."

i have sold my positions
remember the no.1 rule, don't lose money, unrealised gains can be evaporated in an instant
trade carefully
Fabien ""The Efficient Capital Allocater"" Irregardless, i view Kossan as a laggard play.
In terms of forward valuation, it is the cheapest now. 1 year forward projected earnings growth is quite similar to Supermax based on consensus view, but earnings multiple is half of Supermax though i do note that Supermax is anticipated to record higher growth in the second year. So in terms of 2 year forward, Supermax is on par with Kossan. But the disparity can be seen in terms of P/BV, Kossan is much cheaper vis-a-vis ROE in comparison to Supermax.
If the consensus is right, i believe Kossan has more upside potential at current valuation.

I'm now talking about Kossan and Supermax gap should be near in rm 1-2 gap.So which own more return.The profit margin of Kossan should be higher and or the same.So why the gap so large.TP rm 18-rm 21(Best case snenario).Anything more should be a bonus.The coming financial result should know I'm telling the truth.

We have gone through this before with Top Glove.Have a look to what happened with Topglove on the 3rd of June. The drop difference is same as what happened today and the recovery. It's a normal thing people collecting profit. As fast as it dropped, it recovered. Banks have increased their TP. You really think its going to drop? I just topped up at the bottom. So i'm a happy man today and still holding. Managed to average down a lot today thanks to panic sellers. I give you the benefit of the doubt. I have experienced this a few times before."

Everyone know topglove and supermax will benefit most due to covid19 because they got extra capacity...but their share price also up a lot
For harta...based on analyst report you sure harta profit increase better than kossan? haha

On the 4-hour chart, we have five visible waves within a strong wave impulsive uptrend since end of June, low at 2,158. We think that is an extended wave three, meaning that more upside will come after fourth wave retracement. Indexes started turning down from the latest 3,347 high yesterday and quickly rebound sharply from low of 3,000 before closing at 3,177. As such, there could be a minor wave-4 completion and final wave-5 underway to continue and hit higher, before a major correction take control.
My Bets: One more push higher possible to test record high at 3,537 (Fib ratio of 161.8 of recent pullbacks)
Let us do a quick calculation on how much prices could the gloves makers to run and test if the high 3,537 achieved based on index weights:
TopGlove RM 25,00 (26,8% hike from 20,50 low)
Harta RM 20,00 (32,8% hike from 15,20 low)
Supermx RM17,50 (40% hike from 12,52 low)
Kossan RM 15,50 ((33% hike from 12,00 low)

Finally someone is speaking the hard-to-swallow truth. Just like property boom back then, every developers worked together with gurus to sell overvalued properties based on the 'FUTURE' price. Sadly, they are still doing that now. Hope that people will finally come to senses and value a stock/property based on the dividends/rentals and dividends/rentals growth. Instead of hoping to buy high and sell higher.
But of course, buy high and sell higher is a much quicker way to create wealth. And thankfully, it still works for now!! So keep trading guys (but please use stop loss)!

In an interview with the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), Dr. Fuch said that if the new coronavirus is similar to other coronaviruses, the vaccine developed in the end may not provide a long immunization time.
Dr. Fauci said: ""When you look back at the history of coronaviruses, the common coronaviruses that cause the common cold"", ""the persistence of the protective immune system usually does not exceed 1 year, generally ranging from 3-6 months"", ""This is not a very long protection.""
When asked if scientists could find an effective vaccine, Dr. Fauci said he was ""cautiously optimistic"". It said there is nothing to ensure that scientists can develop effective vaccines, and it may take ""months and years"" to really get an answer."

A significant decline in trading will crash all the glove counters because of the sketchy fundamentals. Imagine everyone dumps together to cut loss but no one wants to buy until the price to value equilibrium is achieved.
Anyway, it will still go up and down repeatedly for now! Just buy high but sell higher to the next greedy newbies! Keep trading guys!!

KUALA LUMPUR (July 15): Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd (HLIB) raised its earnings forecast and share target prices (TPs) for rubber glove manufacturers Top Glove Corp Bhd, Hartalega Holdings Bhd and Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd on expectation of higher average selling prices (ASPs) for gloves due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
In a note today, HLIB analyst Farah Diyana Kamaludin said the research firm maintained its ""overweight"" call on the rubber glove sector with ""buy"" calls for Top Glove, Hartalega and Kossan, shares.
""Maintain 'overweight' on rubber gloves driven by a pandemic-fuelled demand. Market leader Top Glove (TP: RM31.31) is our top pick for the sector, being the largest glove manufacturer globally with vast clientele, readily supporting the increasing demand,"" she said."

The resurgence of the virus in Tokyo could add to the growing pressure on policymakers to shore up the world’s No 3 economy, which analysts say is set to shrink at its fastest pace in decades this fiscal year due to the pandemic. Tokyo’s daily virus cases exceeded 200 in four of the past seven days, touching a record of 243 last Friday as testing among nightclub workers in its red-light districts showed rising infections among people in their 20s and 30s. Infections are rising in other parts of Japan too, with Osaka prefecture in the west reporting 61 new cases today, its highest daily figure since April 20. — Reuters"

Dont put 100% faith in vaccines to fight the pandemic. It is an RNA virus, it keeps mutating slightly all the time. Antigenic drift. Like the common flu virus.Vaccines may help. but physical measures are still of paramount importance..

When will a coronavirus vaccine be available?
The U.S. government aims to get a vaccine to the public by January with its program called Operation Warp Speed. As part of Operation Warp Speed, the Department of Health and Human Services offered as much as $483 million in support to Moderna, $1.2 billion to AstraZeneca, and $456 million to Johnson & Johnson.
Moderna says it's on target to deliver about 500 million doses per year, and possibly as many as 1 billion, by next year. Oxford researchers, referring to the AstraZeneca vaccine, said they'd have efficacy results from their phase 3 trial this fall in ""the best-case scenario.""
For all companies investigating vaccines, trial results will determine the final timeline. If all goes well, it's possible one or more companies may meet the government's goal. However, any headwinds could slow the process."

But the latest forecast from the university’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), released late on Tuesday, also predicts the death toll could be reduced by 40,000 if nearly all Americans wore masks in public. The IHME’s new forecast came after Alabama, Florida and North Carolina on Tuesday reported record daily increases in deaths from COVID-19, marking grim new milestones of a second wave of infections surging across much of the U.S. At least 136,052 Americans have died from COVID-19, while reported US infections have surpassed 3.4 million, according to a tally by Reuters. — Reuters"

Look, I didn't comment anything during the morning trading hours today, and the gloves in general are still red. We both know that IF the fundamentals are intact, my comments will have no impact on the prices. Trade at your own risk, and stop blaming others when you lose money. When you decided to enter at such a high valuation (when the risks outsize the rewards), you should have prepared yourself mentally well to lose it until the price to value equilibrium is reached. Grow up and stop being a man-sized baby. If you can't afford to stomach the paper loss, stick with FD or cash equivalents investment securities."

By FocusM | 43 minutes ago | Mainstream
BURSA Malaysia has forbidden any direct business transactions (DBT) involving Top Glove Corp Bhd until 4.30pm.
Citing the Bursa Trading Rule 10.10 (1), the regulator said Top Glove stocks would only be authorised for DBT at 4.30pm.
Dealers and remisiers had been reminded that the reference price for DBT upon authorisation would be the volume weighted average price from 3.30pm to 4.30pm for trade stocks and reference price for untraded stocks.
Aside from that, normal market trading has not been affected, Bursa Malaysia said.
Top Glove earlier confirmed that its wholly owned subsidiaries, Top Glove Sdn Bhd and TG Medical Sdn Bhd, had been served detention orders by the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
The group’s shares were suspended earlier but resumed trading at 3.30pm with its last done price at the time of writing being RM19.70.
Issued on July 15, the order is on disposable gloves manufactured by Top Glove and TG Medical.
“We are reaching out to the CBP through our office in the US to understand the issue better and work towards a speedy resolution of the matter, within an estimated two weeks,” said Top Glove, the world’s largest glove maker.
The group noted that there was a possibility the order may be related to foreign labour issues, which the company had already resolved, except for one more issue regarding retrospective payment of recruitment fees by staff to agents prior to 2019 without the company’s knowledge.
“However, Top Glove has already been bearing all recruitment fees since January 2019 when our Zero Recruitment Fee Policy was implemented,” clarified the company.
Top Glove said it has been working over the past few months on this issue, which involves extensive tracing, to establish the correct amount to be paid back to its workers on behalf of the previous agents.
“We estimate the total amount to be about RM20 mil to RM50 mil. We believe it is in the best interests of all parties to come to a solution expeditiously so that our disposable gloves can reach the parties that need it the most during this time of Covid-19,” the company said, promising updates as the situation develops. – July 16, 2020"

KUALA LUMPUR (July 16): Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd’s main shareholder Tan Sri Lim Kuang Sia and his family have been selling Kossan shares as the stock's price climbed further.
According to the group’s filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Lim’s privately-held vehicle, Kossan Holdings (M) Sdn Bhd, sold five million Kossan shares on July 13 and another 17 million shares on July 14, for a total of 22 million shares or a 1.7% stake in the group.
Meanwhile, on July 14, Lim’s spouse Puan Sri Chow Cheng Moey sold 500,000 Kossan shares held in her own name.
Coincidently, Kossan’s share hit an all-time high on July 14, closing at RM13.50, after rising to an intra-day high of RM14.94.
On April 17, Lim had disposed of a total of 20.65 million shares or a 1.6% stake in Kossan on the open market, done through Kossan Holdings (M) Sdn Bhd. At that time, Kossan shares was trading at RM5.55.
From the run-up in Kossan’s share price, which had jumped more than two times from the end of last year, Lim has seen his personal wealth jump by RM4.86 billion to RM7.51 billion, from RM2.65 billion previously."

Yesterday, Top Glove was among the top decliners on the local exchange. It was last traded at RM21.24, down RM1 or 2.57%, after the counter was suspended at 2.30pm yesterday. Trading in Top Glove’s shares was supposed to resume at 3.30pm but, coincidentally, trading across Bursa Malaysia was halted around the same time due to “technical issues”.

Yes, Kossan has low PE compare to others. But even i accounted the 2H 2020 20% - 30% increase in ASP. its still not worth (If compare to supermax and TG).
Harta with ASP as per report 42-45usd/1000pcs also is not worth the price.

BURSA Malaysia is not a market for retailers. Some 30% of the index weighting is on glove stocks – namely Top Glove Corp Bhdand Hartalega Holdings Bhd.
On a single day, the price of the four glove stocks can gyrate anywhere between 20% and 30% and it is accompanied by huge volumes, which suggests that it is a playing ground for the funds as well as punters.
In a single day last week, Supermax Corp Bhd, which is among the top four glove companies, gyrated as much as RM5.30. It went as high as RM17.80 and as low as RM12.50, before closing the day at RM15.90.
A normal investor would probably have had a heart seizure. Anybody who had bought the stock at the peak with the view of selling on the same day would have lost his or her pants.
The story is the same for all the other glove stocks. The price gyration is scary, to say the least. The stocks are up in the morning before coming down late afternoon and picking up strongly by the end of the trading day.
Clearly, it is not the kind of market for retailers. It’s only for those who are really experienced in trading and understand the dynamics of jumping in and out without getting hurt.
Some research houses have tagged unprecedented valuations on glove stocks. It’s surprising that even the foreign houses have raised the price of the top-notch glove companies such as Top Glove and Hartalega to more than RM30. Credit Suisse’s target for Top Glove is RM37.
Glove stocks are trading at historical price earnings (PE) multiple of between 75 time and 170 times at current prices. Among the four glove manufacturers, the stock with the highest PE multiple is Supermax while Kossan Rubber Industries Bhdis at the lowest end at 75 times PE.
If the stocks hit the price targets as set out by the research houses, we are looking at Supermax possibly trading at almost 200 times PE and Top Glove at more than 120 times PE. The mind-boggling valuations are jaw-dropping but analysts seem to suggest that the stocks have the earnings potential.
Are analyst reports reliable?
The upgrade in price targets by research houses suggests that there is an impending earnings explosion of the companies in the second quarter. But what the research houses fail to stress is the sustainability of the earnings.
To the pessimist on glove stocks, they would say that analyst reports certainly are not a yardstick as they are just forecast numbers and not any indication to buy or sell the stock.
However, to be fair, some research houses had predicted Top Glove to be RM25 a month ago when it was barely touching RM15. Then, many had dismissed the price target as nonsensical. Now, RM25 seems to be a reasonable price for Top Glove for some.
Amidst the optimism surrounding glove stocks, it’s interesting to note that the major shareholders of Kossan have disposed of a little of their holdings in the market. The family of Tan Sri Lim Kuang Sia, who control Kossan and are known for not selling their shares even when prices were high, sold a few million shares in recent weeks.
The family still retains a substantial 47% in Kossan. Their move to take some money off the table is something that should not be dismissed. It’s a clear signal that glove stocks are looking over-valued.
The interest on glove stocks is so huge that it is said to be responsible for the crash of Bursa Malaysia’s trading system on Thursday. The crash came as there was heavy selling on glove stocks following news that the US authorities have stopped some shipments of Top Glove’s exports to that country.
The US market accounts for 25% of Top Glove’s exports and gives the highest average selling prices for the gloves. Hence, the impact is significant on Top Glove.
The announcement was out during the lunch break although news of the consignment being stopped seeped into the market in the morning. Top Glove resumed trading at 3.30pm. Shortly later, the system crashed.
Brokers feel that the crash came about because of the heavy sell order for glove stocks, which is not surprising considering the volume these stocks garner.
The run on the glove stocks is a reminder of the dotcom run in 1999 when semiconductor producers namely Malaysian Pacific IndustriesBhd and Unisem Bhd were the darlings of the stock market.
The stocks were on an uptrend for almost a year before the dotcom crash in 2000. The two stocks hit ballistic valuations that not many fund managers had envisaged. Until today, the two stocks are still considered the bell-weather for the tech sector.
But now there are many more players in the tech sector. They are diversified into several segments within the sector and Technology is an index within Bursa itself.
Similarly, the play on glove companies is now focused on the top four stocks. The others are enjoying the run on the sector. If demand for gloves continues, the sector will likely see more new names emerging on the stock market."

It’s better to put money in the new names instead of the current basket of companies on Bursa Malaysia where valuations and trading volumes are dangerous for retail investors."

On the other hand ,what implications to u if the family are buying back the shares? Well,it could imply that the shares not marketable and they are buying in support or it could send another signal to the market that they are confident in the growth.
So you see,you guys should look at the bright side of it and at a wider perspective.think about it.would the directors be so stupid to cash in at the wrong time to jeopardise the value of the remaining shareholding?

Local institution collects all and reset the game and push until TP RM37.
The Naysayers are using “Bubbles” effectively to push the price down and generate massive sell off. What everyone should do, all of the time, is to protect capital and unrealized profits ROI consistently. This is done using stop losses at fundamental support levels, or technical support levels. These levels are visible on all stock charts.
If you do this, then you do not need to worry. If the market crashes again, then you should be taken out of your positions automatically and have most of the unrealized profits intact. I realize that there are many people who do not believe in this. Everyone who has done so was very relieved when they found themselves out of the market during a major collapse.
There are two primary months of the year when the stock market, historically, has had a major crash. Although crashes can happen any month at any time, the fact that these two months have had the most and worst collapses in 130 years of data, is something to consider. October is number one, and March is number two. Yes, there have been times when the market crashed in other months. One fascinating fact is that the market has never crashed between June and August. What I surmise by this empirical evidence is that during these periods, usually, the retail investors are not as focused on the stock market.
Right now, there are two factors to watch: an extraordinary activity with the retail investors and retail traders eager to buy speculatively, stocks that are extremely expensive with price far above the current known fundamentals. Also, there is a major undercurrent of legal manipulation going on which is the catalyst for this speculative buying. This is called a Bubble.
Bubbles can endure for a long time, occasionally a year or so but all bubbles have 3 things in common:
Prices of stocks are so far above the true fundamental value that when the bubble bursts the stock collapses spectacularly back down and into fundamental price levels. The collapse has no warning, it just happens with a retail panic catalyst. Those who speculated are furiously angry with the stock market, blaming the market as “corrupt” “evil” etc and vowing never to buy stocks again. These speculators tend to lose more than their original capital as they are over leveraged financially.
Bubbles never last. They always end in with an amazing implosion. Before the bubble implodes, there is chronic rhetoric claiming the prices will go up forever and that there will not be a market crash. Keep this in mind, then you will always be ready for any market situation. There is no need to panic and sell, just use trailing profit stops.
All the best to this afternoon trading..
Meow."

Spot price of glove peaked at USD160 since mid April and stagnant till now. Supermax has enjoyed this price for most of its Q2 revenue due to its unique OBM model. its Q2 profit will be fantastic, as reflected in its current share price & today's bonus issued. To up another 100% profit in Q3, it needs to sell its glove at USD320. Is it possible?
The key drivers of profit is ASP, where supermx has already reaped the max in its Q2 result. In contrast, there are still plenty of potential upside in ASP for OEM players like TopGlov & Kossan. They has so far increased 5% in ASP (<USD30) (to be reflected in Kossan Q2 result). Based on Supermx analyst slides, its manufacturing price has increased to USD90, which indicates potential profit of 1000% to both TopGlov & Kossan, perhaps happened by this year end."

Retail investors, known locally as ants, were a force in a 50% stock-price surge after a virus-induced sell-off in March.
SEOUL: Day traders seeking help for gambling addiction have tripled in number in South Korea, as COVID-19 social distancing and working-from-home has freed up more time for online stock market trading, data showed.
Retail investors, known locally as ants, were a force in a 50% stock-price surge after a virus-induced sell-off in March.
From then through May, however, those seeking help for trading-related addictive behaviour reached 214, showed data from the Korea Center on Gambling Problems. The growth rate eclipsed the overall 16% rise in calls seeking help.
The trend is a worrying sign of things to come should social distancing practices such as work-from-home become the norm, experts said, as isolated individuals have even fewer mechanisms such as peer support to check addictive behaviour.
Compulsive stock trading also lacks the social stigma that may act as a deterrent toward traditional forms of gambling, even though the stimulation behind both is similar, they said.
South Korea has not enforced any virus-busting lockdown measures, even during the height of the outbreak in the country over February and March. Nevertheless, people and businesses by and large have followed government guidelines and refrained from social gatherings and instituted work-from-home arrangements.
One such individual was 35-year-old bank employee surnamed Lee. He has been trading shares online for over a year since hearing of a friend who made a windfall through frequently buying and selling stocks based on rumour and speculation.
Though Lee has seen some success - once making a profit of several hundred thousand dollars in a single trade - increased trading time afforded by working-from-home culminated last month in him losing 1.2 billion won ($1 million) over five days.
On the insistence of his wife, he said, he subsequently sought help from a gambling addiction counsellor.
""We tend to see an influx of people seeking help after a huge market dive,"" said Kim Yeon-su, treatment manager at the Korea Center on Gambling Problems help centre in Seoul. ""It happened with Bitcoin and now it's happening with stocks.""
Active trading accounts - the bulk of which belong to retail investors - rose 2.8 million from mid-January through mid-July, versus 1.6 million in the same period last year, financial association data showed.
The surge was reflected in the July listing of SK Biopharmaceuticals Co Ltd, where each share on offer for retail investors attracted 323 prospective buyers whose down-payments totalled 31 trillion won. The successful buyers saw their investment more than quintuple in four days.
Investor message boards on South Korea's dominant internet search portal see high traffic throughout trading hours with posts such as,""I want to become a king ant"" and ""I was robbed today as usual"", plus discussion of obscure stocks and preferred shares.
Mental health experts said trading can become high-stakes gambling, with little to hold back the trader when they can trade easily online at home and often on credit.
""Some of these people are buying, selling, buying, selling... To become a gambler, you need immediate stimulation to the brain. Invest in stable things, wait three months - they don't do this,"" said psychiatrist Shin Young-chul at the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital.
""For a person for whom 400 million won goes back and forth in a day, can they stay engaged in their job that earns 2 million won a month?"" - Reuters"

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001389.jsp?ftp=101","Jul 22, 2020 1:22 AM","Apple1234","***Share others article:
When I said rm 8....ok....when I said rm 10 OK..... When I said rm 15 OK.... Still dint join.... When I said rm 20 OK... Too high la... When I said rm 23 OK..... Crazy you..
Today I said rm 24 still OK... Depend on you now... In or miss the boat.... No right no wrong.
*Topglov supermx*
We estimated the Top Glove target price of RM 83, which is already the highest target price in the market. Today, Affin Hwang said that it may be worth more than 110, but the real report given by Affin is the target price of 46.40.
Topglov's stock price will undoubtedly be higher, and it is also the champion of this time, this is because the company has the highest production volume in the world, good management team, and the financial situation is very healthy. Topglov has many advantages.
Supermx production volume is 24bils, topglov 78bils production volume, there is no doubt that topglov is 3 times higher than supermx. But the selling price of gloves (1000pcs) is undoubtedly higher than topglov. Compensating each other, supermx will not lose too much to topglov in terms of profit.
Topglov
For example: 78bils / 1000pcs = 78mils ctn
78mils ctn x 50 USD profit (expected to sell is 75 USD) = 3.9 bils USD profit for the whole year
Supermx
For example: 24bils / 1000pcs = 24mils ctn
24mils ctn x 95 USD profit (expected to sell is 120 USD) = 2.3 bils USD profit for the whole year
The annual profit forecast does not start again or increase the production volume forecast calculation. If the production volume and sales price increase, it will be very scary.
The annual profit difference of the two companies is 40%
But the number of company shares:
supermx 1.36bils
Topglov 2.7bils
=
Supermx eps rm5.39/per year
Topglov eps rm4.6/per year
Total eps supermx will be higher than topglov, but in term of profit will be topglov, this is because of the company's stock number.
Topglov fair forward pe 30
Supermx fair forward pe 20
Summary: topglov can have a high stock price, and supermx will not be low too.
Therefore, we chose top 3 to hedge the safety of the funds on hand, thus all funds will not be concentrated in one company."

Now then, which one is more valued for money ? which one can be more competitive in the market in general to the extent that the ASP can be adjusted in response to the changing economy ? It is believed that 80% of the consumers would go for B ( consumers are very smart these days) hence condom B gains more based on volumes.
When the demand is overwhelming ( due to blessing in disguise) ,both A and B stand to be winners . But when the demand is fading away( the reality will come sooner than you and me could imagine ) , who will stand as a winner in the end ? Mind you the blessing in disguise probably knocks once and would never recur.......... perhaps not in a million years.
but one thing for sure, apple is an evergreen product and its demand never fades . Why?, its because "" an apple a day keeps the doctor away """

LONDON (July 21): The University of Oxford's possible Covid-19 vaccine could be rolled out by the end of the year but there is no certainty, the lead developer of the vaccine said on Tuesday.
The experimental vaccine, which has been licensed to AstraZeneca, produced an immune response in early-stage clinical trials, data showed on Monday, preserving hopes it could be in use by the end of 2020.
""The end of the year target for getting vaccine roll-out, it's a possibility but there's absolutely no certainty about that because we need three things to happen,"" Sarah Gilbert told BBC Radio.
She said it needed to be shown to work in late-stage trials, there needed to be large quantities manufactured, and regulators had to agree quickly to license it for emergency use before large numbers of people could be vaccinated.
England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty and his deputy Jonathan Van-Tam took differing views on the potential timeline.
""The chance of us getting a vaccine before Christmas that actually is highly effective are, in my view, very low,"" Whitty told lawmakers.
Van-Tam, however, said he was ""cautiously optimistic that we will have some vaccine this side of Christmas.""
The Oxford scientists had eyed a million doses of the potential vaccine to be produced by September.
Although the deal with AstraZeneca has provided manufacturing capacity to do that, the lower prevalence of the novel coronavirus in Britain has complicated the process of proving its efficacy.
Late-stage trials crucial for providing data are under way in Brazil and South Africa and are due to start in the United States also.
There are no approved vaccines yet for Covid-19, but the World Health Organization has said AstraZeneca's"

世界八国领导人呼吁世界各国平等获得疫苗的权利。公共卫生专家表示，需要一个类似世卫组织的机制来协调全球疫苗的分配。
全球疫苗研发争先恐后
目前全世界的科学家和研究人员正在争先恐后地研发针对新冠病毒的有效疫苗，在世界卫生组织（WHO）跟踪下的就有140多家候选疫苗在研发中。通常情况下，一种有效、安全疫苗的研发需要数年的试验，以及额外的时间投入大规模生产；鉴于目前新冠病毒仍在全球许多国家肆虐，科学家们希望能够在12至18个月内研制出冠状病毒疫苗。
截至目前，全球已经有三支新冠病毒疫苗处于世界领先地位，分别由英国的牛津大学（University of Oxford/AstraZeneca）、中国的科兴生物技术（Sinovac Biotech），以及美国的（Moderna）生物技术公司开发研制。
世界八国领导人呼吁，在新冠疫苗研发成功后，必须保证全球能够平等地获得和享用疫苗。领导人联名发表文章的这八个国家是：加拿大、韩国、新西兰、埃塞俄比亚、南非、西班牙、瑞典和突尼斯。
美国公共卫生专家黄严忠认为，目前国际社会面临两个问题：首先，还没有看到任何迹象显示各个（有能力研发疫苗的）国家同意来让世界卫生组织分配，或者由世卫组织至少订出一个方案：比如，首先研发出疫苗的国家，把所生产的疫苗拿出一部分，比如10%捐赠给世界卫生组织，由世界卫生组织负责给那些贫穷或者发展中的国家配送。
“据我所知，目前国际社会还没有就这个问题有任何共识，”黄严忠说，“另外一个重要的问题，就是美国政府现在已经不信任世卫组织，并且正式宣布明年将退出世界卫生组织。”普遍认为美国要是先推出疫苗，将会先给美国人民注射疫苗。
由于研发疫苗需要耗费很大成本，基于利益考量，那些研发疫苗的药厂或者国家不可能与发展中的国家合作甚至让发展中的国家承包。这也是国际社会不能达成共识的原因。
普林斯顿大学的卡恩医生（Laura H. Kahn, MD）表示，不能确定美国民众届时是否愿意去排队接种新冠病毒疫苗，她对此表示担忧。“我们注意到目前许多人普遍对疫苗没有信心，甚至对科学也不信任。这是一个非常严重的公共卫生问题，因为疫苗是我们能够控制疾病流行的最佳策略，” 她说。
美国公共卫生专家黄严忠说，美国公众对疫苗的接受程度低，是防控新冠疫情的最棘手的问题之一。由于政治、社会和宗教文化等诸多方面的原因，美国政府不能强制全民接种疫苗。
另一方面，卡恩医生对美国之音说：“我认为我们不应抱有能在近期获得疫苗的希望。我们希望疫苗不仅要有效，而且要安全，而要确保这两者需要很长时间。”"

The leaders of the eight nations of the world called on all countries in the world to have equal access to vaccines. Public health experts said that a WHO-like mechanism is needed to coordinate global vaccine distribution.
Global vaccine research and development scrambling
At present, scientists and researchers all over the world are scrambling to develop effective vaccines against the new coronavirus. Under the World Health Organization (WHO) tracking, there are more than 140 vaccine candidates under development. Under normal circumstances, the development of an effective and safe vaccine requires several years of testing and additional time for large-scale production; given that the new coronavirus is still raging in many countries around the world, scientists hope to be able to develop it within 12 to 18 months The coronavirus vaccine.
Up to now, there are three new coronavirus vaccines in the world, which are developed by the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca in the UK, Sinovac Biotech in China, and Moderna in the United States. Development.
The leaders of the eight countries in the world called for the successful development of the new crown vaccine, it is necessary to ensure that the world can obtain and enjoy the vaccine on an equal basis. The eight countries where the leaders jointly published articles are: Canada, South Korea, New Zealand, Ethiopia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden and Tunisia.
American public health expert Huang Yanzhong believes that the international community is currently facing two problems: First, there has not been any sign that countries (that are capable of developing vaccines) agree to let the World Health Organization allocate it, or that the World Health Organization has at least one Solution: For example, the country that first developed the vaccine would give a part of the vaccine produced, such as donating 10% to the World Health Organization, which is responsible for distribution to poor or developing countries.
""As far as I know, the international community has not yet reached any consensus on this issue,"" Huang Yanzhong said. ""Another important issue is that the US government no longer trusts the WHO and has officially announced that it will withdraw from the World Health Organization next year. ""It is generally believed that if the United States launches a vaccine first, it will vaccinate the American people first.
Due to the high cost of developing vaccines, based on interest considerations, it is impossible for pharmaceutical companies or countries that develop vaccines to cooperate with or even contract to developing countries. This is also the reason why the international community cannot reach a consensus.
Dr. Laura H. Kahn (MD) of Princeton University said that she is not sure whether the American people will be willing to queue up for the new coronavirus vaccine by then. She expressed concern about this. ""We have noticed that many people generally do not have confidence in vaccines or even science. This is a very serious public health problem because vaccines are the best strategy for us to control the epidemic,"" she said.
American public health expert Huang Yanzhong said that the low level of acceptance of vaccines by the American public is one of the most difficult problems in preventing and controlling the new crown epidemic. Due to political, social, religious and cultural reasons, the US government cannot force the entire population to be vaccinated.
On the other hand, Dr. Kahn told VOA: “I don’t think we should have any hope of getting a vaccine in the near future. We hope that the vaccine will not only be effective but also safe, and it will take a long time to ensure both. ."""

Based on Fundamental analysis our current PE guideline is approx 57.14 (Based on 1.75% of BNM base rate) however KPJ PE=17.47@RM0.83 thus the actual price for KPJ should be RM2.71.
Covid-19 only good for medical sector (more clearly is protective medical equipment “glove, mask, face shield and etc” and diagnosis instrument “thermo scanners, PCR tester and etc” For Malaysia top glove, harta, kossan and supermx all are the first round winners.
For the last stage of vaccination development, now is the time to look for the next gem but unfortunately our country is impossible to produce these vaccine. The only vaccine we can get is import and we hv 20+mil ppl need to be vaccinated. Early stage of vaccine must be very expensive and gov won’t sponsor. We only can get vaccinated through private hospital no matter for travel or job requirement or just stay safe. Based on 2019, KPJ recorded 2,629,878 outpatients @ net profit 226.7mil with 28 hospitals overall the state. If half of 20mil ppl go KPJ for vaccination so approx net profit can reach up to 1bil. And u need to know tat those vaccine isn’t 1 injection for lifetime (like seasonally flu vaccine) and must get it semi or annually. RM1k-2k per vaccine per yrs for everyone to stay safe is new normal of post covid-19. And it is long term investment value of KPJ."

“Based on our estimates, if ASPs were to increase by 8-10% m-o-m each month, our earnings estimates for FY21E will increase by a further 24%-42%.
“Based on a PE multiple of 30 times, the fair value of Top Glove shares would be around RM56.20 to RM63.60.
“However, if we were to base it on 52 times (similar to Hatalega Holdings Bhd valuation), the fair value of Top Glove could surpass RM110, which implies an upside of more than 344% from the current level,” it said.
Affin Hwang said it was raising its earnings forecasts for FY20E-22E by 35%-310%, imputing a higher ASP assumption.
“We are not overly concerned by the detention order issued by the US Customs and Border Protection and expect it to be resolved within the next 2-4 weeks.
“We estimate the impact on earnings for FY20E is around 5-6%. However, if the issue prolongs, Top Glove will have to re-ship it goods to other countries, though it could benefit from higher spot prices."

Comment is free of speeches, no people will take the gun ask you invest any company, just an advise.

Because only this two company can maximize your profit and market everyone also know. This two company is the most benefit during covid-19. You and me and everyone also have limited money, my opinion is why dont invest at this two most strong faudamental company and most benefit companies to maximize our profits? If you no agree than you can choose invest others company invest, no need listen to me right? You are adults, money is yours, you should take care your own money. I just talk out the facts, Kossan is lagging company, business model too conservative that market everyone also know. Director agm told you selling price wont increase much, Bloomberg interview director also told you selling price wont increase much, than you should know the result right? Kossan share price up is purely because of glove trend, totally dont have market expectations result support, but Topglove and Supermax have, so you understand?"

Laggard in share price; maintain BUY
Kossan is our top pick: (i) Stock is a laggard with its share price only
gaining 245% YTD (Top Glove: +470% YTD); (ii) ASPs will be raised
aggressively in the coming months, potentially matching that of Top
Glove. We maintain our FY22E EPS but raised our FY20-21E EPS by
48%/201% on higher ASP assumptions. Our new TP is MYR19.50 (+78%) on
a lower FY21E P/E of 16x (from 27x previously; 5-year mean: 18x).
Kossan could be included in the FBM KLCI in the upcoming review in Nov.
Will match market’s ASPs
Kossan has secured orders until Jun 2021 and is taking orders for 2H21.
Its blended ASP (including spot) is also on an uptrend (2Q20: +5% QoQ)
and its ASP hikes are more aggressive in Jul-Aug (Jul: +20% vs. 2Q20, Aug:
+40% vs. 2Q20). We think its ASP hikes will remain aggressive in the
coming months as it tries to catch up with the market’s ASPs. Spot
currently accounts for 10% of its volume and it could be raised to 15%. Its
spot ASPs is USD60-85/k pieces now (+2-3x of the normal ASPs).
Moderate capacity growth in FY20-21E
Plant 19 (3b pcs p.a.) will be fully-commercialised by Aug 2020 (+10% to
32b pcs p.a.). For FY21-22, Kossan has lined up the following expansion:
(i) Plant 20 (Klang) – To commercialise in 1H21 with a capacity of 1.4b
pcs p.a.; (ii) Plant 21 (Phase 1, Klang) – To commercialise in 2H21 with a
capacity of 2b pcs p.a.; (iii) Plant 21 (Phase 2, Klang) – To commercialise
in 1H22 with a capacity of 3b pcs p.a.; (iv) Plant 22 (Bidor) – To
commercialise in 2H22 with a capacity of 4b pcs p.a. We estimate that
its effective capacity will grow 13%/7%/17% in FY20-22E.
Raise FY20-21E earnings forecasts
With the industry players matching Top Glove’s high ASPs, we think the
ASPs could sustain at the high levels in 1Q21 and potentially trend lower
gradually from 2Q21 as the new supply alleviate the acute shortage. We
raise our ASP by 38%/132%/37% for FY20-22E and also raise our NBR cost
by 35%/89%/89%. Our FY20-21E EPS is raised by 48%/201% while our
FY22E EPS is unchanged as the higher costs offset the higher ASP."

Its market capitalisation ballooned to RM21.36 billion, more than Telekom Malaysia Bhd's market cap of RM14.98 billion.
Kossan took the centre stage as analysts were raising earnings forecasts after an analyst briefing last week.
The frenzied buying interest in the stock was driven by the optimism that the rubber glove maker, like its peers, would post record-breaking earnings in the current financial year ending Dec 31, 2020 (FY20) and the year after. More importantly, it is expanding quickly to ride the strong global demand growth."

With gloves, bursa healthcare indices has seen making an impulsive rally high at 4,122 (22/7/2020) before correction. The indices has seeing a bullish turning after making low 3,658 (24/7/2020). We think that is an extended wave three, meaning that more upside will come as the fourth wave retracement may have unfolded completely in a zig-zag A-B-C waves. As such, we see potential rally for glove sectors towards the important fibonacci extension target around 4,430 (161,8%) or higher 4.905 (261,8%) area!

Newsroom, quoting Foodstuffs head of corporate affairs and corporate social responsibility Antoinette Laird, reported that the Foodstuffs supermarket chain had pulled Top Glove's disposable rubber gloves off its shelves while investigating whether they might have been made in slave-like working conditions.
""New Zealand’s biggest supermarket chain is also checking the gloves being worn in-store by its staff after allegations of migrant labour abuse at two Malaysian Top Glove factories,"" Newsroom reported."

How share buy back works?
In a buyback, a company buys its own shares directly from the market or offers its shareholders the option of tendering their shares directly to the company at a fixed price. A share buyback reduces the number of outstanding shares, which increases both the demand for the shares and the price."

Russia is aiming for an approved COVID-19 vaccine in the next fortnight to portray itself as a global science leader, but there are major concerns over a lack of data and testing

Russia is aiming to have a COVID-19 vaccine approved for public use by August 10, which would make it the first approved vaccine in the world, Russian officials told CNN.
Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, compared the vaccine's quick development to Russia launching the first successful satellite in 1957, beating the US to it.
""It's a Sputnik moment,"" he said. ""Americans were surprised when they heard Sputnik's beeping. It's the same with this vaccine. Russia will have got there first."""

Before already told you Kossan share price up is purely because of glove trend, totally dont have market expectations result support. Now harta already announced result, people already can estimate Kossan earning, you think Kossan can go how far? Always remember, share price 100% = result.

IMO, Kossan is still part of the team play with the other big 4 in Gloves. Currently the stock prices might not be as stellar as its peers (supermx and topglov) but it's prices move less volatile as well. suitable for people with less risk appetite. Besides, within one week up 35% is considered not bad, better than 90% of the stocks in KLSE if I may say. Just my humble 2 cents.
Hence, Investing in the market is tough, people only share after stock prices go up, then reinstate the 'Fear of Missing Out' mindset. Chillout guys, everyone has their own risk appetite; as long as investor here still earn money, big or small is considered very good already. I wish everyone reading this good luck and hope your investments give many returns regardless of which counter you chooses!"

In the case of Trailing PE and future PE . the latter is used more than the former . In a nutshell , i fancy future PE . what is past is past but still useful to be taken as reference ( no matter what , it is still the valid past record).
Current PE of suprem is 219 where the market expects superm to achieve at least 400% growth in their next coming QR ( assumed to be factored by half). Any thing short of 400% growth would be backfired while the current PE of Kosun is 106. Given the same growth as superm of 400%, Kossun's TP would be over the moon. in a nutshell, it has more rooms for appreciation slowly but steadily.
Taking about OBM and OEM business model. OBM need to be sold through its own selected outlets due to brand status whereas OEM could be sold through widespread dealership or distributorship with wide networkings to increase the volumes. Profit earning is not an issue here as the higher the volumes, the more the profit earnings is made.
Glove is glove. After use, it is disposable and nothing is great about it. What matters most are the production of gloves is under ISO and the registration of FDA is duly done along with other international certifications......."

Since then the price of these Gloves shares has exploded. So it's not surprising that many wants to go into Gloves and Health Care..

Reiterate BUY with a higher TP of RM22.80
We revised upward our earnings forecasts for 2020-22 by 70%-140% to factor in
the higher ASP trend. We have also raised our TP to RM22.80 (from RM11.20), but
based on a lower CY21E PER of 28x (from 33x), which is at +1SD above its 3-year
pre-2019 average. We are using the average valuation from pre-2019 as it was not
disrupted by the recent surge in earnings due to COVID-19. We keep our BUY call,
as we believe that the current share price has yet to price in the full earnings
potential. Despite the sharp stock price gains ytd, we think it is still too early to take
profit, as earnings could surprise on the upside given that the ASP revision trend is
still positive, in our view."

Not invest at no benefit company, as investors we want is maximize our profit, not fall in love with any company. During covid-19 only Topglove and Supermax business model is most perfect, you should only invest in this two company to maximize your profit. Start from covid-19, you can invest at every big 4 company, after 1) Kossan announced result only improve yoy 10%, net profit less than Supermax, Bloomberg interview Kossan, director already told you ASP wont increase much, than you should cut off all your Kossan. 2) After Harta announced the result net profit less than Supermax, the business model same like Kossan already sign contract, cant simply increase Selling price. CNN interview Harta, the director say they will focus on exciting customer, you should cut off all your Harta. 3) You should study deep Supermax and Topglove, which company business model is most benefit during covid-19 and can growth faster and depend the right situation to the final winner company to invest big. I can told you the final winner during covid-19 100% is Topglove because it have the world biggest production. As a supplier, quantity is very important, It can give you a great advantage when negotiating prices with customers. Kossan and Harta now is totally out especially Kossan, Kossan totally dont have any strong point let us to invest. Harta have NGC factory and AMG glove, Supermax have OBM business model, Topglove is the world biggest production company, but Kossan have any strong point let us invest during covid-19?

My opinion is dont wait and buy big Topglove, Kyy buy Topglove cost RM25, now RM27 only. After announced result i believe it will have more than 1billion net profit. Share price at least stand above RM40 to RM45, the gap is still higer than you invest Supermax now. For now Supermax share price is considered fair value for this quarter result. Supermax November will announced more better results, big fund October or November just will came back to Supermax. I believe from tomorrow start whole market will strong focus on Topglove because September it will announced super crazy bombastic result, grab the opportunity of Topglove and dont let it go."

Until next years if WHO no announced vaccine success, Topglove share price possible more than RM100 base on my calculations. You can go do a research this year second half Topglove increase how much production? August start how much the selling price they increase? 30%? If increase 30% for Topglove production quantity,
how much Topglove can earn and growth? Based on my calculations End of this years 2020 Topglove net profit will earn more than 2 billion, you can see until years end how crazy the Topglove share price will be?

Dont touch those company without any market expectations result support. Kossan share price up is 100% because of glove trend, dont have good enough result support, for my advice dont touch this kind of company, the director too conservative, company very hard growth fast like Topglove and Supermax.

Because this two company have very crazy good prospects and it can easily increase selling price to help company make more profit. Now Supermax and Topglove i can say is undervalue and future earning if you do your homework calculate will feel very crazy. Topglove September result net profit will more than 1billion, December quarter result will more than 2 billion, you can go calculate the PE and forward PE. Supermax 24b production but Topglove 80b production, the profit you can calculate is Supermax 3x production. Supermax have only 24b production but the revenue almost near with Harta, net profit higher than Harta and Kossan, report say ASP still not show at this quarter, means November result will more better. You can calculate this years second half Supermax will increase more 2.2b production, Topglove if no wrong is 5 to 7 b production (correct me if i am wrong), so you can calculate how bombastic the company coming quarter result will be? Topglove and Supermax already tell you how the future will be? Why still want reject the facts? You have how much of money? I believe everyone have limited money to invest, than why dont focus only on Topglove and Supermax to maximize your profit? Next show should be Topglove because Supermax already announced the result, market will focus on Topglove because September will announced super crazy result, and the margin profit gap you can earn is the higest compare with other glove counter. If vaccine continue cant be successful i believe Topglove share price more than RM100 is not a dream. I believe vaccine at least need another 1 years time just can launch, they need time to do testing make sure 100% no effect just can inject to healthy people body, and dont forget covid-19 virus keep changing the type.

Based on Fundamental analysis our current PE guideline is approx 57.14 (Based on 1.75% of BNM base rate) thus the actual price for KPJ should be RM2.71.
Covid-19 only good for medical sector (more clearly is protective medical equipment “glove, mask, face shield and etc” and diagnosis instrument “thermo scanners, PCR tester and etc” For Malaysia top glove, harta, kossan and supermx all are the first round winners.
For the last stage of vaccination development, now is the time to look for the next gem but unfortunately our country is impossible to produce these vaccine. The only vaccine we can get is import and we hv 20+mil ppl need to be vaccinated. Early stage of vaccine must be very expensive and gov won’t sponsor. We only can get vaccinated through private hospital no matter for travel or job requirement or just stay safe. Based on 2019, KPJ recorded 2,629,878 outpatients @ net profit 226.7mil with 28 hospitals overall the state. If half of 20mil ppl go KPJ for vaccination so approx net profit can reach up to 1bil. And u need to know tat those vaccine isn’t 1 injection for lifetime (like seasonally flu vaccine) and must get it semi or annually. RM200-300 per vaccine per yrs for everyone to stay safe is new normal of post covid-19. And it is long term investment value of KPJ."

Most of the commentators on Fantastic Four or Tier 2 and Tier 3 Glove stocks forum are expressing their fear that the Russian vaccine will be the saviour of the Covid 19 pandemic. As a result, there will be no more demand for gloves and investors should sell their holdings as soon as possible.
They are misleading investors. What is the truth? Investors must know the truth.
The Vaccine Testing Process
The World Health Organization has not received enough information on the Russian COVID-19 vaccine to evaluate it, the assistant director of its regional branch, the Pan American Health Organization, Jarbas Barbosa has said..
The Moscow-based Association of Clinical Trials Organizations (ACTO), a trade body representing the world’s top drug makers in Russia, released an open letter urging the Russian Health Ministry to postpone approval of the vaccine until Phase 3 trials had been successfully completed.
“It is during this phase that the main evidence of a vaccine’s efficacy is collected, as well as information on adverse reactions that could appear in certain groups of patients: people with weakened immunity, people with concomitant diseases and so forth,” reads the letter from ACTO, published last Monday.
According to The New York Times Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker, there are currently 8 vaccines in large-scale Phase 3 efficacy tests. Typically, Phase 3 trials are large enough to reveal any evidence of rare, potentially life-threatening side effects. The FDA has said a COVID-19 vaccine will need to protect at least 50 percent of vaccinated persons to receive agency approval in the United States.
Researchers around the world are developing more than 165 vaccines against the coronavirus, and 30 vaccines are in human trials. Vaccines typically require years of research and testing before reaching the clinic, but scientists are racing to produce a safe and effective vaccine by next year.
PRECLINICAL TESTING: Scientists give the vaccine to animals such as mice or monkeys to see if it produces an immune response.
PHASE 1 SAFETY TRIALS: Scientists give the vaccine to a small number of people to test safety and dosage as well as to confirm that it stimulates the immune system.
PHASE 2 EXPANDED TRIALS: Scientists give the vaccine to hundreds of people split into groups, such as children and the elderly, to see if the vaccine acts differently in them. These trials further test the vaccine’s safety and ability to stimulate the immune system.
PHASE 3 EFFICACY TRIALS: Scientists give the vaccine to thousands of people and wait to see how many become infected, compared with volunteers who received a placebo. These trials can determine if the vaccine protects against the coronavirus. In June, the F.D.A. said that a coronavirus vaccine would have to protect at least 50% of vaccinated people to be considered effective. In addition, Phase 3 trials are large enough to reveal evidence of relatively rare side effects that might be missed in earlier studies.
APPROVED: Regulators in each country review the trial results and decide whether to approve the vaccine or not. During a pandemic, a vaccine may receive emergency use authorization before getting formal approval. Once a vaccine is licensed, researchers continue to monitor people who receive it to make sure it’s safe and effective.

BERLIN (Aug 12): German Health Minister Jens Spahn on Wednesday said Russia’s Covid-19 vaccine had not been sufficiently tested, adding the aim was to have a safe product rather than just being first to start vaccinating people. President Vladimir Putin announced on Tuesday that Russia
had become the first country to grant regulatory approval to a Covid-19 vaccine after less than two months of human testing.
Moscow’s decision to grant approval before final trials have been completed has raised concerns among some experts. “It can be dangerous to start vaccinating millions, if not billions, of people too early because it could pretty much kill the acceptance of vaccination if it goes wrong, so I’m very
sceptical about what’s going on in Russia.
“It’s not about being first somehow — it’s about having an effective, tested and therefore safe vaccine,” Spahn added.

Investors should know that no stock can go up or drop continuously for whatever reason. After sometime it will change its trend. The one which was going up will drop and the one which dropping will go up. As a result, many investors are in a dilemma to sell or to buy some more at cheaper prices. There are many reasons for this phenomenon.
One common reason is that short term investors or day traders frequently buy or sell to make a bit of money. They take advantage of the price fluctuation to make money. Studies has shown that short term investors cannot make much money due to transaction cost. Serious long-term investors always make more money.
Some investors sold because they thought the reason for them to buy the stock is no longer valid. For example, Russian President Putin recently announced that his daughter was inoculated with an unproven Covid 19 vaccine. This has created a lot of confusion and many investors rushed to sell their glove stocks to depress the share prices. As an example, Supermax and Top Glove each dropped about 10%. They rebounded yesterday because the Russian doctor who vaccinated Putin’s daughter with his unproven vaccine resigned after he was told that all vaccines have to undergo phase 3 testing. Putin’s daughter may soon die?
It has been a productive week. I managed to capitalise on the sell off for Supermax, Top Gloves and Hartalega. Unfortunately, I run out of fund this time to top up Kossan since I have used up my fund to buy her 3 sisters.
Enjoy your weekend ...

前幾天消息一出，Kossan和Supermax的股票上漲，而IJM的股票則下跌了。
到底什麼是MSCI指數呢？
#1 MSCI是Morgan Stanley Capital International (摩根士丹利資本國際)的縮寫，而MSCI指數就是由Morgan Stanley投資銀行所編制的指數
#2 MSCI指數有超過160,000種股票指數，涵蓋全球，主要以國家、地區、市場、產業等等編制的。國家類型的指數就有馬來西亞指數、日本指數、韓國指數、台灣指數等等；地區類型的就有歐元區指數；產業類型的就有能源指數等等。此外，MSCI也以小型股、中型股和大型股來做編制指數。
#3 MSCI會按照標準挑選成分股，而這些股票大部分都是各個國家中穩健獲利及有競爭力的代表性個股和產業龍頭股。
#4 大家之所以會對MSCI所編制的指數感到陌生，是因為這些指數都是給國際資本（如：大型的退休基金）作為參考的。全球超過 80％基金經理是以 MSCI 的全球指數，作為資金配置與避險策略的參考指標。
#5 基金經理在挑選股票的時候，可以自行研究每個國家的經濟成長、通貨膨脹率及其它指數來作為參考的標準。但是他們更希望能夠參考某個地區、某個國家或某個產業更特定、更統一的指標，來決定是否買入。
#6 假設今天基金經理A想要投資在某一個國家的市場，那他就可以參考MSCI指數中，哪個國家的指數表現得最好，他就投資在哪個國家的市場。
#7 MSCI Malaysia Index和MSCI Malaysia Small Cap Index两种，是MSCI指數中涵蓋了馬來西亞股票的指數
#8 當某支股票被列入MSCI指數成分股時，就代表這支股票表現很好，公司也有前景；而被淘汰的股票則就代表該公司表現差，失去了競爭力。
#9 由於許多基金經理會依據MSCI指數來投資，所以入選的股票在未來就有更大的機會被更多的國際資本投資，而被淘汰的股票則會失去國際資本的投資。"

In 1h chart today, indication for a completed wave (A) is unfolded from the low of 3,564 (Fib ratio 38,2 - 3,574) level, with a sharp degree rebound on wave (B) which probably underway. Trade this rebound that to see potential rally for glove sectors towards to test previous ATH at 4,520 before wave C) to kick in!

@ stockraider
Are those numbers accurate? 50 million doses initially and 10 million doses a month after. 2 doses per person is required for Sinovac's vaccine. Indonesia population is 267 million. So it will take 48 months to vaccinate Indonesia's entire population.
At that rate, the virus would have infected the entire population before the vaccination can be completed. Mutated like the influenza virus at least twice to reinfect the population again. I guess the vaccine is for essential people only."

The question going forward is that if there is no vaccine in-sight in the short term, what are we going to do about it? Definitely, we need to embrace the new norm and better hygiene and probably a faster response to outbreak, thus all healthcare related stock will be doing well."

Aug 21 2020 >> The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has said that while there is hope for a vaccine against Covid-19, one might never be found. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news briefing there was ""no silver bullet at the moment - and there might never be"". So, how can you be sure that a safe and high efficacy vaccine is coming? The question going forward is that if there is no vaccine in-sight in the short to medium term, what are we going to do about it? Definitely, we need to embrace the new norm and better hygiene and probably a faster response to outbreak, thus all healthcare related stock will be doing well. Please bear in mind that till today the Scientists do not know well about Covid-19, and it's not about how many companies are developing the vaccine."

Covid19 will be there and still far from over. The demand for gloves is high seeing the current infected numbers over 23 million. There are still many months ahead before an effective vaccine will be available to the public.
Even oneday when the vaccine is out, with current world population of 7.3 billion, one vaccine given to each person will have one pair of gloves used. That means the glove supplies might be out of stock!

Acting managing director Mohamed Iqbal Abdul Rahman said the investment for the fill-and-finish process would be around RM2mil.
He added that the vaccine is suitable to be bottled at the company’s facility in Puchong as it is a sterile liquid injection plant.
“There has to be a sterile environment for the vaccine to be bottled. We already have it, and it is furthermore a good manufacturing practice-approved plant. We can bottle the Covid-19 vaccine immediately once it is ready. Our capacity is around 10 million doses per month on 10 doses vial.
“I expect the vaccine to be available either by the first or second quarter of next year as it is in clinical trial in some countries. Most of the potential vaccine developers are optimistic the vaccine would be ready by year-end, ” he said at a press briefing."

KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 17): Mechanical and electrical engineering works specialist Bintai Kinden Corp Bhd, which saw its share price soar to a three-year high today, said it is venturing into developing a vaccine for Covid-19 through a partnership with a US pharmaceutical company.
In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, Bintai Kinden said it inked a memorandum of understanding with vaccine research firm Nugenerex Immuno-Oncology (Generex) to fund and manage a synthetic peptide vaccine for Covid-19.
Generex, which is principally involved in robust research and development in creating on-demand peptide vaccines to control pandemic viruses, has developed its proprietary, patented li-Key immune system activation technology that holds promise for stopping viral outbreaks like the current pandemic."

KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 25): The run-up among glove counters may have peaked, said AmBank Research, which has downgraded its call on the sector to “neutral” from “overweight” in view that the share prices are fully valued.
In a research note this afternoon, AmBank Research opined that the elevated average selling prices (ASPs) enjoyed by glovemakers “will begin to taper off in 1Q21”.
The research house has Top Glove Corp Bhd, Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd and Hartalega Holdings Bhd under its coverage.
“Share prices of all of the glove companies under our coverage have exceeded their target prices,” it said.
“We believe that at current share price levels, the valuations for glove companies under our coverage have fully priced in the companies’ earnings outlook,” it said.
It added that “PE valuations are demanding” pointing out that Top Glove is currently trading at CY21F PE of 43.3 times, which is two standard deviations (SD) higher than its three-year average forward PE of 28.9 times, while Kossan Rubber’s CY21F PE of 26.0 times is almost 1SD higher than its three-year average forward PE of 23.7 times, and Hartalega is trading at a CY21F PE of 40.9 times, which is slightly higher than its three-year average PE of 39.5 times.
AmBank Research noted that the planned capacity increase of 126 billion pieces or 54% by end-2022 “will more than offset” demand increase, and that the recent strides in Covid-19 vaccines will affect ASPs as well.
AmBank downgraded Top Glove and Kossan to “hold” with unchanged fair values of RM25.70 and RM15.74 respectively, while maintaining a “hold” call on Hartalega with fair value of RM18.74. Currently, no glove stocks in Malaysia have any “sell” call by analysts covering the companies."

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the world economy. In June 2020, the International
Monetary Fund in its latest World Economic Outlook (“WEO”) report has revised the global growth for 2020
to -4.9% (April 2020 WEO: -3.0%) indicating a more negative impact than anticipated, with a recovery that is
projected to be more gradual than previously forecasted.
Against this backdrop however, the need for personal protective equipment, including rubber gloves has
increased significantly. In its July 2020 industry briefing, the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers
Association (“MARGMA”) projected global glove demand to grow 20% to 330 billion pieces in 2020 (2019:
298 billion pieces), with Malaysia expected to export 220 billion pieces of gloves valued at RM21.8 billion in
the current year compared with 170 billion pieces worth RM17.4 billion in 2019.
The Technical Rubber Products division has been impacted by the Movement Control Order as well as the
slowdown in the infrastructure and automotive industry as a result of the pandemic. However, the TRP’s
division only constitutes less than 4% of revenue currently. The division has since resumed full operations after
the government began easing the lockdown measures and the Group expects this division will remain
profitable.
For the Gloves division, the COVID-19 outbreak started in China and subsequently spread to Europe and the
USA in March 2020. New cases continue to be high with concerns of a second wave occurring as countries
around the world reopen their economies. As a result, the demand for protective gloves grew exponentially,
leading to a supply-demand imbalance. With our selling prices for gloves quoted 45-60 days before delivery,
the increase in prices started to be reflected in June 2020 and we will definitely see a significant quarter-on-
quarter increase in average selling prices in the 3rd quarter and especially in the 4th quarter of FY2020.
Premised on the above and with additional capacity of around 15% - 20%, management is confident of a further
step-up in revenue and profit growth on a quarter-on-quarter basis in the 3rd quarter and more significantly in
the 4th quarter of FY2020."

KRI wasn’t able to benefit much in 1H20 as the selling prices had been locked in before the spread of COVID-19; hence it is playing catch-up (in terms of selling prices) in 2H20. Nevertheless, the guidance for post-Sep’20 deliveries is similar to its peers’ at around +5% mom, which we believe is reasonable given the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases.

Expect a solid 2QFY20. We expect its 2QFY20 PATAMI, which is due to be released by end-Aug, to be higher QoQ and YoY in tandem with solid sector growth due to higher volume and ASP, new capacity expansion from Plant 19 and better margins due to higher operating efficiencies from new plants. For illustration purposes, based on our net margin forecast of 20%, volume sales of 5b to 6b pieces and ASP of USD23/1000/pieces (USDMYR4.20); 2QFY20 PATAMI could come in at between RM96m and RM116m (+49% to +84% QoQ; +73% to +113% YoY) bringing 1HFY20 to between RM161m (+41%) and RM181m (+58%), at 24%/31% our/consensus full-year forecasts. However, due to the runaway ASP, we raise our FY20E/FY21E net profit by 33%/23% taking into account higher EBITDA margin, which we raised from 23%/25% to 28%/28%."

Kossan is also expecting to increase its ad-hoc/ spot orders allocation up to c.15% of its total capacity (currently c.10%). The sustained strong demand with orders filled up till end-1H21 and ASPs being fixed 2 months prior delivery, could see the increase in prices to be fully reflected in 2H20. Overall, we estimate that selling prices will continue to increase until end of 2020 and stabilize in 1H2021 before gradually decreasing. We have raised our assumptions accordingly, as these were not forthcoming previously."

Obviously they need to read the notes to the qr in more detail. Increasing ASP prices only reflected in June and onwards. Additional capacity of 15 to 20 % in Q3 and beyond. This will add up to a exponentially record breaking next qr. The same applies to the other gloves as well. The next qrs reported in 3 months time for all gloves will be reflecting massive growth in revenues and profits.

Mabel's State energy company Petroliam Nasional, better known as Petronas, and South Korean chemical giant LG Chem have inked an agreement to build a manufacturing plant in Malaysia to produce nitrile butadiene latex -- a core raw material for making synthetic rubber gloves.
The manufacturing plant is slated to begin production in 2023 to tap the growing market for rubber gloves, in which Malaysia is already a global leader. Major manufacturers in the country include Mabel's Top Glove, Hartalega, Supermax and Kossan.
Construction of the plant will begin in 2021 at Petronas' petrochemical complex in the southern state of Johor, and it will have an initial production capacity of 200,000 tons of nitrile butadiene latex a year
Target date is 2023 for a Purrfect 10..

Base on my estimate the selling price only increase 5 to 6%, from here you can see the director is too conservative and you need go study the company business model. Of course we know Kossan November result will be better, report also have write. But the problem is Kossan Selling Price can increase how much? Let say we estimate November Kossan result can hit 300mil, from 131,057mil to 300,000mil growth is how much? If Topglove December result from 1.2b to 2b above it will improve how much? If Supermax November from 399mil to 1b growth is how much? Invest you must compare each company and calculate who growth is faster and can maximize your profit.

Yeah, production + 6%, ASP maybe + 8%? Still worse than Harta production +8.5% and ASP maybe +15%?
I mean in usual times these companies (Kossan & Harta) will do better.
One big hole/empty promise is 20% allocation to spot order, clearly this is not fulfilled. Or maybe they just charge new customers with the same low price? Unbelievable."

个人看法： Kossan取得历史新高营业额和盈利，属于非常好的业绩（至于市场买不买单就不知道了）目前 PE 也降到了 61。如果接下来手套需求量可以维持强劲，手套销售价维持在高水平，接下来预计可以看到管理层所说更好的盈利增长。公司这个季度取得10.25的eps, 如果假设接下来三个季度可以取得20-25%的增长, 那么总合eps：10.25+14+17+20=61.25， 给予一个 PE 20-30 的合理价，那计算 eps 61.25*20-30= RM12～RM18. 现在股价 RM14.64算是处于一个接近合理的价位。 *以上纯粹个人的猜测预算，并没有任何买卖的建议。
Fair value RM12-RM18. If you guys calculate Topglove and Supermax? Kindergarten students also know need invest at Topglove and Supermax right?"

In a nutshell,kosan is undervalued.

Business Insider
salarshani@businessinsider.com (Sarah Al-Arshani)
,Business Insider•August 26, 2020
The Center for Disease Control quietly modified its testing guidelines on Monday and no longer requires people who are asymptomatic to get tested for the virus.
Experts are concerned this will hinder our understanding of the true scope of the outbreak in the US.
Last week, the World Health Organization said the virus is mainly being spread by young people who are unaware that they are infected.
In July, the CDC itself said that 40% of people infected with COVID-19 are asymptomatic and that the transmission rate from those who show no symptoms was 75%."

DANONCE TECHNOLOGY (7114)
SAMCHEM (5147)
Both are suppliers to the glove and healthcare industry and they are now trading at a relatively low PE ratio and stock price. D'nonce is an especially good pick as its Q2 is coming out in 30 days time and for the last 3 quarters it has been recording profit growth. The recent corporate presentation and management mentioned they're currently experiencing very strong orders and are operating at maximum capacity, in tandem with the robust demand for gloves.
From its recent corporate presentation, and google map, we can guess with high accuracy that TOPGLOV Thailand and Sri Trang Glove are their clients.
Currently projecting a base case RM 15m of net profit for FY2021, which translate into 5.7c eps FY2021. Extrapolating that into 15x PE based on conservative valuation. TP by analyst: 0.8-1.0
Samchem is a chemicals company supplying chemicals to glove companies to manufacture gloves. Also a solid company with strong fundamentals and growing profits. TP by analyst: 1.23
This is not a buy call, just for the members hedging thoughts. Let me know if you agree after you read up more on these stocks and their business."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001389.jsp?ftp=134","Aug 28, 2020 8:59 PM","thestockoracle","Please note that the idea of hedging is meant to counter the turbulence of the glove stocks. I still continue to believe Kossan has its own potential upside but with market sentiments swaying, it would be advisable to not put all your eggs in one basket. At the same time, I do not advocate speculating in penny stocks like the pharmas. My definition of penny stocks are stocks with no proven track record and are trading at ridiculous prices relative to their profits.
I only would advocate hedging stocks with the following criteria:
1. proven track record and profit growth.
2. strong management team and visible corporate earnings,
3. transparent management ideas such as presentations and press releases so we know what is going on with the company.
4. glove related preferably as glove demand will continue to be elevated.
5. strong fundamentals and relatively low PE ratio
6. current price still demonstrates an upside (massive upside 30% or more) and not over-priced so that there is still gain to be made without investors taking ridiculous risks."

at current kossan price (say rm15) 400,000 shares = rm6 mil

Infections have been reported in more than 210 countries and territories since the first cases were identified in China in December 2019.
The United States are the worst hit country with more than 182,000 cases of death and almost 6 million registered confirmed cases.
They are followed by Brazil. Just over six months after registering its first case of the Covid-19, Brazil crossed the grim threshold of 120,000 people killed by Covid-19 on Saturday (Aug 29), with no end in sight to the crisis.
The country of 212 million people has now registered 120,262 deaths from the virus and 3,846,153 infections, the health ministry said in its daily update.
Brazil is just the second country to surpass a death toll of 120,000 in the pandemic, after the United States, where the number killed is now more than 182,000.
Unlike in Europe and Asia, where the virus hit hard and then subsided, Brazil's outbreak is advancing at a slow but steady pace, said Christovam Barcellos, a researcher at public health institute Fiocruz.
""Brazil is unique in the world. Since the start of the pandemic, its curve has been different from other countries', much slower,"" he told AFP.
""It has stabilised now, but at a very dangerous level: nearly 1,000 deaths and 40,000 cases per day.... And Brazil still isn't past the peak.""
The pandemic has also turned political in Latin America's largest country.
President Jair Bolsonaro has downplayed the virus and attacked governors and mayors who imposed lockdown measures, arguing the economic damage is worse than the disease itself.
The far-right leader is instead pushing the drug hydroxychloroquine as the solution to the health crisis, despite studies showing it is ineffective against Covid-19.
He again said Saturday the controversial medication had ""saved thousands of victims' lives"" in Brazil.
Bolsonaro even took what he called the ""right-wing"" drug himself when he was diagnosed with the virus in July.
""It's shocking the way (Bolsonaro) has handled this. It's not just his denialism.... He has often crossed the line of disrespecting victims,"" said political analyst Michael Mohallem of the Getulio Vargas Foundation.
""The number of deaths is scandalously high,"" he told AFP. ""I think someday he'll have to pay the price.""
The virus has meanwhile spread to more fragile demographic groups and to the interior of the country.
Impoverished residents of overcrowded favelas, or slums, have been hit especially hard.
So have indigenous groups in the Amazon rainforest, who have a history of vulnerability to outside diseases."

Alarm as FDA willing to issue Covid-19 vaccine before stringent safety testing
FDA under intensifying pressure from Trump, who wants to see a vaccine come on stream or ready to announce before the election
Ed Pilkington in New York
@edpilkington
Sun 30 Aug 2020 21.12 BST
Public health experts have reacted with alarm to remarks by the head of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that he might give the green light for a US Covid-19 vaccine before the normal clinical trial process had reached its conclusion.
As the US was on the verge of 6m coronavirus cases on Sunday, Stephen Hahn, the FDA commissioner, told the Financial Times in an interview published on Sunday that he was prepared to issue emergency use authorization for a Covid-19 vaccine before the end of Phase 3 human trials that put the drug through stringent testing for safety and efficacy.
He said the standard he would apply instead would be “that the benefit outweighs the risk in a public health emergency”.
Hahn told the newspaper that his decision would not be swayed by political pressure amid the febrile atmosphere of the upcoming US presidential election. “This is going to be a science, medicine, data decision. This is not going to be a political decision,” he said.
But several public health experts expressed their concern on Sunday about an apparent willingness to consider fast-tracking a vaccine outside what is considered the gold standard testing process.
The FDA has come under intensifying pressure in recent weeks from Donald Trump, who wants to see a vaccine come on stream or ready to announce before the November election, and has a public-private vaccine development funding program underway called Operation Warp Speed.
Trump has openly attacked the FDA, baselessly citing a supposed “deep state” within it of dragging its feet on the vaccine approval process, despite no evidence to support the latest version of a right-wing conspiracy theory that even one of its most enthusiastic, original Trump administration propagators, Steve Bannon, has dismissed.
The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 was approaching 6m in the US by Sunday afternoon, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University, while recorded deaths stand at a catastrophic 182,612 – almost a quarter of all global fatalities.
Over the weekend California became the first state to pass 700,000 confirmed cases.
Since the beginning of the pandemic in January, Trump has consistently downplayed the severity of the crisis and sidelined scientists, including those at the FDA.
Hahn has been criticized for misleading the public about the efficacy of convalescent plasma treatment which takes blood plasma from Covid-19 survivors and injects it into sufferers.
At a White House media launch last week Hahn, standing beside Trump, said the plasma treatment would save 35 lives out of every 100 patients when in fact studies put the figure at 3 to 5 lives. He was forced to apologise.
Scientists and public health specialists were quick to issue warnings about Hahn’s comments about cutting short the vaccine trials.
Dr Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at New York’s Columbia University, said: “We absolutely cannot tolerate or accept an emergency authorization for any Covid-19 vaccine without reliable safety and efficacy data from phase three clinical trials”.
Writing on Twitter, she said it would be unethical to give the go-ahead before the trials had conclusively proved that both the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.
It would place “huge numbers of people at risk for massive potential harm” and would deal “a catastrophic blow to public confidence in both vaccines and the regulatory mechanisms in place”, she wrote.
Eric Topol of the Scripps Translational Research Institute said that it would take many months for the safety of the vaccine to be fully determined at trial, “irrespective of Stephen Hahn’s subservience to Trump… Any shortcuts will imperil the ultimate rollout of the vaccine and lose the public trust for getting immunized, which is already compromised.”
Hahn’s predecessor as head of the FDA, Scott Gottlieb, told CBS’s Face the Nation that “I don’t know what is meant by saying before the phase 3 trials are completed… They are going to wait for these trials to read out before they can make a decision about the efficacy of these vaccines.”
The news earlier this month that Russia had produced a vaccine was greeted with widespread skepticism because it had been approved and was being given to people, including one of Vladimir Putin’s daughters, before phase three trials"

The truth:
1) We don't need glove as many now. US case dropping (although India's case up, but they are too poor to buy as many gloves at high price).
2) Vaccine will only be here early 2021 in Malaysia (although USA will start populating vaccines end of 2020)
3) What to do between the fall of gloves until the rise of vaccines? Budget 2020 for Malaysia with possible GE15 if budget is not approved by parliament. And US presidential election with 2nd Trump administration as a result.

1. If you have substantial position invested in Gloves, you can consider taking 50% profit and ride the balance. This way you can protect your profit and enjoy the potential upside as well without having to run the full risk along the gyrations and volatility.
2. If you do not have a meaningful size in Gloves, you can consider to just continue riding all the way past Bonus issue and into the future quarterly results. This is because your position is small to make a dent in your overall portfolio, there is no harm riding.
3. If you have invested early and sitting on substantial profits (profits you have never experienced in your life), you are contented with the profits and do not want to stomach the risk of gyrations, then please sell all your holdings and enjoy the fruits of your investments."

""A bird in hand is better than 3 in the bushes. Gloves earnings is visible to all as its production capacity increases, Ave Selling Prices go up, Spot Pricing percentage increases, and more cases across the world, what with new mutations. Very conservative after tax profit will be around 700 million for next quarter.
Vaccines are still not out yet. Malaysia only involved in re packing and at most maybe can cover half of the 32 m population. How much profit can the company make ? Malaysian Gloves covers almost 60 % of world population of Covid 19 and other purposes. After Phase 3 trials, earliest middle 2021, how many of us are convinced that it is effective and willing to be vaccinated ? Vaccination may be repeated every two years and all these needs Gloves to be used""
I have no issues holding the Fantastic Four. It's part of my motivation to give back after benefiting so much. Will revisit again in next quarter or next year. If got more cash, just top up. Always use your extra money and never on margin. You will be fine..
Covid-19 vaccine is expected to be available in the first or second quarter of next year. Beside Gloves, I’m also entering Pharma sector is because the sector is
1. defensive & stable with good yield
2. high barriers of entry & monopolistic
3. potential for growth
Vaccine and Gloves tend to hedge each other’s. Vaccine is currently at an early stage just like Gloves early this year when Theresa Kok pledged that we are donating 18 million gloves to China to help them to fight the Coronavirus. Every stock has a life cycle. The trick is to catch them before it explodes and rally like we have seen in the Gloves Fantastic Four..
The reason why this sector became hot recently is beyond my expectations. It is not like the vaccine is ready tomorrow or next month. However, from what I read sector has already moved in US, China, Hong Kong, South Korea markets. Hence it is a good to invest in this sector before the market took notice.
Unlike the Gloves which produce for the world market, our Phama sector will not benefit high profit margin since they just distribute the vaccine and not producing it. Besides, Malaysia has a small population. Hence both of these companies will not be bigger in term of revenue like the Gloves Fantastic Four. Hence Mabel will just limit to only one Vaccine company in my collection of 11 HealthCare companies.
Always stay invested!

综合媒体报导，俄罗斯正研发多款疫苗，其中由莫斯科“加马列亚”流行病与微生物学研究所研发的一款疫苗，目前处于后期研发阶段，且已向当局申请注册。
曼图罗夫于当地时间周一称：“我们预计于9月开始量产，每月可生产数十万剂，最终在明年初起增至每月数百万剂”。这款疫苗属“病毒载体疫苗”，是利用其他病毒携带脱氧核糖核酸（DNA），借此引发细胞的免疫反应。
据报，上述疫苗测试是由俄罗斯直接投资基金（RDIF）所资助，其首席执行员德米特里耶夫表示，预计疫苗可于10天内完成注册，“若然成事，我们将是全球首款注册的新冠肺炎疫苗，早于美国及其他国家”。
而另一款由位于西伯利亚的国家病毒学和生物技术研究中心研发的疫苗，正进行临床测试，另有两款疫苗将于未来两个月内进行人体测试。"

When offered the vaccine in early August, he started consulting with experts.
""I am not a vaccine specialist,"" he admits, ""So, I called the doctors who deal with vaccinations, I called immunologists. They said, 'don't do it, by no means, the vaccine is raw.'""
It was a friendly offer, he says, no pressure, no obligations. But no matter how hard the deputy chief physician tried to persuade the surgeon that the vaccine is ""perfectly normal, good, amazing,"" the doctor still was reluctant to try it on himself."

A trial is a trial— AstraZeneca pauses coronavirus vaccine trial after unexplained illness in volunteer. Drug giant AstraZeneca said Tuesday it had paused a trial of its coronavirus vaccine because of an unexplained illness in one of the volunteers.
It’s a standard precaution in vaccine trials, meant to ensure experimental vaccines don’t cause serious reactions among volunteers.
“As part of the ongoing randomized, controlled global trials of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine, our standard review process triggered a pause to vaccination to allow review of safety data,” the company said in a statement sent to CNN.
“This is a routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials, while it is investigated, ensuring we maintain the integrity of the trials,” the statement added."

Gloves are the bulls getting mauled now. I earned 7 mil from Hartalega during the peak last month. Now down to 4.3 mil but still happy to exit and pocket the profit instead of seeing it evaporate daily.
2) Unwinding happening. Comfort reported good results yet sold down. Everybody expecting Topglove to earn record profit but shares sold down. Supermax will earn more too but also sold down. Kossan dropping until no eye see despite Bonus Issue. Harta own boss buying shares weekly yet price dropped from RM21 to now RM13. It will feed into a downward selling loop until a new base is found but nobody know when this will happen. Those who bought high will get hurt badly.
3) China will take the opportunity to promote its vaccine now to shake US citizen confidence in Trump policy. Trump will retaliate and speed up emergency vaccine use. Glove companies will get whacked by all these politiced vaccine news flow.
4) UBS Swiss Bank billionaire customers are exiting equities and moving money into physical assets. Follow the big sharks to swim away. They already saw the correction coming.
5) Warren Buffett sold bank and airline stocks and moved money into gold and parking money in Japan. Great depression coming?
I'm out and on standby now for bottom fishing instead of seeing them drop daily. Will get back into glove but seriously I don't see the light out yet. Be safe and don't lose your capital. Cheers"

Now the index going downwards has a lot to do with self-inflicted damages done by incompetent ""market experts / commentators"" making ludicrous reports, expressing unfounded viewpoints and statements in the media or in their advisory note to clients. JF Apex used wrong data and assumptions when they chose to publish a report downgrading the Glove sector. Ex: when they cited vaccine potential approvals in US & reduction in Covid-19 infection in US, they failed to understand hospitals no longer report directly on Covid-19 infection rate to CDC due to Trump order and reduced testings. The same happen with AmInvest producing self inflicting incompetent reports. Hence always take analyst data with a handful of salt.
This week, I have used this opportunity to accumulate the Fantastic Four. Current Price is too good to ignore. Focus on 3 things.
1. Whenever possible, only Buy Mother Shares. Gloves is fundamentally strong. Don't risk your money on call warrant which will benefits the IBs.
2. Only use extra cash. No margin calls
3. Focus on the end result with patience

1) Covid19 is there, its far far from being over.
2) Winter is coming, covid19 is getting worse, and remember this is the first winter human have with covid19.
3) Vaccine is still a long way to go. Even vaccine is considered as antidote to glove markets, sooner or later the vaccine will prove theres even higher surge of glove demands for mass vaccination.
4) This is not economy crisis. The drop of glove stocks is temporary before it rebound. Those familiar with how the big companies function knows the surge and drop of stock are actually manipulated by the mother companies. They bought a lot to create an upward trend so more people would pump in their money, when it reach a peak, the companies have to sell to get more cash, in this scenario to build more production lines for the global crazy demand of gloves, thus causing a crash in stock price. Once the stock price reach a new low, the companies could buy at cheaper price to create another uptrend so you and me will follow to pump in our money, then the cycles continue again.
The CEOS of big 4 and small 3 gloves companies come to an agreement in their whatsapp group of how to manipulate the stock price.

KUALA LUMPUR: CGS-CIMB Equities Research reiterates its Overweight call on the glove sector as concerns of potential declines in average selling prices (ASPs) from CY21F onwards are premature at this juncture.
The research house said signs are showing that ASPs may stay elevated for a longer period (up to end-CY21F).
“Despite its bright prospects, the Malaysian glove sector is trading attractively at 16.7 times CY21F P/E, a 24.3% discount to its five-year mean P/E of 22.1 times.
“In our view, this has largely priced in concerns of a potential windfall tax and discovery of a Covid-19 vaccine, ” it said.
Commenting on the order visibility of glove makers, the research house expected it to be robust up to at least end-1HCY21F, a testament to the current strong global glove demand.
“In our view, the acute global shortage of gloves is likely to worsen as Covid-19 cases worldwide show no signs of slowing down.
“Note that many developed markets (with high glove usage per capita), such as the US and UK, have continued to record new highs in daily Covid-19 cases, ” it said.
CGS-CIMB Research expects the situation to worsen as more western countries head towards the wintering period in 4Q20, which could lead to further spikes in Covid-19 cases.
In term of ASPs, glove makers are expecting further hikes up to at least 1QCY21F. This is on the basis of the recent increase in raw material prices as well as the acute global shortage of gloves.
“Based on our estimates, glove ASPs could rise by 10%-45% quarter-on-quarter in 4QCY20F to US$50-US$100 per 1,000 pieces, which is above our current forecasts.
“However, we gather that certain glove buyers are willing to offer fixed ASPs (at a substantial premium to current ASPs) with a minimum one-year contract tenure to secure glove supply.
“In our view, this should provide certainties of ASPs for CY21F if glove makers agree to these contracts, ” it said.
On the potential windfall tax, glove makers and Malaysia Rubber Glove Manufacturer Association (MARGMA) indicate that there has been no engagement with the government on this matter.
CGS-CIMB Research said in its view, the implementation of a windfall tax on the glove sector would have long-term negative implication as this will drive glove makers to countries with more conducive environments (e.g. labour, tax incentives, utilities, etc).
Glove stocks have been sold down with the recent newsflow on Covid-19 vaccine development.
However, it thinks the eradication of the virus may take a while longer, given that: i) no Covid-19 vaccine candidates have passed Stage 3 and 4 of clinical trials, ii) current limited production capacity may hamper mass availability, and iii) potential mutations of the virus.
Also, it believes that glove demand is unlikely to taper off even with a vaccine, as glove use will in fact increase when masses rush to be vaccinated."

Whether volunteer received potential vaccine or placebo remains unknown, says clinical trial team leader

Indonesia: Chinese vaccine trial volunteer gets virus
JAKARTA
A clinical trial volunteer for a Chinese COVID-19 vaccine candidate in Indonesia tested positive for the virus, said the trial team leader on Friday.
The vaccine is developed by a Chinese company, Sinovac Biotech, and imported to the country by the state-owned Bio Farma.
Kusnandi Rusmil, the head of the trial and research team from Padjadjaran University, said in a statement that the infected volunteer has been put in isolation under strict supervision.
""After nine days, the volunteer’s condition seems to be good,"" said Rusmil, without specifying the volunteer’s gender.
He said the volunteer, after receiving the first injection for the trial, traveled out of town.
“The volunteer was declared healthy upon returning from the trip and then received the second injection,” said Rusmil.
However, he added, due to their travel history, the volunteer was required to take COVID-19 test by the local health authority and tested positive for the virus.
Rusmil said he was unable to confirm whether the volunteer was injected with a potential vaccine or a placebo.
“As we conduct the trials under blind observer principle, we cannot identify who gets the vaccine and who gets the placebo,” he added.
Volunteers who were injected with placebo would be compared to those who were injected with the potential vaccine to determine its capability to build immunity.
Rusmil went on to say that the volunteers’ immunity against the virus would be formed after the second injection.
""Clinical trial volunteers will still have their health monitored for six months after the last injection,"" he said.
The team is conducting Phase 3 of the clinical trials, which started in early August to last six months.
At least 450 volunteers have been injected with a potential vaccine or placebo."

Perhaps having a Bonus issues may not be a good things after all. I'm glad that Hartalega did not do a Bonus Issues.
The revenue is still the same when MQ Research House do their two contradict TP over a period of two months. The only differences is the Bonus Issues by Top Gloves and Supermax that create an opportunities for MQ, JF Apex and AmInvest to downgrade their TP.
Perhaps, if there is no Bonus Issues by these 3 Giants (Kossan included too), Gloves counters could have rocket to the next level. There is always a risk when you change the specification of an F1 cars when it's already running on Top Speed.

Dialling back to the basics
Diving into sustainable fair values following two bumper years
Recent volatility in sector share prices despite no change in fundamentals has led us to question if investors are now looking beyond two years of stellar earnings growth. Valuations are undoubtedly attractive across glove-makers, in our view, at single-digit PEs pegged to peak 12-month forward earnings, further backed by c.5%-9% dividend yields. However, we aim to provide a yardstick for investors by capturing both the value of the short-term boom period coupled with the long-term value from higher, sustainable earnings. This exercise still yields upside potential for glove stocks from current share prices, further affirming our Overweight stance on the sector.
Tying in our base case and timeline
>The mass availability of an effective Covid-19 vaccine, especially in the glove-makers key US market, will ndeniably spell the end of the sector’s hyper-normal era.
>Our base case assumes a mass vaccination by mid-2021, and that the vaccination process coupled with restocking activity will sustain utilisation rates.
>Our near-term ASPs therefore continue to price-in an uptrend up until mid-2021 where we expect price-leader, Top Glove’s ASPs to converge with that of peers Hartalega and Kossan. We subsequently expect the three glove makers to see the gradual normalization of their ASPs at c.US$50/1,000 pcs for nitrile gloves by end-2021.
>The key risk to our base case is potential oversupply from new entrants, although see this as unlikely given constraints in synthetic latex raw materials, whereby we estimate the global raw material supply to just be sufficient to meet the current demand of the major glove players (Figure 5).
End-users will likely be conditioned-to higher ASPs in two years
>A major conundrum amongst investors is on where ASPs will land post-demand normalisation which we expect to be in mid-2022.
>We take the view price stickiness will lead to longer-term nitrile ASPs of c.US$30/1,000pcs, and latex ASPs to average at US$22/1,000 pcs. This translates to a 35%/15% higher sustainable increase versus pre-Covid-19 levels.
>Inelastic glove demand coupled with a limited number of players controlling the lion’s share of global glove capacity are prime factors for higher sustainable ASPs. After 2-3 years of hyper-normal ASPs, end-users will have been conditioned for high ASPs, in our view, while there is limited incentive for manufacturers or distributors to lower the prices in quick succession due to inelastic demand.
Valuing the short-term boom while considering the longer-term earnings base
>The glove mania has split investors along two camps with one arguing it is unreasonable for the sector trades at single-to-low double-digit forward 12-month multiples while the second argues it is unrealistic to pay a mean multiple on peak forward earnings which are unsustainable. Both views have merits.
>With market expectations of supernormal profits increasingly being priced-in, it is necessary to value the sector from the perspective of a long-term strategic investor, where we still see significant value being derived on a medium-term horizon.
>Our revised valuation methodology discounts at the cost of equity the FCFE during the boom period (FY20-23) and the target market cap at the end of the boom period by employing a target PE multiple on sustainable earnings and ASPs.
Maintain BUY ratings post-earnings revisions and valuation methodology changes
>Hartalega: We forecast FY21/22/23 (Mar) NP of RM3.1/RM4.7/RM2.0bn (+5.6x/+50%/-56% YoY). We lower our target price from RM25 to RM20 implying an FY22CL PE of 15x and a 21CL yield of c.7%.
>Top Glove: We forecast FY20/21/22 (Aug) NP at RM1.8/RM11.2/RM4.2bn (+64%/+5.2x/-63% YoY). We lift our target price from RM9.33 to RM10.00 (bonus adjusted), implying a FY21CL PE of 7x and a 21CL yield of 9%.
>Kossan Rubber: We forecast FY20/21/22 (Dec) NP of RM758m/RM2.5bn/RM830m (+2.4x/+2.3x/-67% YoY). We lower our target price from RM17.40 to RM16.10 implying a

Warren Buffet didn’t save Lehman Brothers after assessing their books which contained too many toxic assets. But he did go in big to others like Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs etc. He advocated “Buy America”. He believes in US’s resiliency and ability for the US financial markets to remain world leader despite the mess they caused.
I am going by the same playbook. I advocate “Buy Malaysia”. The Glove sector is one of the few things as a Malaysian we should be proud of. I believe this sector has shown its ability to defy adversity, rise against odds to become a global leader. This is one of the few sectors that Malaysia will remain a global leader post Covid-19 and for many years to come.

The world’s largest nitrile glove maker says the consumption of gloves worldwide will continue to increase because of changes in user behaviour.
Speaking at a press conference after the group’s AGM yesterday, Hartalega CEO Kuan Mun Leong said the Covid-19 pandemic has changed user behaviour, and that was driving up demand for gloves.
“Demand in developed countries has increased 30%, while in developing countries, demand has more than doubled, ” Mun Leong said.
Due to heightened hygiene and safety awareness, there is now a structural step-up in the use of gloves, he said, adding that this was why the medium-term outlook for glove demand would remain strong.
The industry, he said, was currently facing a huge shortage, with about 120 billion pieces of gloves as additional demand.
“This demand can only be fulfilled in three years, ” Mun Leong said, adding that the industry would not see an oversupply in the next three to four years despite players actively ramping up their production capacities.
Mun Leong pointed out that without the pandemic, global demand for gloves typically expanded at an average of 8%-10% per year.
Meanwhile, Hartalega executive chairman Kuan Kam Hon said the company was constantly expanding at an average rate of about 20% per annum, which was slightly more than the organic growth in the industry.
“For us, the situation for the next three years is that of supply not meeting demand, ” Kam Hon said.
“Even if we have extra gloves by the fourth year, it goes into inventory building. When you have a supply shortage, you are not able to build inventory, ” he added.
On capacity expansion, Mun Leong said Hartalega was currently accelerating growth through its next generation glove manufacturing complex (NGC) to to meet the demand.
“To date, we have commissioned 10 out of 12 production lines for plant six, while for plant seven, the first production line is on-track for completion by October 2020, ” Mun Leong said.
The group recently acquired a 24.23ha land in Sepang, Selangor, adjacent to its NGC plant seven, for RM158mil.
The group plans to build four new plants on that piece of land with an investment of RM1.5bil.
“The first line will start production in October 2021, ” Mun Leong said.
Upon completion, the four new plants would add 19 billion pieces per annum in installed capacity.
In addition, Hartalega is expected to invest RM3bil for its next expansion phase, code-named NGC 2.0 to build seven factories on a 38ha in Banting, Selangor. The first production line is expected to be commissioned in the first half of 2022.
Mun Leong said once fully completed by 2027, Hartalega’s expansion plans would see the group’s total annual installed capacity increase to 95 billion pieces per annum.
Hartalega’s net profit more than doubled to a record RM219.7mil for the first quarter ended June 30,2020, while revenue jumped 44% year-on-year to RM920.1mil.
Mun Leong said Hartalega is expected to continue posting better results in the quarters ahead, supported by rising average selling prices due to strong global demand for gloves.
Glove prices, he said, are now three times as high as they were in pre-Covid-19 days.
This quarter alone, spot prices for gloves jumped 30%, and he expected them to increase 40%-50% in next quarter."

Currently all the gloves players are building new production lines to cater to overwhelming demand. It takes 2-3 months to get the production lines going. Therefore, we can expect their quarterly results to keep going up strongly as new lines come online. Please bear in mind that these companies are not going to invest into new production lines if they expect to monetise from it for only a few months.
With or without vaccines, the backlog has to be fulfilled. Therefore no dip in sales volume expected.
Malaysia is lucky to have all the major gloves players. This gives us the opportunity to play. If you invest long term, you should see profits. These are not stocks for speculative play at current price point.
Now the challenge is to decide which company to invest among them. All of these companies have chinaman mentality. Some owners are unscrupulous. You need to bet on the right horse. Good luck everyone. Let's not go down history as Malaysians who failed to make a single sen from gloves boom because there will likely not be a next time."

“Permitted Short Selling (PSS) is not affected by the temporary suspension of short selling, as PSS is necessary for market makers to market make the relevant securities such as exchange traded funds efficiently.” Market maker = IB can shortsell !!! IB short selling to create havoc in the market because of the call warrants issued expiring soon, esp in Oct. Many of them are in bad loss esp those issued with Low premium before April.
The short selling sold 17 Sept must deliver the shares in 2 days time.
Thats called T+2. Those sold today will still buy back tomorrow coz there is such a thing as Express Transfer to deliver shares to you in 2 days time.
Its a gamble, so today will be buy back time for these IBs.
That means the rebound must not more than 64 Sen in order for IB to win big.
If there are a lot of buyers today these Short Sellers will lose. These are the warrants going to be expired.

(ii) C78/Kenanga/8 October

We have to stay united, share this info to the our community to fight against wicked IBs who use many tactics and rumours to shatter the market ... and shortselling are the latest manipulation!
We have to hold on to our shares to win big together. The bosses of glove stocks led by TS Lim WC will lead us too win big as Gloves is the very few stocks that really make profits in this pandemics.
1. Strong earnings visibility for the next 12 months (min) with / without vaccine
2. Shortage is acute especially for nitrile Gloves
3. ASP price increased has been and will remain elevated for some time

5. Monopolistic position of Malaysia supply to the Global markets
6. Valuation is still lagging actual earnings growth and it will be reflected in coming quarters
7. Huge cash inflow for Glove players. Cash is king especially during weak economic environment.
8. No other better sector / industry / stocks for alternative investment opportunities in the near term.
9. Some local funds / local investors may not believe in the Glove sector. But I believe in it strongly. My belief is objective based on data, facts and numbers. Not emotions. There is deep value in Glove sector especially those with strong quality management like Hartalega,, Supermax and Top Glove.
10. Lastly, the Glove sector is very relatable to retail investors who can touch, feel or understand the nature of the business due to usage in daily life."

Now then the current PE is 34. as i have said, do you think the next QR can be double than the recorded PAT of RM 1.29 b ( recent QR )? . if no, then the PE of 34 is not undervalued. However, if the next QR is going to be double or more, then PE 34 is undervalued."

“Permitted Short Selling (PSS) is not affected by the temporary suspension of short selling, as PSS is necessary for market makers to market make the relevant securities such as exchange traded funds efficiently.”
Market maker = IB can shortsell !!! IB short selling to create havoc in the market because of the call warrants issued expiring soon, esp in Oct. Many of them are in bad loss esp those issued with Low premium before April.
The short selling sold 17 Sept must deliver the shares in 2 days time.
Thats called T+2. Those sold today will still buy back tomorrow coz there is such a thing as Express Transfer to deliver shares to you in 2 days time.
Its a gamble, so today will be buy back time for these IBs.
That means the rebound must not more than 64 Sen in order for IB to win big.
If there are a lot of buyers today these Short Sellers will lose. These are the warrants going to be expired.
(i) C77/CIMB /28 September
(ii) C78/Kenanga/8 October
(iii) C80/CIMB /27 October
(iv)C 81/RHB /23 October
(v) C 83/CIMB /27 October
All will cause banks to lose tons of money right esp Maybank c84.
All glove supporters. The call warrants is a big issue now as dirty hand manipulate the market deliberately despite knowing to true value of glove stocks.

How IB can make money if intraday and short term retailer who want to get out by mass end of memoratium. Think again.
If IB up the price the short term retailer will get out. IB also want to make money. Now they slowly collecting slowly and once all the short term retailer went out they will bu in massive.
IB now is very calculative because if they let the price drop so much director will buy back again. If they up the price now the short term retailer will sell by mass before end of memotarium.
So what they do now slowly buy small and small until all the intraday and short term retailer are flush.

A total of 10 COVID-19 vaccines have entered the third phase clinical test involving attempts against humans.
This third phase is most important because it involves volunteers on a larger scale and this phase will also determine the vaccine effective or otherwise.
For example, Johnson & Johnson's company who also entered the race to produce COVID-19 vaccines, will use 60,000 volunteers to test their vaccines named Adenovirus 26 or Ad26.
The mRNA vaccine produced by German, BioNTech companies in cooperation with Pfizer and Phosun Phrlarma from China used 30,000 volunteers for tests in the United States, Brazil, Germany, and then added 43,000 volunteers.
According to the U.S. FDA, one new vaccine produced is considered successful if it can protect 50 % of volunteers from being infected with diseases.
Out of these 10 potential vaccines, five have received early or limited approval even though the third phase test has not been obtained.
Out of the five vaccines, four companies produced from China and one from Russia.
However, experts protest the initial approval given by several countries against vaccines that have not yet passed the third phase.
Russian Pesiden, Vladimir V. Putin had to withdraw the announcement he made that Russia had approved the vaccine, Sputnik V.
After having protested experts who were concerned with side effects, Putin said, the approval that was announced before depends on the third phase test result.
Although it is not known to its effectiveness, several countries have negotiated Russia to get the vaccine between India and Brazil.
UAE and China have reportedly given early approval to two vaccines that are still in the third phase test stage.
UAE has given early approval to vaccines produced by the Wuhan Institute Biological Product funded by Sinopharm company. The vaccine is only for health officers in UAE.
China's military military was reportedly given early approval to get the Ad5 vaccine that gave positive results in the second phase clinical test.
Chinese government reportedly gave emergency approval to vaccines known CoronaVac last July for limited use
While still in phase three clinical test, the vaccine manufacturer company, Sinovac has sealed the deal to supply the vaccine to Indonesia.

Kossan recently issued bonus issue to their shareholders for 1 to 1 basis. Meaning if you have 1 share, you will get 1 more. However, the price will split into half. Which means last week you saw it at rm14 and now is at rm7. Basically are the same price except the 1 lot or 1 share is cheaper now. This in a way will give more opportunities to those investors who want to invest in this company an affordable price to purchase. Hope this helps."

Covid 19 pandemic is affecting everyone’s movement and all businesses with the exception of medical gloves and medical products for the prevention of the virus.

Meow Unker..
Gloves has been a darling to me..
It's all in the family..
Top Glove is like the eldest son in the family, leader of the pack, responsible, and always brilliant..a good problem solver.
Hartalega, is like a young mother. Quiet, full of skills and talent, in fact, very unique and continue to perform when it matters. She inspires her 3 brothers
Kossan is like the confused child in the family, doesn't know what he wants in his life, need to coach, he needs a real good god father to guide him slowly.
Supermax, is the youngest, naughty, restless, annoying and irritating, but when he shows his brilliance and on fires, even his two elder big brother get scared..
Mabel loves them all
Today, Investors are taking profit on the vaccine news. But I believe is a short-term movement since the big four rubber glove counters, collectively, have gained some RM147.42 billion worth of market cap. This is equivalent to 36% of the total market cap increase from all the stocks listed on Bursa Malaysia.
Mabel Gloves Supermax and Kossan are expected to replace Genting Malaysia Bhd (GENM) and Genting Bhd (GENT). Both will join her brother and sister Top Glove and Hartalega in KLCI
Mabel has done research and found that Technology & Healthcare Sectors are currently very strong.
Stay invested..

Gloves going to burst?
Glove supply will not meet demand in next three years

The Big 4 Glove companies can't even meet the demand for the next 3 YEARS.
Meanwhile, hotels will remain closed for years, airlines have nowhere to go to and banks CANNOT lend.
Genting LOST RM786 million in one quarter and will continue to incur losses.
Supermax GAINS RM1 billion (28 Oct QR expected) in one quarter and will continue to grow.
Maybank market cap (80b) is THREE TIMES larger than Supermax (26b) but Supermax defeats Maybank's profits.

Indexs has made a very strong recovery from Sept 10 (3,067) lows, however this recovery can now be slowing down based on 2 interpretations we are observing.
The first one shows a potential flat correction in the making for wave II, after completion an ext 5th wave move for 39-days long, where we are looking now for a three wave a-b-c rebound into wave B even back towards 4,322 levels. We believe this simple zig-zag A-B-C correction would trade between range 3,960 - 4.923 before bullish wave III taken over.
Then we have another wave count #2, that shows a potential top formation in wave 3 of I, where correction for wave 4/I on-going. Support for a wave 4 correction can be at Fib Ratio of 23.6/38.2 that comes in at 4,138/3,992 level so watch that area as potential reversal zone. As such, this wave 5/I could be impulsive to kick in anytime this week, target to retest the highest done 4,322 (August 6, 2020) and beyond.

In June 2020, Top Glove reported their RM350 mil PAT
In September 2020, Top Glove reported their RM1.3 billion PAT which is 3.7 times higher than their own previous quarter.
In August 2020, Supermax reported their RM400 mil PAT. RM50 mil higher than Top Glove.
Next week late-October 2020, Supermax WILL ANNOUNCE their RM1 billion PAT which is 2.5 times higher than their own previous quarter.
Top Glove's market cap is THREE TIMES larger than Supermax.
But Supermax can match Top Glove's profits.
This means that Supermax can hit RM1 billion to 1.5 billion+ in profits EVERY QUARTER for years to come.

Summary :- Despite having the lowest current capacity Supermax has the second highest Profit After Tax at RM0.79Bil much more than Harta and Kossan with higher capacity, Supermax able to achieve due to their highest profit margin at 58.4%! Even more crazy is that Supermax has the biggest capacity increase by 2022 with 85.5% more than current existing capacity compared to others only at 14.7% - 20.5% while at the same time having the most cash out of all big 4 with over RM2bil! Looking at its current market cap at only RM26.6bil , imagine the price it would be if able to double the market cap to RM53.2 bil market cap which is still below Harta current market cap of RM62.7bil! if that happens Supermax price would shoot up to RM19.56 !! which is equivalent to RM39.12 before BI!
Supermax currenly has the lowest PE among glove counters at only PE20 and FPE8. EPS over 30.. can you imagine how undervalue Supermax currently is? if you think its current price is too expensive you must be insane
2 scenarios in 2022 . If ASP continue to increase with almost double capacity increase Supermax PAT would hit over 2billion per quarter easily
if ASP maintain , or drop a little bit due to increase in supply or reduce in demand. lets say ASP drop to same level as previous quarter that gives supermax PAT at RM399mil with the doubled capacity it can easily maintain current PAT of RM789mil for many years to come"

If you compare Kossan and Supermax, Kossan’s current capacity is more than Supermax, but Supermax’s profits are greater. Do you know why? THEIR GLOVES ARE OVERPRICED. They CHARGE their consumers (which would mostly be healthcare providers, by the way) a whole lot more.
Most investors and traders don’t actually know that the quality of the Top 4 Gloves are different. Hartalega is undoubtedly the best quality gloves, but their profits are lower as they don’t rip off their customers by charging ridiculous prices.
Don’t @ me. I support all four glove counters. Just stop the hate. Stop shit talking other glove companies so that the glove company you favour will do better.

Supermax is charging USD and CAD fair and square.

Hate comes in many forms, educate yourself.
Stop promoting Supermax in counters that aren’t even related. Genting, Prolexus, Public Bank, AT, Maybank? That is spam that isn’t welcomed. 480+ Comments in the past week, all regarding Supermax? Are you a super fan or are you getting paid?
Yes, I know the prices. Maybe you should look into it yourself, not just in America and Canada.
Everyone already knows how well Supermax is doing, you don’t need to criticise the directors and company. It is normal to take profit. It is not running away because the profits are ‘too low’. If I were the directors or EPF fund managers, I’d do the same. Traders take profit when the price is high, and buy back when it is low. You can call it running away, but they always run back.

無常（Fickle)春夏秋冬指标意思：運用軟件大數據統計市場的狀況，然後控制自己的資金，我門不能控制股票，不過我們可以控制自己的資金，貪心和害怕！
設計的概念是從易經變化出來，所謂太極生兩儀，兩儀生四象，春夏秋冬代表了四象：全陽，陽中帶陰，陰中帶陽！
春天
是庄家收票的累积
这个时候可以游击赚钱，不贪心
現金比率20-50%
夏天
是庄家要炒作
这个时候要把握机会，不要随便卖出，尽量中线，要贪心，現金比率0%或-150%margin(不鼓勵）
秋天
是多数庄家已高位出票
少数股票继续飞天，概率低，現金比率50%-100%
冬天
冬天下跌丢票，尽头可以累积根据无常价值投资标准和八大法则。現金比率100%，盡頭可以減少到70%然後50%，盡頭通常運用另外一個指標天堂地獄人間的啊修羅地獄判斷買入30%，所謂我不入地獄，誰入地獄？
無常的春夏秋冬代表事物不會永恆不變，而可以複製的招式代表永恆不變，流傳千古，畢竟這些招式懂的運用都會賺錢！
青色代表春天，數據最多時就是春天
紅色代表夏天，數據最多時是夏天
黃色代表秋天，數據最多時代表秋天
藍色代表冬天，數據最多時代表冬天

Fickle's spring, summer, autumn and winter indicators mean: use software big data to count market conditions and then control our own funds. We can't control stocks, but we can control our own funds, greed and fear!
The concept of the design is a change from the I Ching. The so-called two instruments of Tai Chi, the four images of the two instruments, spring, summer, autumn and winter represent the four images: all yang, yang in yang, yang in yin!
spring
Is the accumulation of the dealer's ticket collection
You can guerrilla to make money at this time, not greedy
Cash ratio 20-50%
summer
It's the dealer's hype
At this time, you must seize the opportunity, don't sell it casually, try to be mid-line, be greedy, and the cash ratio is 0% or -150% margin (not encouraged)
fall
Most of the dealers have already voted high
A small number of stocks continue to fly, with a low probability, with a cash ratio of 50% -100%
winter
Falling votes in winter, the end can accumulate according to impermanent value investment standards and the eight rules. The cash ratio is 100%, and the end can be reduced to 70% and then 50%. The end usually uses another indicator, Heaven and Hell. The Asura Hell judges to buy 30%. So-called I do n’t go to hell, who goes to hell?
The impermanence of spring, summer, autumn and winter means that things will not change forever, but the moves that can be copied represent the same forever.
Cyan represents spring, and the most data is spring
Red represents summer, most data is summer
Yellow represents autumn, when the most data is autumn
Blue represents winter, and the most data represents winter"

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001389.jsp?ftp=160","Nov 2, 2020 10:36 PM","Mabel","Windfall tax on gloves is only justifiable when the industry makes huge profits over a longer period (like oil palm) but not just over 6 months during d Covid-19 pandemic. Any windfall tax come just add to the ASP and pass on to customers end consumers which is not a good idea under current economic uncertainty.
Up to mid-October, there have been no consultations between the authorities and industry representatives to discuss the implementation of such a tax. Windfall tax IF include have to wait 6 Nov 2020 during Malaysian budget tabling, but due to politics uncertainty, it maybe not being approve or need longer time to be approve.
Furthermore, unlike a commodity like crude palm oil — where prices are publicly available as the product is generic — there is no standard average selling price (ASP) for gloves, as they come in different types and specifications. For example, gloves can be made from nitrile butadiene or natural latex, each with their own cost structures. Additionally, clients from different industries — e.g. healthcare, pharmaceutical, food, and semiconductors — will also require different glove specifications with a wide range of ASPs.
As an example, if windfall tax approves, at what stage it will be implement?.
1. If on manufacturing, Harta will be effect the most due to more production and all its product manufacture in Malaysia. (Tax for each glove)
2. If on trading, supermax will be the most effect but supermax do most of their trading overseas through their oversea distributor so they can set bigger profit margin or operation cost for their oversea subsidiary then put it on their oversea expansion.
3. If on earning, supermax did not only sell glove but other PPE and contact lens too.. so cannot lump sum all supermax earning are from glove. Again, the most effects is Harta.
Anyway, price of glove sell by each manufacture are not the same, depend on how they negotiate. Is it fair to punish the better negotiator? So how to calculate the windfall tax to make it fair to every company. Then we have new entrant, even before their investment bear fruit, their profit already will be tax. This will discourage investment in glove and halt growth of glove industry in Malaysia.
RHB said the rubber glove industry has been paying corporate taxes and foreign worker levies to the government. In line with the higher profits within this sector, RHB estimate that the tax paid to the government should be at least triple the amount paid during pre-Covid-19 times.
Lastly, imposing a windfall tax may be counter-productive, as it could encourage local glove makers to adjust their future expansion plans overseas to countries like Thailand and China

Have you tried our delicious pineapple? Please try it. It will help your PPB to overcome this prolong period. It's not good to the shareholder who is holding it. It make them grumpy and emotional.
Mabel loves pineapples. It not only shorten Mabel's period. It's also full of Vitamin C which is good for Mabel's lovely white skin...

In a note today, CGS-CIMB said the difficulty is due to a lack of standardised pricing of gloves due to the variety in types, specifications and product grades as well as intended target markets.
Nevertheless, should this happen, it will have negative implications for the sector, particularly for its long-term prospects, it said.
CGS-CIMB maintained ""overweight"" on the rubber glove sector.
The Malaysian government is set to table Budget 2021 on Friday (Nov 6). There have been growing concerns that the government would implement some sort of windfall tax on glove companies to shore up its coffers amid ongoing economic uncertainties.
This is in view of recent ""supernormal"" profits enjoyed by the glove sector, given the surge in both demand and average selling prices (ASPs) of gloves due to the Covid-19 pandemic, CGS-CIMB noted.
“For illustration purposes, we conducted a sensitivity analysis of the potential impact of a higher corporate tax rate. We found that a 5% rise in the corporate tax rate could cut the sector’s 2020 net profit by 6.5% and allow the government to raise an extra RM593 million in taxes for 2020.
""Based on our estimates, glove companies we cover are already slated to pay total corporate income tax of RM2.8 billion and RM4.7 billion for 2020 and 2021 [respectively], based on our forecasts,” it said.
If a windfall tax materialises, CGS-CIMB said it believes Malaysian glove makers may opt to expand overseas.
This could result in potential opportunity loss for the government due to lower future investment by glove players and its spillover benefits, it said."

Mabel Motivation for collecting Serba Dinamik
1. Serba is well run by a Good and Capable CEO
2. It's a company with International Business with 16 Consecutive Quarters Profits.
3. Serba involves in O&M, PECC for O&G, petrochemical, power plant & mega construction projects. It's expanding into AI providing IR 4.0 to its clients. In fact, only 40% out of current book order value of RM18.5 B is from O&G. Very well diversified. FYI, Both Trumps and Bidden has Technology under their policy radar

According to Merriam-Webster, chauvinism entails “an attitude of superiority towards people of the opposite sex.” The dictionary cites “male chauvinism” as the most common example, implicitly making the valid point that chauvinism involves people with privilege and their negative attitudes toward people in less-privileged positions.
As many an ambitious female employee can tell you, chauvinism shows up frequently in the professional world. Particularly if you work in an environment heavily populated by conservative men of an older generation (although certainly not exclusively; young men are just as capable of chauvinism as their elders), the tendency of certain senior staffers to dismiss feedback or advancement requests from female employees runs rampant. But there’s no need to sit back and accept these discriminatory attitudes as a necessary evil; both women and their male and non-binary allies can and should fight back against chauvinistic behaviours.
It seems the above description fits well with this Grumpy Old Man.
Warren Buffet said ""Never invest in a business you cannot understand.”
I suppose everyone have different views in making their respective investments. For me, it is easier if you invest on something that goes in line with the country’s direction and at the same time doing something that will benefits this Country as well as the Global community. I always has this rule of thumb when I made my investments. I do this as it will benefits the people surrounding me and also to the Global Community. 10 years from now as I look back, I want to feel that I was part of these success stories.
Lastly, as long as you follow the Pareto 80/20 Rule and stay invested on something that is closed to your heart, you will be fine.

Scientex for:
(1) the strong prospects of the packaging industry as consumer spending shifts to on-the-go food and beverages due to a hectic lifestyle and higher food safety standards;
(2) a robust property development business despite the soft market in general thanks to its right focus on predominantly landed affordable residential units in secondary suburbs.
(3) The segment also sells plastic automotive interior components.
Unker,
I'm sure Scientex is good. No doubt about that..
Plastic products is not under Mabel's Business Plan. Beside Plastic is not environment friendly..
Mabel already 5 very good Property companies with hugh landbanks

Potential upside for FGV,
1. All cleaning up has been done through the FGV Transformation Plan
2. RM700 million potential right back that will improve FGV Balance Sheet!
3. FGV has both Oil Palm and Rubber which complement my World Class Gloves Fantastic Four collection. Malaysia is
World No 1 Biggest Producers of Gloves
World No 2 Biggest Producers of Palm Oil
World No 3 Biggest Producer of Rubber.
I believe FGV has really something to offer to everyone who has invested in in her.

I'm actually beginning to think this grumpy old man is a gaylord.
You can notice from the way he spit out his frustrations when things don't go his way. When the sharks have bitten him, he will in return become nasty to other forumers, calling names and slandering remarks just because of difference in opinions. It's a sad existent but he has only himself to blame.
Really sad case for This Man from Unker...always get scolded again and again wherever he goes...

06/11/2020 11:50 PM
Thank you BIOALPHA. Yes, it's an opportunity for a capital gain.
My motivation to invest in Plantation:
- Export revenue RM 67.6 billion (6.1% GDP)
- Feeding more than 3 billion people over 200 countries.
- B20 biodiesel for the transport sector by end-2020. Demand to increase palm oil by 500,000 tonnes per annum. Indonesia Petromina has mandated the use 3 million tons per annum and they are short of capacity.
- The demand for palm oil will always grow due to the population and economic growth in China and India, our two most important buyers. In actual fact, the financial situation in USA and Europe have little effect on this business. Which business can give you more than 100% profit margin? Currently collectively my Plantation sectors is giving me 3 digits Profits Margin.
So it doesn't matter which plantation you choose, you will still contribute to the above milestone.

The data presented is not the final analysis. It is based on the first 94 volunteers to develop Covid - the precise effectiveness of the vaccine may change when the full results are analysed.
Pfizer and BioNTech say they will have enough safety data by the third week of November to take their vaccine to regulators. Until then it is not possible for countries to begin their vaccination campaigns. It is a relief... there is a long long way to go before vaccines will start to make a real difference, but this feels to me like a watershed moment."

KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 10): While the world is celebrating Pfizer’s overnight announcement of a viable Covid-19 vaccine candidate, rubber glove stocks may not be part of the party.
Glove counters top the loser list after the morning bell today.
As at 10.20am, shares in rubber glove counters were among the top losers on Bursa Malaysia. Hartalega Holdings Bhd slid by 8.54% or RM1.54 to RM16.60, making it the top value loser on Bursa, followed by Supermax Corp Bhd, down 75 sen or 7.79% to RM8.88.
In the third place was Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd, which released a strong set of quarterly earnings yesterday, dropping 63 sen or 8.27% to RM6.88, valuing it at RM17.59 billion.
Top Glove Corp Bhd took the fifth place, falling 54 sen or 6.37% to RM7.94.
The smaller players were not spared from the selling pressure. Comfort Gloves Bhd fell 31 sen or 6.97% to RM4.14, Careplus Group Bhd shed 27 sen or 7.8% to RM3.19, and Rubberex Corp (M) Bhd lost 16 sen or 6.45% to RM2.32.
The Healthcare Index was dragged down by the glove stocks, declining by 1.78% or 73.47 points to 4,048.89.
Still, while there was a selldown across the rubber glove stocks, shares in companies tapped by the government to bottle and distribute a potential Covid-19 vaccine were rising.
In a note this morning, AmInvestment Bank Research reiterated its view that the market will continue to shift to predominantly pandemic-themed plays to a recovery-focused theme in December.
“We have been advocating for investors to lighten their positions in the 'pandemic play', i.e. glove stocks, and replace them with the 'recovery play'.
“With the latest positive news coming in a rather abrupt manner, we expect volatility as investors of glove stocks rush to the exit at the same time. The two FBM KLCI-weighted glove stocks, i.e. Top Glove and Hartalega, command a combined weighting of 13% to 14%,” AmInvestment Bank wrote in the strategy note.
Having downgraded the glove sector to ""neutral"" on Aug 25, 2020 from ""overweight"" on positive news of a vaccine, AmInvestment Bank was putting fair values (FVs) for glove stocks under its coverage under review with negative bias.
Still, it expects gains linked to recovery plays to be significantly offset by losses seen in pandemic plays, resulting in it maintaining its end-2020 KLCI target of 1,530 points despite the overwhelming good news.
To recap, Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced last night that their experimental Covid-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective with no serious safety concerns based on initial trial results, estimating that they can roll out up to 50 million doses this year for 25 million people and produce 1.3 billion doses in 2021."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001389.jsp?ftp=163","Nov 10, 2020 12:04 PM","Mabel","Pfizer said that its experimental coronavirus vaccine was found to help prevent COVID-19.
Still, the data hasn't been published in a peer-reviewed journal, and regulators haven't reviewed the vaccine.
Supplies of the vaccine are limited. If the vaccine is approved, it could take months for you to get it.
The peak for Glove price has yet to come. Lock your profits if you have to. But don't sell all and by all means, avoid CWs. There already too many CWs. You may think you spotted a good deal and other investors are dumb to buy mother share instead of warrant. Just wait till IB press down the price and you lose all money in the CW. You will know who is dumb in the end. We already seen this happen recently. Learn from that mistake.

Moderna said the information is being prepared for submission to the trial's independent data safety monitoring board, which will look at the results and make a recommendation. It did not say when it plans to release the efficacy data.
The company said in a news release that it has seen a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases among trial participants as infection rates have surged around the United States.
Due to the spike in cases, the analysis will cover substantially more than 53 infections, which had been the targeted trigger point for the first analysis.
The company said the trial remains blinded, so neither it nor study investigators know which participants received the vaccine or a placebo. The vaccine will be deemed a success if the overwhelming majority of those infected had received a placebo, once the monitoring board looks at the early results.
Earlier in the day, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, said Moderna could have the data from anywhere between ""a couple of days"" to ""a little more than a week.""
A high degree of effectiveness would make sense as it is ""almost identical"" to Pfizer Inc's experimental vaccine, Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at a conference organized by the Financial Times.
""It may not be 95%, it might be 90%, or 96%, or 89%, but it is going to be up there,"" he said.
Pfizer on Monday said its COVID-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective based on interim trial results, significantly higher than the at least 50% efficacy regulators are looking for.
Moderna, which uses a similar messenger RNA technology as Pfizer, said earlier on Wednesday that its November timeline for initial data was on track.
It did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on when it would disclose the data.
The company would still have to wait for two-month follow-up safety data required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which it expects to have in the second half of this month, before applying for U.S. emergency use authorization.
There are no vaccines that have gained global approval yet, although a handful, including Moderna's, are in late-stage studies.
Moderna's shares closed up 8.4% at $82.44 and rose to $83.85 in extended trading
Another vaccine results coming out soon. Beware to all glove lover and shareholders."

KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 12): AmInvestment Bank believes that while glove demand will stay stable post-Covid-19 pandemic, average selling prices (ASPs) will drop as there will no longer be a rush for gloves.
We reckon that ASP will stabilise at a higher level than pre-pandemic level due to the broader usage of gloves,” it said in a note on Top Glove Corp Bhd today.
The research house’s analyst Thong Pak Leng said it believed that glove demand will remain strong, based on reasons outlined by Top Glove during a webinar, which include a higher awareness of personal hygiene and broader use of gloves beyond the healthcare sector.
In addition, Thong said there may not be an oversupply of gloves after the pandemic, as Top Glove had pointed out that there are key issues in ramping up supply that need to be addressed, including the availability of contractors to build production lines, the shortage of foreign workers and constraint of nitrile raw material.
Top Glove has also allocated 30% of its capacity for spot orders. “The spot orders for nitrile glove have been fully sold for the next three months. Meanwhile, the spot orders for natural rubber powder-free gloves are also increasing due to the long lead time of nitrile gloves,” said Thong.
Presently, Top Glove has a total production capacity of 90 billion pieces per annum.
To expand further, Top Glove has allocated capital expenditure of RM10 billion over the next five years for capacity expansion to double its current capacity by the end of 2025, said Thong. This will be done in stages whereby 14 billion pieces will be added for FY21 and 16 billion for FY22.
AmInvestment Bank maintains its ""hold"" call on the stock with a lower fair value of RM7.88, adding that the group’s fundamentals remain solid for the next few years.
“We maintain our view that Top Glove’s net profit will peak in FY21 as demand soars from the Covid-19 pandemic with increased capacity expansions. We make no changes to our FY21–FY23 net profit forecasts at RM6.5 billion, RM2.3 billion and RM2.2 billion respectively.
“Our ASP assumptions are US$60 per 1,000 pieces for FY21, US$35 per 1,000 pieces for FY22 and US$28 per 1,000 pieces for FY23 with an average utilisation rate of more than 80%,” said Thong.
Top Glove is currently fourth on Bursa’s top losers list, having fallen 19 sen or 2.42% to RM7.67. The stock is currently valued at RM62.34 billion."

Govt to ‘regularise’ undocumented foreign workers, subject to conditions
FMT Reporters -November 12, 2020 1:21 PM
PETALING JAYA: The government will implement a plan to “regularlise” undocumented migrant workers so they they can become legalised foreign workers subject to certain conditions.
Home Minister Hamzah Zainudin said that under the programme, known as the Undocumented Migrant Recalibration Plan, undocumented migrants will also be allowed to return home voluntarily.
He said the plan, to come into effect from Monday until June 30, 2021, is to address the undocumented migrants issue.
“This plan will be implemented by the Immigration Department and the Department of Labour of Peninsular Malaysia and other government agencies without the involvement of third parties and vendors,” he said at a press conference today.

KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 16): Glove stocks were headed lower in Bursa Malaysia's morning trading session today due to the news flow of Covid-19 vaccine progress, which dampened sentiment on the counters.
As at the time of writing, glove stocks were among the top losers today. At 11.53am, Hartalega Holdings Bhd, being the second top loser, was down 4.29% or 66 sen at RM14.72, bringing its market capitalisation lower to RM50.54 billion. It saw some 2.78 million shares traded.
In the fourth place was Supermax Corp Bhd, which fell 5.24% or 46 sen to RM8.32, with a market value of RM22.72 billion.
More than seven months after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Covid-19 outbreak in China a “public health emergency of international concern”, the global economy continues to reel from the impact of the virus.
Meanwhile, Top Glove Corp Bhd, which bought back 8.94 million or 0.72% of its shares for RM69.9 million in the open market last Friday, dropped 3.98% or 31 sen to RM7.47, valuing the stock at RM61.47 billion. The counter was the seventh biggest loser as at the time of writing.
The smaller players were also not spared from the selling pressure. Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd lost 4.2% or 28 sen to RM6.38, Careplus Group Bhd fell 6.58% or 20 sen to RM2.84, and Comfort Gloves Bhd shed 4.71% or 19 sen to RM3.84.
The Healthcare Index was dragged down by the glove stocks, declining by 1.75% or 69.68 points to 3,921.47.
Last week, Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced that their experimental Covid-19 vaccine was more than 90% effective with no serious safety concerns based on initial trial results.
They also estimated that they can roll out up to 50 million doses this year for 25 million people and produce 1.3 billion doses in 2021."

KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 16): The government has communicated with 10 Covid-19 vaccine producers following a notification by the World Health Organization (WHO) that there are 11 Covid-19 vaccine candidates in phase 3 clinical trial (as of Nov 13).
Science, Technology and Innovation Minister Khairy Jamaluddin said communications with eight of the producers was made directly, while the other two was through the Covid-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX).
He said some of the discussions are in the final stage and an official announcement would be made when everything has been finalised.
“The discussion covers aspects of cooperation in various stages of vaccine development such as R&D (research and development), exchange of scientists, fill and finish development (transfer of technology, logistics, cold chain), including the purchase of vaccines (finished products) as a guarantee of access to vaccine supply for the country,"" he said during the questions for oral answers session in the Dewan Rakyat today.
He was responding to a question from Chan Foong Hin (Pakatan Harapan-Kota Kinabalu) who wanted to know whether the ministry had made any order to import vaccines from companies from China, such as Cansino, Sinovac and Sinopharm, or the UK, such as AstraZeneca, and whether the ministry would set the order of priority for Covid-19 vaccination as being done in Indonesia.
Khairy said through participation in COVAX, Malaysia would have access to the supply of Covid-19 vaccine of 10% of the country's population and the government was working to get another 60% to meet the national immunisation target for herd immunity to up to 70 per cent of the country's population.
The government, he said, was also working to get vaccine access as early as the first or second quarter of next year depending on the approval from the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA).
He said the NPRA will ensure that a vaccine passes the stipulated strict conditions, covering its safety and effectiveness through data on the clinical trial that was conducted.
Meanwhile, on the list of immunisation priorities, Khairy said the Special Committee on Covid-19 Vaccine Supply Access (JKJAV), set up on Oct 14 , had agreed to divide it into three groups, namely the frontliners, involving staff of the Ministry of Health (MoH) and agencies not under the MoH, such as the police, the Malaysian Armed Forces, Immigration Department and others, in the first group.
The second is for high-risk groups, such as individuals with co-morbid and seniors citizens, and the third involves other adult population.
Details of the groups are being made and the announcement is expected to be made during the first quarter of next year."

Just as worldwide shortages of masks and disinfectant gels have pushed up the prices of those products, single-use medical gloves have become increasingly difficult and costly to come by during the health crisis and this effect is multiplied with closure of the largest Top Glove factory due to EMCO.
Malaysian manufacturer Top Glove, which describes itself as the world's biggest producer of rubber gloves, said it is seeing orders for 24-30 billion a month, compared with 4.5 billion prior to the pandemic has complied to government’s order.
Top Gloves is the world's biggest maker of rubber gloves, accounting for around 25 per cent of global exports. And according to the Malaysian manufacturers' association MARGMA, worldwide demand is projected to rise from 330 billion in 2020 to 590 billion in 2021 due to mass vaccination campaign. With the closure of largest factory and rising demand, given the surge, the industry is forecasting a massive shortage of gloves that is expected to last well into 2023 and ASP will increase 3 folds to 70% month (current 25%) on month basis, MARGMA said.

He said several glove companies had raked in billions of ringgit this year following high global demand due to the pandemic.
He added that they should be subjected to a windfall tax which could be channelled to the purchase of Covid-19 vaccines and to assist frontliners.
“My proposal is for the government to introduce a windfall tax on rubber glove companies in Malaysia that have enjoyed extraordinary profits in the Covid-19 season.
“We do not want to punish the companies but they have raked in extraordinary profits when others are suffering, ” he said while debating Budget 2021 in the Dewan Rakyat here on Wednesday (Nov 18).
Syed Saddiq said the government should be brave enough to introduce a fair taxation system for the benefit of the people.
“Do not let the rich become richer and the poor remain poor, ” he said.
The former youth and sports minister said the government had received RM400mil in the form of items donated by these companies.
During the tabling of Budget 2021, Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz said the contribution would help to cover the cost of Covid-19 vaccines as well as health equipment expenses."

Fresh from CNN———
Any respiratory viruses are trickier. People can catch COVID over and over again, just like catching a cold, and flu vaccines generally provide only partial protection against infection and severe disease. Part of that's due to flu's tendency to mutate. Coronaviruses seem to fall in this category. There are seven known coronaviruses that can infect people and SARS-CoV-2 is just one of them. Many human coronaviruses can cause the common cold, but because they are not usually deadly, they are not as well studied."

It means the supply of Topglove gloves may drop by 1/4 from this factory. Gloves has many factories. This is an opportunity for her siblings... other glove manufacturers like Kossan, Supermax, Hartalega to regain position..
Lately EPF has been collecting all these Fantastic Four Gloves shares when it retrace due to many bad news.
As a shareholders we need to understand why we are buying these Gloves shares?
First no one predict correctly when the pandemic will end as per earlier posting. The fact still remains that these companies that we own produces one of the most sought after product in battling this pandemic. Its the World's Best. Even China is not even close to these Fantastic Four. They all are paying premium taxes to our government plus additional 500 million donations to help Budget 2021. So it's a very good sector to be in.
So the next question you may ask is when to sell?
When people stop wearing masks, you don't need temperature taken before going into malls. When temperature reader is taken off at the airport.
That's when you can start selling some of your holdings. With or without vaccine or Convid 19, Gloves will always be in demand by the Health Industry..
Don't time the market. Research has shown that 90 % of the traders lose money. Only sell when Gloves is on the break out. Every stocks has a life cycle, so is Gloves despite having a very strong fundamentals . Gloves will peak next year. Trade if you must to cut your losses or take profits but don't sell all..

1. Vaccine may be ready only by early next year and it will only be given to frontliner + high risk group (old age).
2. Worldwide vaccination campaign will not begin before Mid 2021 and when world vaccination campaign is starting the order of glove will be increase as healthcare workers need to replace every glove for each vaccination to ensure safety of people and each persons may need to take 2 shots of vaccine.
So at least may be up to billion of gloves will be required throughout the whole campaign to progress until 2022."

Questions that can’t be answered due to time constraints will be answered in writing,” a government source familiar with the scheduled budget vote told The Edge, adding that at present, the budget voting is still “confirmed” for tomorrow as scheduled.

Personal protective equipment (PPE) stockpiles in England were inadequate for the Covid pandemic and price rises earlier this year cost taxpayers about £10bn, the spending watchdog has said.
The National Audit Office said there had been a particular shortage of gloves and aprons.
The government said the NAO's report recognised that NHS providers had been able to get what they needed in time. Almost £12.5bn was spent on 32bn items of PPE between February and July 2020. During the same period in 2019, 1.3bn items were bought at a cost of £28.9m."

After observing the steep rise in ASP a week go and onwards while the ASP is projected to skyrocket to a new level, our assumptions, we project Nov’20 ASP to increase by 50% and 60% in the following month before decreasing to 20% in FY21.
This is based on the assumption of a significant growth in ASP due to unprecedented closure of a leading glove manufacturer, Top Gloves which controls 25% of global market share. The elevated ASP will sustain into the first half of 2022 before moderating in FY23.
The earnings upside to the FY20 estimates would be high if Top gloves factories remain close for another week, which would suggest that the non- Top gloves counters may continue to rise and the precious FY20 earnings may be underestimated."

Rubber glove stocks under our coverage have gone through share price volatility over the past months on concerns that investors are looking at earnings beyond FY21. Based on our analysis presented in this report, we can conclude that: (i) ASP is going to be stubbornly high at least till mid 2022 which supports exponential QoQ earnings growth over the next few quarters, (ii) tight supply situation due to unprecedented closure of Top Glove factories following nitrile raw material and glove formers shortage will lead to longer production lead time, and (iii) 2020 to 2022 estimated incoming capacity are indicating demand to continue outpacing supply. All in, we are excited with the sector prospects over the next few quarters due to supply tightness amid strong demand. Specifically, industry trend of rising weekly and monthly ASPs is expected to boost bottom-lines. Amplifying the growth are restocking and inventory-building activities creating a supernormal demand spurt leading to acute supply shortage, due to the prolonged pandemic."

Recent data suggests people who were once infected with the coronavirus could be infected again as their antibody response wanes, Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization’s health emergencies program, said during a press briefing.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some Covid-19 reinfections are expected based on the agency’s prior experience with similar viruses. In late August, researchers in Hong Kong reported what appeared to be the first confirmed case of Covid reinfection. While rare, the WHO said at the time that reinfection could be possible.
Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the WHO’s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, said that researchers are still trying to determine how long an antibody response lasts after someone is naturally infected with the virus.
“In some people, it may wane after a few months but we do get a good indication that natural infection immune response is lasting for some months,” Van Kerkhove said."

There is no quick way to determine how long immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus will last, and researchers will need to monitor this closely in the coming months and years.
There have been some reports of reinfection and falling antibody levels months after an initial bout of COVID-19, but it is still unclear how prevalent reinfection is. And there are signs that the immune system preserves a memory of coronavirus infection in the form of specialized memory cells that could kick into action rapidly if the virus is encountered again. And vaccines, Altmann says, are deliberately designed to provoke strong responses from the immune system."

Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd economist Adam Mohamed Rahim is also positive of the industry performance in view that demand growth would continue in 2022 as awareness towards health and personal hygiene are likely to remain prevalent as the general society is embracing the new normal.
“Therefore, demand for personal protective equipment, including gloves would help drive demand post-Covid-19. Expansion plans for major rubber glove makers are so far on track.

...
For next year at least, I believe the worst-case is that the demand plateaus. With these gloves companies, their orders are stacked until the end of 2021. That's a very comfortable position to be in. Which is why an investor must have at least one gloves counter in his portfolio. And the price correction yesterday had provided a good opportunity to buy or add.
Among the more immediate concerns now are the price of raw materials, labour and the nagging possibility of a windfall tax. But the first two aren't unique problems in business and something which these companies have been handling for years. As compared to most others, glove companies are in a very comfortable position.
This price correction will level off sooner rather than later. I believe institutional buyers would want to have a certain percentage of their investment portfolio in companies that not only can weather the Covid-19 environment but in fact are doing well. Gloves are clearly in this category. And December is the ""window dressing period"" when prices of dividend counters tend to go up."

They might not want to sell their shares (and then buy what with the proceeds?) including with the bonus units. But they'd want ""spending money"" for whatever activities they may have in mind. One way to fulfil this, i.e. ""Having your cake and eating it too"" - a special dividend. This way everyone gets some money while still having his units.
This is just speculation of course. But with Kossan churning in exceptional income this year, a special dividend is definitely possible."

This is very encouraging. Trader hng33 has been around at i3investor from since several years ago. Always open with his buys and sells - sticking his neck out by stating in public his entry and exit points. Unlike wannabes who'd gloat of `making big profits' only after the fact. And keeping quiet about their losses. Anyway hng33 is more often right than wrong with his short-term trades. I'm hoping he's right with this one.
But even if he's wrong, I'm sticking with Kossan for at least a while. Adding more should there be significant drops. Because this is a great business to be in during times like this."

DUBAI (Reuters) - An experimental coronavirus vaccine developed by China’s Sinopharm has 86% efficacy against the virus, the United Arab Emirates health ministry said on Wednesday, citing an interim analysis of a human trial underway there.
The Gulf Arab state in July started Phase 3 clinical trials of the vaccine, developed by Beijing Institute of Biological Product, a unit of Sinopharm’s China National Biotec Group (CNBG). In September, the UAE approved its emergency use for certain groups.
The analysis also shows “99% seroconversion rate of neutralizing antibody and 100% effectiveness in preventing moderate and severe cases of the disease”, the ministry said in a statement carried by the state news agency.
“The analysis shows no serious safety concerns,” it said.
It also said it had officially registered the vaccine, without elaborating, and that 31,000 volunteers across 125 nationalities participated in the UAE trial.

TOPLINE The experimental vaccine developed by China National Pharmaceutical Group, also known as Sinopharm, is 86% effective at preventing Covid-19 infection and 100% effective at preventing severe and moderate disease, health officials from the United Arab Emirates announced Wednesday, although with scarce detail provided about the trial.
The UAE health ministry cited an interim analysis of a late-stage clinical trial involving 31,000 volunteers as the source of its information, though neither they nor Sinopharm provided any data from the trial to validate the claims such as how many participants were infected or how many actually received the vaccine.
The ministry said “no serious safety concerns” were observed, though, again, no information on side effects was provided.
The ministry said the announcement is a “significant vote of confidence by the UAE’s health authorities in the safety and efficacy of this vaccine.”
The ministry added that it had officially registered the vaccine at the request of the manufacturer, which it says could eventually lead to the shot’s widespread authorization.

“The UAE also maintains sound ties with the West so sourcing vaccines from the United States or elsewhere should not be a grave challenge. If the Chinese vaccine is not safe or effective, there is no reason for the UAE to endorse Beijing’s vaccine propaganda and risk its own image and the health of its own people.
“Thus the UAE’s approval and its top leader’s injection of the SinoPharm vaccine have come as a much-needed vote of confidence that will help convince more countries. Diversified supply of vaccines, with viable alternatives from China, is key to ensuring fair and equitable access by poor countries,” said the op-ed.
SinoPharm revealed that senior officials in Egypt and Bahrain also took part in trials held there.

In a note today, Kenanga analyst Raymond Choo said this was lower than its previous price-earnings ratio (PER) of 21 times as he believes the valuations are pegged to supernormal earnings, and the upside to peak earnings should have been factored in.
However, he also raised the glove maker’s estimated net profit for the financial year ending Aug 31, 2020 (FY20E) and FY21E by 16% and 120% respectively to RM1 billion and RM 2 billion, resulting in higher EPS of 38 sen and 100.4 sen."

BEIJING/TOKYO/SEOUL/MANILA/TAIPEI/JAKARTA/DHAKA/HANOI (Dec 11): Trial data from Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc and AstraZeneca Plc has shown their experimental vaccines are effective in preventing novel coronavirus infection.
While regulatory processes are underway, few Asian countries expect to receive significant amounts of the vaccines initially. Here are estimated distribution time lines, supply deals announced and clinical trials being held in the region.
Australia
The country has secured around 140 million doses: 53.8 million from AstraZeneca, 51 million from Novavax Inc, 10 million from Pfizer, and 25.5 million from distribution programme COVAX.
It expects delivery of 3.8 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine in January and February next year and plans to begin inoculations in March.
China
China has not announced supply deals with Western drugmakers, which instead have partnered with private companies in the country.AstraZeneca's vaccine may be approved in China by mid-2021 and its Chinese partner Shenzhen Kangtai Biological Products Co Ltd plans annual production capacity of at least 100 million doses by the end of this year.
For the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, a unit of Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd plans a Phase II trial.
Tibet Rhodiola Pharmaceutical Holding Co is bringing in Russian vaccine candidate Sputnik V and plans early and mid-stage trials in China.
China has also approved three vaccine candidates developed by Sinovac Biotech Ltd and state-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) for emergency use, and Sinopharm hopes its two candidates will get conditional approval for general use this year.
Japan
Japan has deals to buy 120 million doses from Pfizer/BioNTech in the first half of next year and 120 million from AstraZeneca - the first 30 million of which will be shipped by March 2021 - and 250 million from Novavax.
It is also in talks with Johnson & Johnson and has a deal with Shionogi & Co Ltd.
Experts said vaccine makers would need to conduct at least Phase I and II trials in Japan before seeking approval for use.
South Korea
The country has deals to buy 20 million doses each from AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna and another 4 million doses from Johnson & Johnson's Janssen, enough to cover up to 34 million people.It will procure additional doses for 10 million people through COVAX.Inoculation is likely to start in the second quarter of next year to allow time to observe possible side effects.
India
The head of the Serum Institute of India, which makes the AstraZeneca vaccine, said on Nov. 23 the positive late-state trial result of the candidate will allow it to seek emergency use approval by year-end, before securing approval for full introduction by February or March.
India also expects a government-backed vaccine to be launched as early as February. It is also conducting a late-stage trial of Sputnik V.
Taiwan
Taiwan aims to secure around 15 million doses initially, both via the COVAX scheme and by direct purchases from manufacturers, and may buy an additional 15 million doses.
The government has said it hopes to begin vaccinations in the first quarter next year.
Malaysia
The Southeast Asian nation has agreed to buy 12.8 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, becoming the first country in the region to announce a deal with the U.S. drugmaker after some expressed reservations over the need for the ultra-cold storage that the vaccine requires.
Pfizer will deliver the first batch of 1 million doses in the first quarter of next year.
The Philippines
The archipelago announced a deal on Nov. 27 for 2.6 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and is discussing a possible 1 million more, covering about 1% of a population of 108 million people.It is also seeking 20 million to 50 million doses from Sinovac and is in talks with others, including Pfizer.Vaccine makers can seek approval from Philippine regulators even if no clinical trial is conducted in the country.
Indonesia
Southeast Asia's most populous country has secured 125.5 million doses from Sinovac, 30 million from Novavax, is in talks with AstraZeneca and Pfizer to buy 50 million doses each, and expects to get 16 million from COVAX.Indonesia is testing Sinovac's vaccine and preparing mass vaccination for medical staff and other frontline workers to start as soon as late January.
Vietnam
A government official said COVAX vaccines would cover only 20% of the population and the country is likely to have a chance to secure separate deals soon, as demand is very high.
Bangladesh
Bangladesh signed a deal with India's Serum Institute to buy 30 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.It also expects to receive 68 million doses from global vaccine alliance GAVI at a subsidised rate, a senior health ministry official said."

KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 11): JP Morgan has reinstated coverage of Top Glove Corp Bhd, but with an underweight recommendation and a fair value of RM3.50 — that's about half its current market price of RM6.90 — as it sees the passing of a supernormal growth cycle for glove makers, in anticipation of a huge oversupply in the market, as glove demand decelerates in tandem with the pace of testing for Covid-19.
Besides the world's largest rubber glove maker, it also initiated coverage of its closest peers Hartalega Holdings Bhd and Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd, also with UW ratings.
It gave a fair value of RM8.50 for Hartalega, down 38% from its last traded price of RM13.72, and a fair value of RM3.80 to Kossan, which is 30% less than its closing price of RM5.39 today.
Its analysts Jeffrey Ng and YY Cheah, in a note to clients today, said they expect glove prices to weaken in the second half of next year.
""Global testing trends have also plateaued, which ought to ease current supply tightness. JP Morgan’s proprietary fund flow analysis indicates the glove sector is a crowded trade, implying significant downside momentum. Near-term concerns on rising costs, plus long-term overcapacity risk, spell downside risks. Once Malaysia lifts the short selling ban, downward pressure could be amplified,"" they wrote."

Stockraider, are you still in 1980's?"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001389.jsp?ftp=173","Dec 12, 2020 10:29 AM","stockraider","Glove production capacity, they noted, is expected to grow 87% in the next three- to five years from this year’s, with 130 billion pieces per annum capacity to come from the big four glove makers of Top Glove, Hartalega, Kossan and Supermax Corp Bhd, and 20 billion pieces more from non-conventional players.
“The most worrying factor is oversupply, as we see not only significant capex plans from the big four producers but also from new players. While it is hard to measure the potential oversupply, we can take a leaf from the crude palm oil industry which saw a decade of oversupply post a supernormal cycle in the early 2000s,” they noted.
Additionally, glove makers' profitability is expected to be negatively affected by higher raw material prices and rising labour costs. ""Pressure on foreign workers' treatment has and will continue to lift opex. Board members of certain glove producers have also asked for a raise in board fees. All these will add to higher opex and erode margins,"" they wrote.
Amid all this, they think the upside potential for glove stocks may be capped, with retail and foreign participation having reached all-time highs.
Malaysia’s government linked funds are the only hope to lift the sector, they wrote, yet they have also been trimming their exposure recently.
""The market cap of the top-four producers is RM170 billion, equal to 66% of local non-government-linked funds’ AUM (asset under management). Our proprietary analysis shows most funds have exposure in gloves and their cash holdings are low. To date, local mutual funds have invested 11% of AUM in gloves. Retail and foreign participation are at all-time highs. It is thus difficult to find incremental dollars to drive this sector higher,"" the note read.
Meanwhile, they noted that Top Glove and Hartalega's capital management decisions have not been optimal for creating value for shareholders due to the focus on accelerating capex via cash to support capacity growth."

摩根大通在分析报告中指出，手套价格料在明年下半年走软，这意味手套业者的超强盈利能力将结束，使股价存在巨大下行风险。
该行将顶级手套的合理价下调至3.50令吉。若根据周五（11日）闭市水平6.90令吉计算，意即该股有接近50%的下跌空间。
同时，摩根大通也对贺特佳（HARTA，5168，主要板工业）的合理价调整至8.50令吉，对比周五闭市价13.72令吉，也有38%下跌空间。
至于高产柅品（KOSSAN， 7153，主要板工业）的合理价也从周五闭市价5.39令吉，进一步下调至3.80令吉，下跌空间达30%。
摩根大通预测待一旦疫苗变得触手可及，全球手套市场将出现供应过剩的情况，因此大砍手套股合理价高达50%。
“我们的合理价预测是根据公司经常性收入作为评估标准。目前每1000只手套的市场价是100美元（约405令吉），是疫情前价格的5倍。”
摩根大通指出，该行对于2022年手套价格的基准预测是每1000只手套30美元（约122令吉）。也就是说，手套的超强盈利能力将走向终点，股价下行空间高达40%至50%。
“只要马股的卖空禁令一解除，手套股的卖压风险就更大。”
摩根大通指出，目前最令人担心的是手套供应过剩的问题。毕竟除了我国四大天王-顶级手套、速柏玛、贺特佳和高产柅品大举扩张，其他新业者也不断涌入。
“虽然目前仍难以估计手套市场的过剩情况将会有多严重，但这可从2000年时期，原棕油盈利超涨的情况借鉴。”
摩根大通解释道，自原棕油盈利暴涨后之后的10年内，都出现了供应过剩的情况。此情此景，或与当前的手套领域相似。
因此该行指出，手套业近期内的下行风险是成本开销增长，长期风险则是产能过剩。
摩根大通指出，我国政联企业资金是手套领域的唯一希望；但近来可见公积金局也在不断抛售手套股（顶级手套）。
该行指出，目前我国四大手套股的总市值高达1700亿令吉，而我国非政府关联基金的总管理资产值（AUM）仅有1122亿令吉，相当于四大天王手套股的总市值的66%。
“但本地基金已将管理资产值的高达11%投入手套股，已是很高的占比。再加上今年来本地散户和外资不断涌入手套股，已是历史新高纪录。”
摩根大通指出，目前市场已找不到多余资金可提振手套股，除非政府有意注资提振该领域。
“换言之，手套股的上行空间已达到顶限。”
针对市场预期全球手套使用率在疫情后仍会增长一倍，摩根大通认为这项预期过于乐观。
“毕竟全球总人口的成长，其实比手套产能的增长还要慢。”
早就说过很多次了，手套股从来没有undervalue过的，山顶过了当然要下山谁都挡不住的，你不卖没关系市场自然会有人倒货的。lol"

It does'nt take a rocket scientist to figure that the Share price
of THE ASSET (The Underlying Share) will be close to if not less than
the Exercise Price of the Warrant at expiry.
Historical data clearly shows that 95-98% of the investors lose money
in CFD's. In fact. most issuer's around the world have this statement
as a Disclaimer. 2 Pages of a Macquaire Issue Document can be viewwed
in the following link. 2nd page contains all the DISCLAIMERS.
https://imgur.com/zPEaNub
The point here is simple.
1. CFD's have ONE CERTAIN result. The issuer wins.In 95-98% of the cases
the holder of these warrants at expiry lose ALL their investment.
2. Warrants, by themselvews, have ZERO VALUE. They require an
Underlying Asset.
3. The issuers are permitted by law to hedge n the asset without disclosure.
4. The issuers are permitted to short-sell he asset when short-selling
was banned on KLSE. The authorities call them ""Permitted Short-sellers""
In all of the above, the investor has NO SAY. While doing all of the above, the ISSUER ensures that the price of the Actual Asset (The Share) is unjustifiably within the Exercise value of the Warrant (That really has no value).
To top it all, the SC says ""An informed investor is a protected investor""
FYI, CFD's on Equity are banned in several countries including the USA.
They are permitted on Indexes and Currency. Why are they banned elsewhere? The warrants they say are ""Cash Settled"". European Style more so :). Just like the casino.You call this investment ?
From time to time, you have the very same issuers of the warrants issuing Target Prices (THEIR target price) to conveniently suit them.
My only intention is to make people think about the wisdom in such
speculative instruments. As if speculation on a REAL ASSET itself was not enough.
DO WE STILL NEED STRUCTURED WARRANTS ?
It's up to you !"

There is no doubt other glove companies will be making super-normal profit for some time but it will be unfathomable to expect that trajectory of profit increases to continue.
""As the world starts rolling out vaccines and as more people get inoculated against Covid-19, then the catalyst for the huge profits would increasingly get muted. The argument that the vaccine rollout will require the use of gloves is true but much of that will be one time use. The world has a population of 7.8 billion people and 16 billion pieces of gloves, or 32 billion if there needs to be two injections, to administer a vaccine to each and every person. Top Glove alone makes way more than that"".
Then there is competition from new suppliers. Germany is starting to make rubber gloves seeing the demand and profits companies are making, which would indicate that the barriers of entry are not high for a business that can be automated to a way larger degree than it is in Malaysia. Then there is the production increase from existing manufacturers and new players just in Malaysia that are entering the business.
The glove players will make more money than prior to the pandemic but how will the supply dynamics change and prices react will bear watching over the long run."

Bahrain approved the registration of the Sinopharm Group Co Ltd. vaccine against the coronavirus, about a week after the United Arab Emirates registered the Chinese-made vaccine.
“Results from Phase III clinical trials showed an 86% efficacy rate, a 99% seroconversion rate of neutralizing antibody and 100% effectiveness in preventing moderate and severe cases of Covid-19,” the National Health Regulatory Authority said in a statement Sunday.
Bahrain has participated in phase III clinical trials, in which more than 7,700 volunteers signed up. Bahrain had previously authorized the emergency use of the vaccine, which was provided to frontline workers in contact with coronavirus patients.
The UAE registered the Sinopharm vaccine after finding it had a 86% efficacy rate, paving the way for a full public use and allowing for a re-opening of the Gulf nation’s economy.
Egypt plans to start the process of inoculation against the coronavirus after receiving the first shipments of Sinopharm vaccine.

SINGAPORE: The Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) said on Sunday (Dec 13) that it ""holds the position that a COVID-19 vaccine is permissible for Muslim use"".
""We would advise and encourage Muslims to be vaccinated once it is available and when the vaccine has been medically authorised as safe and effective, as this is a basic necessity to protect lives in the context of a global pandemic,"" said MUIS.
The council made its religious position on the vaccine known in a media release.
It said that the objectives of introducing a COVID-19 vaccine and the processes involved in producing vaccines are ""largely aligned to established Islamic principles and values"".
Islamic jurisprudence places great importance on the sanctity and safety of human life and the protection of livelihoods, it said.
Efforts to protect human life from any form of danger and harm, such as the development of vaccines, are therefore highly encouraged in Islam, it added.

Of the 35 employees who tested positive, 20 are from the group's Bestari Jaya operations and the other 15 are from its Next Generation Integrated Glove Manufacturing Complex in Sepang. All of them were asymptomatic during the tests.
Hartalega said the tests were fully completed on Dec 10 and were conducted by an independent clinic certified by the Ministry of Health (MoH).
The affected employees are currently under medical care at a government healthcare facility as per MoH's directive, said Hartalega, adding that all primary contacts of these employees over the past 14 days have been identified and placed under quarantine, and will undergo subsequent tests before they are permitted to return to work."

“We remain bullish as we believe supernormal earnings are here to stay in 2021 and 2022; vaccines will cause a surge in personal protective equipment (PPE) usage, and demand will outstrip supply over the next two years,” it said.
Its top picks are Hartalega (TP: RM25.97) and Kossan (TP: RM9.45), whose average selling prices (ASPs) would be raised more aggressively than peers as the latter play catch-up.
“Also, these companies are direct beneficiaries of increasing daily [new] Covid-19 cases and exceptionally high glove demand.
“2021 is a foregone conclusion — that profit will be exceptional and the same order backlog has flowed into 2022 with no indication of ASPs subsiding yet,” it said.

Because, share price notwithstanding, gloves are a great business to be in right now. An investor simply must have a glove counter or two in his portfolio. The only questions are ""When"" and ""At what price"". Have to do some guessing work here.

(theedgemarkets.com / December 16, 2020 15:29 pm +08)
KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 16): Despite 427 out of a total of 7,004 employees testing positive for Covid-19, Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd founder Tan Sri Lim Kuang Sia expects the impact to be less than 2% of the group's bottom line.
Lim confirmed with theedgemarkets.com that only one site out of the group’s six locations, or 25% of its total output volume, was affected by the outbreak.
“The impact on production is only for two weeks (starting from Dec 4). So, the impact on our profit is less than 2%,” he said.
According to Kenanga Research analyst Choo Ping Khoon, Kossan told analysts in a briefing yesterday that the group conducted a voluntary Covid-19 screening test at its glove division from Dec 4 to Dec 10.
“Out of a total of 7,004 workers, five out of six locations registered zero cases, with only one site reporting 427 positive cases out of 2,104 employees,” he said.
Citing management guidance, Choo said the factory had stopped its operations for sanitisation, which had since been completed.
He also said presently, the other 1,667 workers are undergoing quarantine and will undergo a second round of testing today and tomorrow, with the results expected to be released on Friday.
“Thereafter, the group will undergo random sampling for an antigen test for asymptomatic symptoms in every two weeks [for 20% of workers]. The operation is expected to gradually ramp up production by Dec 20.
“The temporary loss in production comprised 25% of total output volume for two weeks, which is expected to impact the FY20 (financial year ending Dec 31, 2020) estimated bottom line by 2%,” Choo said.
Choo maintained his ""outperform"" call for Kossan with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM9.36.
Affin Hwang Capital analyst Ng Chi Hoong also quoted the management as saying the group’s overall average selling price (ASP) would increase by at least 50% in the fourth quarter of 2020 (4Q20) and 30% to 35% in 1Q21.
He maintained his ""buy"" call and TP of RM8.90 for the stock as he was not overly concerned about potential oversupply occurring in 2022.
“We believe that existing players will have a cost advantage against new entrants due to their highly automated production lines. Current strong relationships with established distributors also allow them to sell their products at a premium,” he said.
AmInvestment Bank analyst Thong Pak Leng also said he likes Kossan as it is one of the biggest glove producers to benefit from the Covid-19 pandemic due to its expansionary plans and efforts in improving quality and operational efficiency.
“Our fair value (FV) of RM5.40 is based on 27 times (the five-year average) price-earnings ratio (PER) over FY22 earnings per share (EPS),” said Thong, who maintained his ""hold"" call for the counter.
He also raised his FY21 net profit forecast for Kossan by 46% after imputing higher ASPs.
“We increase our ASP assumption to US$40/1,000 pieces from US$34/1,000 pieces. However, we cut [our] FY22 earnings [forecast] by 23% with [our] ASP assumption reduced to US$29/1,000 pieces from US$30/1,000 pieces. We make no changes to our FY20 numbers,” he said.

So Western country can have high PE but Asian country cannot have high PE is it? Cos Top Glove PE only 16x already downgraded by JP Morgan.
LOOK AT ZOOM SHARE PRICE. THIS IS A PURE PANDEMIC PLAY COUNTER-WORK FROM HOME VIDEO WARE. JAN 2020 PRICE IS BELOW USD$70. TODAY CLOSED IS STILL $399. STILL MORE THAN 5X UP. AT THE PEAK IS >$500. GLOVES FANTASTIC FOUR IS DEFINITELY MUCH BETTER..
. sentiment is currently against glove so don't waste your energy here against the Naysayers.
Gloves are backed by very strong Fundamental. Gloves demand will continue with or without Convid 19. Gloves will peak by mid next year. My advice is that's the best time to lock your profits if you have not already done and/or Till then, just continue to enjoy the fantastic Dividend and Bonus Issues.

Mutant Coronavirus Strain ""Out Of Control"", Says UK Amid Flights Ban
European countries started banning flights coming from the UK on Sunday as government in London warned that a potent new strain of the virus was ""out of control"".
The moves come as around a third of England's population entered a Christmas lockdown and UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned that the new strain of virus was ""out of control"".
Prime Minister Boris Johnson had said the day before that millions of Britons would have to cancel their Christmas plans and stay home because the new strain was spreading far more quickly.
Speaking on Sky News, Hancock said the situation was ""deadly serious."""

Japan's hospitals facing medical glove shortage
Frontline medical workers in Japan are worried they're running out of an essential piece of protective equipment. They're facing a critical shortfall of medical rubber gloves at the same time as coronavirus infections rise to record levels.
The clinic's deputy director, Doi Yoshiyasu, says it's getting difficult to source the item, and the price has doubled. He urges authorities to prioritize resource allocation to the people who need it most.
A recent survey of medical staff involved in the fight against COVID-19 found the shortage is becoming a serious issue nationwide.
Some facilities have resorted to using gloves that are not medical grade, but Professor Sugawara Erisa, an infection control expert at Tokyo Healthcare University, says that's putting people at risk.
""Sending frontline workers in without medical-grade gloves is like sending them to war without ammunition,"" she says.
One reason for the shortage is that Japan, like many countries, relies heavily on imports.
Malaysia produces two-thirds of the world's rubber gloves. Supramaniam Shanmugam, head of the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association, says global demand far exceeds supply. ""We will be trying to catch up with demand for the next couple of years,"" he says."

(December 27, 2020 7:30 AM)
PETALING JAYA: Two key global glove importers are re-evaluating their relationship with a Malaysian glove manufacturer after government raids uncovered abysmal foreign worker accommodations at two of its subsidiaries.
Kimberly-Clark, the American personal care giant behind household brands such as Kleenex, Scott and Huggies, told FMT it was “evaluating the matter” when asked whether it would continue to source from the company.
Meanwhile, Ansell, an Australian safety and personal protection firm which supplies the UK’s National Health Service, said it was planning to meet the company’s managing director “as quickly as possible” to decide on the consequences of this “unacceptable situation”.
A multi-agency operation at one of the factories on Monday found 781 workers living behind the building in two blocks of shipping containers stacked three storeys high. A separate raid on its sister company on Thursday found workers crammed into two warehouses at either end of a pathway filled with mountains of garbage and factory waste.
“We were shocked to see such living conditions (in the first factory), which are absolutely unacceptable,” said an Ansell spokesperson.
“Based on the photos and video included in the media reports, it is evident that the living conditions provided for some workers at the site are unacceptable and are a violation of Ansell’s ethical labour standards, human rights statement and supplier code of conduct.”
The company also said it was in contact with other suppliers to determine alternatives and ensure it continued to meet the increased global demand for personal protective equipment during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Insisting it was “absolutely not” aware of the living conditions at the first factory, Ansell said a third party audit ordered by the company in May 2019 did not reveal the foreign workers’ dismal living conditions.
“We are investigating why,” it said.
Kimberly-Clark’s spokesperson, meanwhile, said it was concerned by the recent reports and was committed to ensuring that its employees around the world – including those of its suppliers – were treated with respect, with workplace and human rights standards met at all times.
“Through our processes to hold suppliers to high standards of safety, quality and compliance, we have identified some improvement opportunities and will continue to work with (the company) as we would with any supplier to enable meaningful improvements.
“Importantly, we also know that through continued engagement, there is a greater chance of affecting positive outcomes in this regard.”
This is not the first time either of the companies have had to take a closer look at the Malaysian glove manufacturers which they source from.
Ansell – which supplies to hospitals, care homes, local authorities and the private sector – also sources from Top Glove, the world’s largest glove manufacturer.
In 2018, Ansell was forced to investigate allegations that Top Glove was exploiting workers after an ABC News investigation revealed issues such as excessive overtime and costly recruitment fees among its foreign workers.
It is understood that Ansell still sources gloves from Top Glove.
US import ban
In July, two of Top Glove’s subsidiaries were placed on a list of restricted imports into the US by the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) due to alleged forced labour issues.
This came after another Malaysian glove maker, WRP Asia Pacific, was slapped with the same withhold release order on its exports to the US in September 2019 after charges that its gloves were produced with forced labour.
The ban was lifted in March based on information obtained by the CBP showing that the company was no longer producing its rubber gloves under forced labour conditions.
For both Top Glove and WRP, the issue at hand was the exorbitant recruitment fees its foreign workers had to pay to secure jobs at the companies – pushing them into debt bondage, one of the 11 indicators of forced labour according to the International Labour Organization (ILO).
Among the other indicators were poor living conditions, placing the glove company supplying Kimberly-Clark and Ansell at risk of seeing their imports to several US companies being put on hold.
While a CBP representative was unable to disclose whether it was investigating specific entities, he told FMT that the CBP would continue to investigate credible allegations of forced labour in US supply chains and would prevent goods made by forced labour from entering US commerce.
“There are reputational, financial and legal risks associated with importing goods made by forced labour into the US,” said the CBP spokesperson.
“US importers have a responsibility to exercise reasonable care and to ensure that their supply chains are free of forced labour. CBP will not tolerate forced labour in US supply chains.”"

Posted by MoneyMan1688 > Dec 29, 2020 11:43 AM | Report Abuse
Acute shortage of gloves in US, reported by NPR : National Public Radio on 23 Nov 2020.
A combination of long-standing budget shortfalls, lack of domestic manufacturing, snags in the global supply chain and overwhelming demand has meant that the stockpile is short of the gloves, masks and other supplies needed to weather this winter's surge in COVID-19 cases
- Lack of budget, the reasons for ban on M'sia gloves ?
For example, the nitrile glove, the industry standard for protection, is made of synthetic rubber and sourced almost exclusively from Asia, which has led to a global shortage. That's reflected in the stockpile. According to HHS (Department of Health and Human Services), the stockpile contains 22 million pairs overall, including nitrile gloves — only a fraction of the 4.5 billion it wants to have.
- How big is the shortage gap ? Will this spell great demand for gloves after the ban on Msia glove is lifted by US?

AstraZeneca-Oxford Covid Vaccine Gains First Clearance With U.K. Nod
(December 30, 2020, 3:06 PM GMT+8 Updated on December 30, 2020, 4:08 PM GMT+8)
~ Vaccinations to start in new year as cases rise across Britain
~ Recipients to get second shot within 12 weeks of first one
AstraZeneca Plc and the University of Oxford’s Covid-19 vaccine won U.K. clearance, marking the first approval worldwide for a shot that’s faced questions but will be key to mass immunizations.
The vaccine will be prioritized for the country’s most vulnerable groups, with shots starting Monday, according to the government. It’s the second coronavirus injection to be cleared for emergency use in the U.K. after Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s in early December.
The move will help the U.K. ramp up vaccination and provides vindication for the homegrown shot, which has drawn scrutiny over discrepancies in its clinical-trial results. The shot can be deployed swiftly because it’s easier to transport and store than the Pfizer-BioNTech one, requiring only refrigerator temperatures rather than deep freezing. The U.K. has bought 100 million doses.
A first dose of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine will be given to as many people as possible, followed by a second shot four to 12 weeks later. A government advisory group said the priority should be to vaccinate large numbers as quickly as possible rather than completing a two-dose regimen right away.
AstraZeneca shares rose as much as 1.8% early Wednesday in London.
The approval comes as the U.K. seals its divorce from the European Union with a trade deal and tightens lockdowns amid a new surge on coronavirus infections that’s straining hospitals. The U.K. reported a record number of fresh daily Covid cases Tuesday, as a new variant of the pathogen raises concern globally.
The country’s vaccination program has advanced quickly, with more than 600,000 people given shots by Christmas. The U.S. is immunizing an average of only 200,000 people a day, with many states having used just a small percentage of the shipments sent to them this month.
“We will start to get ahead of the pandemic, protect health and economies when the vulnerable are vaccinated everywhere,” said Andrew Pollard, Oxford’s lead investigator for the vaccine.
When patients were given two full shots, the vaccine was 62% effective -- less than the Pfizer-BioNTech shot and another from Moderna Inc. A group that accidentally received half of the first dose showed better protection, with efficacy reaching 90%. But participants were 55 years old or less, and because older people who are most at risk of severe Covid-19 often show more sluggish immune responses, the results leave some doubt as to whether the efficacy will stand up to further testing."

NEXT VIRUS (20??)
Every few years, new and more deadly viruses will emerged. Glove is a safe long term bet
2) Heard immunity need to achieve for covid-19 vaccine to work is 60% of the world population which turn up to be about 4.7 billion people. How long time is needed to produce such a massive amount of vaccine and vaccinate such a massive amount of population? This will be the world largest vaccination effort in the history.
3)Vaccine nationalism
-most of the vaccine that are highly effective now are produced by rich nations which they have invested billions of dollar in it. The vaccine will be given to their country first and then to other rich countries next. Poorer country will be the last to receive the vaccine. This will delay they global vaccination programme
4)Margma 2018 source:Glove consumption per capita range from USA (150), Europe (100), Brazil (24), korea (48), Japan (54), India (4), Indonesia (2) , China (6). With the heightened awareness toward hygenic, there is still ample room for growth of glove consumption in many countries post pandemic.
5) New glove players-likely to fail due to economy of scale and user confidence. As an analog, if u feel safe using Durex as an condom, suddenly there is one company by the name Proton say want to produce the condom, will you dare to use that condom?"

The glove manufacturers are at it again to trap the people. 2 Jan 2021 STAR biz week says 2021 is going to be a great year for gloves. The objective here is to get the retail investors excited and set the trap again.
Please cut losses and stay away from 100% of glove MANUFACTURING counters regardless how high they may recover at a later date. Glove counters are controlled by a group of fund managers who want to ensure that ONLY they will win. Retail or small investors will be destroyed.
It has nothing to do with vaccines, fundamentals, PE ratio, yield nor extremely high profits. It is all to do with the ""glove chonker"" (the so called fund manager). However, having said that, I feel it is safe to invest in glove counters that are presently below RM1 but with caution. We have to teach the fund managers a lesson. Do not touch any glove counters above RM1 !
Once retail investors stay away from Glove Manufacturing Stocks that were artificially inflated by the syndicates, they (the syndicates) will be stuck, whereby their billions will be tied up. Let them finally own 100% of the glove stocks and take them all private. Please note syndicates make money only when general public buy the shares that they sell ! Thank you !"

==================================================
TheEdge Mon, Jan 04, 2021 02:38pm - 5 hours ago
KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 4): Despite the availability of vaccines seen around the globe, Credit Suisse is still positive on the glove sector due to its inexpensive valuation and higher dividends.
Credit Suisse’s co-head of ASEAN securities research and head of research in Malaysia Danny Goh said the glove sector is trading at less than five times P/E multiple versus its historic average of 17%, and is at present offering a dividend of more than 10%.
“Thus, in terms of valuation and dividends point of view, gloves do provide very good value at this point of time,” said Goh, at Credit Suisse's 2021 ASEAN Conference media briefing today.
Based on feedback from the glove makers, Goh said the average selling price is still trending upwards on a quarter-on-quarter basis, noting that 2021 “earnings is pretty much already in the bag”.
“While the pandemic does pose some question marks on how long demand and selling prices could continue to stay firm, but if we were to rely on the feedback of some of the glove makers, the forward orders will last them well into 2022,” he added.
From this perspective, he noted that glove stocks do seem defensive at this point of time, given that it is one of the few sectors that is seeing positive earnings momentum, offering very high dividend yield and trading at very low valuation relative to history.
As at noon break today, the big four rubber glove makers have wiped out RM13.65 billion worth of market capitalisation on Bursa Malaysia, due to the strong selling pressure that is possibly no thanks to the short selling ban that has been lifted as of today."

Overweight
COMPELLING VALUATIONS
======================
RUBBER GLOVES MARKET SHARE
Following the uplifting of the regulated short selling (RSS) suspension, glove makers under our coverage came under heavy selling pressure, with respective share prices declining by 10% to 14% overnight. We are of the view that the extended selldown is rather unwarranted, considering that the fundamentals for glove counters are still intact and stellar results are still expected in the coming quarters, supported by rising gloves’ ASP and tight supplies due to capacity constraints. .
1-No change to fundamentals
Still sound. Despite the unwarranted heavy selldown on glove counters following the uplifting of RSS suspension, fundamentals for the glove makers under our coverage universe remain solid. We expect the glove makers to continue delivering impressive results in the coming quarters. We see an upward ASP trend as the rubber glove supplies continue to be tight due to capacity constraints.
2-Vaccine is not wonder drug.
The rollout of Covid-19 vaccine has greatly dampened the sentiment on glove counters; however, we highlight that glove demand and ASPs are still holding up well, considering the change in consumption pattern and heightened hygiene awareness.
On a side note, with the new Covid strain that is reportedly faster spreading, the existing vaccines developed might not work as effectively in warding off the new strain, potentially prolonging the time needed to inoculate a sufficient percentage of the world population.
3-Buy for its dividends.
Top Glove has committed to special dividend payout of 20%, bringing its total dividend payout for the remaining three quarters in FY21F to 70%.
4-Attractive valuations,
Upgrade to Overweight. Following the recent share price retracement, all three glove makers under our coverage are currently trading at compelling valuation levels."

SBL - Securities Borrowing & Lending
Disposal of 40,000,000 shares (SBL) by Citigroup Nominees (Tempatan) Sdn Bhd - Employees Provident Fund Board.
Those who dont understand, EPF didnt sell 40million TG shares (if it does, it wont appear under SBL).
So basically EPF lend the 40millions to short sellers aka shorties to short. Eventually the shorties will need to return the 40million back to EPF with a fee of course. U need to return something u borrow.
Net2 EPF didnt sold any TG shares plus they earn the fee from the borrower. Win2 situation for EPF.
LIST OF APPROVED BORROWING REPRESENTATIVES FOR SBL:
https://www.bursamalaysia.com/sites/5bb54be15f36ca0af339077a/assets/5d...
Surprise2 JP MORGAN IS THERE (no 6) LOL
So it is a lot clearer now who is the shorties.
The scenario is like this:
EPF lend JP Morgan 40million shares for JP Morgan to short
JP Morgan thinking he can short TG shares to earn money from the market
JP Morgan waiting for panic retailers so they can collect really cheap tickets
JP Morgan already prepare this long time ago by releasing target price of rm3.5 for TG last month.
But alas he never expect EPF, local funds and retailers to be so strong pushing the price up.
EPF also smart collecting more TG shares on 4th of Jan so JP Morgan cant short
EMPLOYEES PROVIDENT FUND BOARD (a substantial shareholder) acquired 6,387,600 shares on 04-Jan-2021.
EMPLOYEES PROVIDENT FUND BOARD (a substantial shareholder) acquired 1,758,900 shares on 04-Jan-2021.
EPF win both sides
The End. RIP shorties"

I think I’ve figured the Approximate formula to arrive at target prices for the IB’s based on the Warrants.
The formula is:
SP – Settlement Price
CMP – Current Market Price
EP – Exercise Price
ER – Exercise Ratio
• We need to assume the SP (Settlement Price) to be the Issue Price.
Break-even price equation:
CMP = (SP X ER) + EP
Example Top Glove C81 – Recently Expired
SP – 0.15
ER – 5
EP – 5.667
CMP = (0.15 X 5) + 5.667
CMP = RM 6.417
VWAP was RM 6.3466
Settlement Price (SP) was RM 0.1359 instead of RM 0.15(Which was the issue price)"

EPF is the biggest mutual fund in the country and the funds came from the public who have to made mandatory contributions by Law. No other fund in the country got the amount of shares or diversity of portfolio to cause that kind of carnage that EPF
help create. Remember that the fund holds blue chips and not speculative small cap stocks that can be cornered to create a artificially high price. EPF got a social responsibility to manage our retirement nest and not to engage in such destructive activity. It is also not a good business decision to lend your shares to drive down the value of the assets you are holding. I encourage all EPF members to bring this to the attention of the Trade Unions, the EPF Investment Committee and the Press. This carnage cause so much misery to the small time Investor who hold this stock for the dividend yield. After all TopGlove's dividend yield is going to be way better than EPS's dividend.

平均售价持续走高 贺特佳顶级手套前景唱好
Nanyang Tue, Jan 12, 2021 09:16pm - 11 hours ago
（吉隆坡12日讯）鉴于全球手套供应短缺，国内手套公司巨头顶级手套（TOPGLOV，7113，主板保健股）和贺特佳（HARTA，5168，主板保健股）管理层均认为，未来手套平均售价（ASP）还有上升空间。
联昌证券研究分析员指出，根据贺特佳的说法，手套平均售价会在2021财政年第三和末季，分别按季上升50%及40%。
贺特佳也认为，由于冠病疫情造成医疗和非医疗领域，对手套的需求旺盛，未来两年手套需求会每年短缺1200亿只。
该公司补充，尽管既有和新进手套公司皆积极扩充产能，但碍于原料供应吃紧、难取得充足劳动力、为遵守1990年工人住宿环境及基本设施最低标准法令（446法令）推高生产成本、疫情持续肆虐影响建厂进度，各公司新产能恐追不上市场需求。
贺特佳已为新一代综合手套制造广场（NGC）第7号厂，建造3条产线，年产量达27亿只手套。其余3条产线，则预计在2021财政年末季完工。
顶级手套也向分析员指出，其手套平均售价料在今年1月和2月，按月上涨15%及10%。3月平均也极可能升高至少5%。
券商给予买入评级
分析员也预估，在去年12月，顶级手套的丁腈手套平均售价，为每1000只113美元（约459令吉）。
顶级手套也已答应会继续加强员工住宿环境，包括将3200名员工，搬迁到可容纳5000人的宿舍。另外，该公司亦会拨出1亿9500万令吉，未来1至2年内，在现有工厂附近建造和购买员工宿舍。
顶级手套有信心，在满足446法令后，美国海关和边境保护局（CBP）将撤销产品入境禁令。
在投资建议方面，分析员均给予贺特佳和顶级手套“增持”评级，目标价分别设在19.50及8.90令吉。

“This is given difficulties in securing raw material supply, not having sufficient workforce, higher costs to comply with Act 446 (of the Workers’ Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act 1990) and construction delays due to the ongoing pandemic.”"

Who Is the Mysterious Gloves Short Seller?
Author: Ben Tan | Publish date: Wed, 13 Jan 2021, 2:36 PM
Since the beginning of last week, many have wondered who the mysterious short seller of gloves, who has spent a whooping RM1.8 billion shorting Top Glove, Hartalega, Kossan, and Supermax within the past 7 working days of this year, is. We might have just indirectly gotten the answer to that question. This short seller is currently sitting on a pile of paper losses as the market prices of the 4 glove giants have gone up (in some cases significantly up) as compared to the average price at which they have been shorted, mostly last week.
First, if you are unfamiliar with the situation, please quickly go through my earlier posts where I cover it more extensively:
The Big (Gloves) Short
Gloves: The Bad Guy Loses (From Time to Time)
Gloves: Zero Short Positions Closed for the Entire Last Week
Earlier today, two truly curious items were published.
First, AmInvest released an analyst report, full of logical inconsistencies, pegging their target price for Top Glove at RM6.50, for Hartalega at RM12.22, and for Kossan at RM4.56. You can read the report here. You can read my thoughts on AmInvest's report and the inconsistencies presented in it here.
More importantly, the chief ""glove bear"" - JP Morgan, have released a research note on Monday, according to reports from The Edge (see here). In this note they reconfirm their target prices for Top Glove at RM3.50, Hartalega at RM8.50, and Kossan at RM3.80. These target prices were first released in a reported dated December 11, 2020, according to an article on The Edge (see here). Unfortunately, we do not have the full report, but only the quoted excerpts, so it is hard to comment on how those target prices have been derived. It would be truly appreciated if anyone who may have access to the actual report could share it.
What we can comment on though, is that JP Morgan's asset management department may not have received this report. As of the last reported date (December 31, 2020), JP Morgan's holding of Top Glove stock has actually increased by 4.06% (see here). Note that as of November 30, 2020, their JPMorgan Malaysia Fund portfolio consisted of 9.4% Top Glove stock and 8.1% Hartalega stock (see here). These are their first and third stocks with highest weightage in their portfolio. The prospectus (same source) states that ""Investments in, or exposure to, any single entity (other than Government and other public securities) cannot exceed 10% of the Fund’s total net asset value."" In other words, JP Morgan owns close to the maximum of Top Glove stock it can own. This might be the first bear investor in the world this could be said for.
So the question that remains unanswered is - are JP Morgan's analysts wrong in their valuations, or are JP Morgan's fund managers wrong to have bought enormous amounts of glove stock and hugely overpriced market valuations?

NST - By Azanis Shahila Aman - December 23, 2020 @ 11:41am
KUALA LUMPUR: The global shortage of rubber gloves will last beyond the first quarter of 2022, according to Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association.
Margma expects the country's export revenue to hit RM29.8 billion this year with global demand estimated to reach 360 billion gloves.
As for 2021, Margma projects an annual demand growth rate of around 15-20 per cent moving forward with projected export revenue to be RM34 billion in 2021 with global demand set to hit 420 billion pieces of gloves."

The rubber gloves market by revenue is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 13% during the period 2021-2026.
The global rubber gloves market by revenue is expected to witness 2.1X times the growth during the forecast period. The market is highly competitive, with a high scope for revenue opportunities and market expansion.
The scope for market growth is high with new entrants entering into collaborations and strategic ventures for market expansion activities. Government agencies are also concerned with public safety and are implementing reforms in healthcare and industrial standards that involve maximizing the use of gloves at workplaces. Ethical norms and corporate procedures further act as drivers for the use of gloves.
The momentum for safety gloves is expected to shoot up that can enforce the need for new innovations and developments following the COVID-19 pandemic where the scenario for shortage supply can be more certain owing to the sudden boom.

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001389.jsp?ftp=187","Jan 15, 2021 2:48 PM","Bullrunrun","KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 15): CGS-CIMB has maintained Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd to ""add"" at RM4.26, but lowered its target price (TP) to RM7.64 from RM9.16 previously.
In a note today, CGS-CIMB analyst Walter Aw said he made no changes to his financial year ended Dec 31, 2020 (FY20) to FY22 forecast earnings per share (EPS) and retained his ""add"" call with the lower TP, which is based on 15 times 2022 estimated price-to-earnings (P/E), from 18 times previously, and was pegged to its previous five-year historical mean.
The analyst noted that while he expected stellar earnings from its FY21 to FY23, thanks to continued high demand and higher average selling prices (ASPs), the forecast earnings are likely to be unsustainable in the long term.
However, he noted that ""we continue to like Kossan for its strong earnings prospects (three-year EPS compound annual per growth of 79.6%) as it stands to benefit from the favourable supply-dynamics in the glove sector owing to Covid-19"".
According to Aw, Kossan’s current valuation has yet to reflect its potential earnings as well as its solid dividend yields.
Notably, Kossan is not discounting the possibility of a special dividend on top of its current dividend payout (minimum 30% of net profit) to reward shareholders due to Covid-19-led demand.
“Kossan stated that the possible implementation of interim dividends is on the cards, in line with the recent announcement of its peers, Supermax and Top Glove,” said Aw, noting that he only inputted a 40% dividend payout for FY20-22F and reflecting dividend yields of 3.8-8.2%.
The analyst also pointed out that Kossan had increased its ASP by 40% quarter-on-quarter in 3Q20 and the demand-led environment will allow it to raise them further.
“In a recent briefing, Kossan said it expects an ASP increase of 50% quarter-on-quarter in fourth quarter 2020 (4Q20) as well as in first quarter of 2021 (1Q21F),” said Aw.
“The company also highlighted that it is not discounting further ASP hikes from 2Q21F onwards, given that its current ASPs are still below the industry average,"" he added.
Last year, Kossan had halted 25% of its total production capacity from Dec 7 to 31 after a Covid-19 outbreak among its employees where 990 cases were detected among its 7,000 workers.
“We estimate the capacity loss at 1.5% of Kossan’s total annual output, and that the financial impact was minimal as we believe the quantum of its ASP hikes would be more than sufficient to offset the temporary capacity loss during the period.""
In terms of global glove demand, Kossan continues to witness strong global glove demand owing to Covid-19.
“We understand that its capacity has been fully taken up until end-CY21F and that it is already receiving orders for 1Q22F,” said Aw.
He added Kossan has also fully filled up its allocation for spot orders, which utilise up 15-20% of its total capacity, till end-1Q21F.
As at 11.25am, Kossan's shares were down 2 sen or 0.47% to RM4.24, with 10.08 million shares traded. The group had a market capitalisation of RM11.03 billion."

It seems like the short seller has mostly given up for now on the idea of breaking even on Top Glove's stock.
Here are the daily short sale trade volumes for today up to now (4:30pm)
Top Glove - 1,450,000 shares (7% of total daily volume)
Hartalega - 1,400,000 shares (25% of total daily volume)
Kossan - 4,700,000 shares (28% of total daily volume)
Supermax - 730,000 shares (<1% of total daily volume)
15/01/2021 4:26 PM
Ben Tan NewbieCK, the volume for Kossan is actually the second highest after the volume from last Monday (the day of the big short).
Regarding Top Glove and Supermax, it is possible that the short seller might not have been able to find counterparties willing to lend out their shares. This seems to be the case in particular with Supermax where the volumes have been low throughout the last couple of weeks.

Although RSS volume is high (30.43% today) and about 19% on the 14th and a very low percentage of about 6% on the 13th, the net short position did not increase much. The Net short position is 1.77% of Issue shares on the 13th and 1.78% on the 14th. So they are obviously blocking to collect. Last minute throw to 4.22 but the RSS volume keep increasing as someone takes the seller."

This is the only glove counter still below the 31st Dec 2020 price. All the rest have gone above last year closing price.
Considering RSS have a 4% limit and the net short amount is already about 1.8%, I really doubt that they will continue to short this counter aggressively."

Limontea got RSS volume at 28%. As I say, they collect the sellers at 4.22 cents (Obviously they calculated the buy Q and decided its worth the effort to throw first )- The final RSS figure is 5.74M shares out of 18.86 million traded ie 30.43%.

According to Aw, Kossan’s current valuation has yet to reflect its potential earnings as well as its solid dividend yields.
Notably, Kossan is not discounting the possibility of a special dividend on top of its current dividend payout (minimum 30% of net profit) to reward shareholders due to Covid-19-led demand.
“Kossan stated that the possible implementation of interim dividends is on the cards, in line with the recent announcement of its peers, Supermax and Top Glove,” said Aw, noting that he only inputted a 40% dividend payout for FY20-22F and reflecting dividend yields of 3.8-8.2%."

Even no mention that they have to buy back after t+2, etc.. seems like forever they can sell the stock, and until the buy it back and return it to CLA, they would continue to pay the interest.
also no mention wheather after that counter reaching 4%, RSS will be susppended for 4 days, and after that ?? shall they continue to shorts for another max 4%??.. what if they have buy back 1-2 percents before reaching that 4%, means that this RSS can go forever la..

By NST Business - January 17, 2021 @ 3:34pm
KUALA LUMPUR: Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd continues to witness strong global glove demand owing to Covid-19 as the company's capacity has been fully taken up until end of 2021, said CSG-CIMB.
Its analyst Walter AW said Kossan had also been receiving orders for the first quarter (Q1) of 2022 and fully filled up its allocation for spot orders, utilising up to 20 per cent of its total capacity, till end of 1Q of this year.
""Kossan has already increased its average selling price (ASP) by 40 per cent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) in the third quarter of 2020. The demand-led environment will allow it to raise them further,"" he said in a report.
In a recent briefing recently, he said Kossan was expecting an ASP increase of 50 per cent QoQ in the fourth quarter of 2020 as well as in Q1 of 2021.
https://www.nst.com.my/business/2021/01/658136/kossans-gloves-orders-f...
""It is not discounting further ASP hikes from the second quarter of 2021 onwards, given that its current ASPs are still below the industry average,"" said Walter.
He said Kossan was not discounting the possibility of a special dividend on top of its current dividend payout (minimum 30 per cent of net profit) to reward shareholders.
""The possible implementation of interim dividends is on the cards, in line with the recent announcement of its peers, Supermax Corp Bhd and Top Glove Corp Bhd.""
He said Kossan's operations had resumed post detection of positive Covid-19 cases after halting 25 per cent of its total production capacity from December 7 to December 31 last year in view of a Covid-19 outbreak among its workers.
""We estimate the capacity loss at 1.5 per cent of Kossan's total annual output, and that the financial impact was minimal. We believe the quantum of its ASP hikes would be more than sufficient to offset the temporary capacity loss during the period.""
CGS-CIMB said Kossan would likely retain its strong earnings prospects as it stands to benefit from the favourable supply-dynamics in the glove sector owing to Covid-19."

The share price then rebounded as quickly as it plunged. Another case in point is Wilmar recently.
So let us not fall into the trap of short-sellers. Of course these short sellers have deep pockets and can push price down further but if the fundamentals of these companies are good, it would rise eventually just like AirAsia and Wilmar. It is a game of poker.
What are the fundamentals :-
If TopGlove CEO had said the lead time between order and delivery for some customers is more than 365 days, it does indicate that current world gloves producers are unable to cope with the demand, otherwise, these customers would have been able to source from alternative producers.
Secondly, medical gloves from new producers can't just be approved overnight; there is a series of checks and audits that recipient countries will have to do before they are able to certify them. In other worlds, the barrier of entries for new producers is high I suspect.
Lastly, if my memory serves me right, Hartalega management had said that acute supply shortage will only ease after 2022.
TopGlove and Kossan I am sure are rectifying their respective labour problems as speedily as they can but in the mean time, I doubt the hospitals will take the risk of instructing their medical personal to not wear gloves just because of the on-going issues.
Is the typical greater good decision making; ie., is saving lives more important now or solving labour problems?
I bet saving lives will take priority and management of the hospitals would give the glove producers the room and deadlines to rectify their management lapses."

Short and distort (S&D) which refers to an unethical and illegal practice that involves shorting a stock and then spreading rumors in an attempt to drive down its price.
S&D traders manipulate stock prices conducting campaigns to drive down the price of the targeted stock.
A short-and-distorter's scheme can only succeed if the S&D trader has some degree of credibility.
A 'short and distort' is the inverse of the better known 'pump and dump' tactic.
Please note that this activity is illegal and should be reported to Bursa.

In its filing with the bourse, Kossan said it saw improvements in all three of its divisions, namely the gloves, technical rubber products (TRP) and cleanroom business segments.
The gloves division achieved 671% growth in pre-tax profit to RM416.65 million.
The TRP division recorded a 19% increase in pre-tax profit, as the division had resumed full operations since the lockdown imposed under the Movement Control Order (MCO), while also seeing a rebound in deliveries in the infrastructure segment.
The cleanroom division’s pre-tax profit soared 1,132% to RM10.19 million, as demand for the division’s products increased as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic."

I monitor at intervals. Kossan become market leader for Gloves. TopGlove and Supermax, no RSS but follow Kossan down. Funny that TG went down more down Kossan.

Author: Koon Yew Yin | Publish date: Wed, 20 Jan 2021, 11:18 AM
Since the Covid 19 pandemic began the demand for gloves far exceeds supply. As a result, all the glove makers can eaily increase their selling prices to make more and more profit which should be reflected on their share prices. Initially all their share prices went up. Unfortunately, for no good reason, their share prices have been dropping in the last few months. This phenomena is so rediculous.
Supermax’s 1st quarter ending September EPS was 39.58 sen. Its prevoius quarter ending June was only 15.19 sen. It made 100% more profit. Its 2nd quarter ending December should be another new record profit which should be announced soon. Among all the glove stocks, Supermax has the best profit growth rate.
Currently Supermax is selling at the projected PE about 3.
I am ashamed to admit my mistake in believing fundamental analysis must eventaully prevail. I believe the truth will set me free and good fundamental will eventualy prevail. As a result, I did not sell my holdings. About 80% of my holding is Supermax and 20% is Top Glove.
I should have sold some of my holdings ealier. Now is too late to sell because each of them has already dropped about 40% from its recent peak.
The price charts for all the 4 leading glove stocks show that they all have been dropping in the last few months despite their excellent fundamental qualities.
Investors must remember that price chart takes preference over fundamtal analysis. You must sell as soon as the price chart is showing a down trend. Never buy a down trending stock even if its fundamental quality is excellent."

TG Open RM:6.10 Close:RM5.50
Shortist had to spend RM573.22 mil with 106mil shares to bring down TG by RM0.60
Shortist average cost was RM5.40
Up to date, shorties had spend RM1.241 bil with average selling price of RM 5.247 ( not considering some position that had been closed)
Assuming that shortist TP is RM4.247 to make RM1.00 (19%) profit.
How many shares do they need to short in order to hit the TP?
By Bursa rule maximum Net Short Position is 4%
As on 18/Jan, TG Net Short Position 2.76%.
Room for shortist is 4% - 2.76% = 1.24% = 103 mil shares
But today (20/Jan) TG closing price is RM6.14, isn’t that shortist have very limited room to push down until hitting the TP price?
Do shortist have other strategy to press down the price?"

However, if the settlement price is below RM 4.00, the warrant holders will get nothing. Note that C7 only will expire on the 26 Apr 2021.
The next call warrant that has a slightly higher strike price is C9 which has a strike price of RM 5.00 and expires on the 15 March 2021.
Unless there are funds out there (that are not the issuer of these 2 warrant) that see Kossan shares as severely under-valued and and start to buy them up consecutively over the next few weeks, Kossan share price I suspect will remain low."

I'm still convinced that shorties couldn't loan from anyone now, hence 0 shorting for last 2 days. Instead, they target the other Glove companies hoping that bringing them down would influence Kossan to drop as well. This may work as Glove investors developed somewhat of a herd mentality, one Glove company impacts another :p
So far, their attack on Gloves have not been successful. They are still hoping that their losses could be narrowed. But their window of opportunity is closing rapidly. Why? Quarter reports are around the corner and they are likely to post record numbers yet again, with likelihood of all to follow TG footstep of paying divvy every quarter. Covid numbers are not getting better fast enough, governments increasing testing efforts instead of JPM's view that testing is decreasing. So yeah, JPM really missed this by a long mile :p
I think many of us are delighted that net short position didn't change yesterday. So, shorties have to buy back 55,609,863 shares before divvy ex. I'm looking forward to a great run up to CNY. Good luck guys! :)"

They must maintain 10 %in margin account, when price down then interest lower and also 10 %of total borrowed amount. But when price up the borrowed amount becomes higher they have to pay more interest and might hit margin call if their fund less than 10 %of borrowed amount. If they can't top up then it will auto buy back shares using the money they short sell untill hit 10%of total borrowed amount"

If Gov say no, but implement it later it will be akin to flip flop instruction. Looking at current MCO implementation, if the Gov maintain as it is the cases will not fall. People can literally travel inter district without any problem shows that current MCO is not really strict at all.
Hence, the chances of full lockdown is more likely to happen whether Eurocham leak the news or not because current MCO is just not working. Today cases still hovering above 3000. Anyone think that it will go down to double digit comes 4th Feb ? Big dream.
Not all manufacturing will be closed fully though. Those considered as essential will remain open. Some peeps say that Glove factory will be closed like any other manufacturing are just dumb as nuts. Glove is the main PPE in fight of this virus. Whole world needs it. And Gov also need the tax from these glove titans to fund the fight against the virus economic impact.
If gloves factory are asked to close, imagine the ASP, it will go up and glove makers will have even longer fulfilling order period to meet the backlog and new incoming order from USA. It will spill over 2023, just on back order alone already 500days++.
It will have potential repeat of V curve for two simple reason.
1. The share price down so much and is so cheap - based on EPS and also the fact the previous bonus split making it more affordable to own.
2. The gloves stellar performance and almost confirm profit and dividend payout is very attractive to fund manager and retailers alike.

Why some can rebound because of undervalued for so long. Why glove can't? Gloves faced big adjustment now as well for many months like klci-30 counters, yet now they are still make a lot of profit. Eventually they will show their value no doubt as a good thing with strong intrinsic value, don't worry nobody will discover it, many will come for it.
I advice those anti-glove, if you don't like glove you can just go to the counters you like, don't make people lose their opportunity."

e.g. (PLS CORRECT ME IF THIS ANALOGY IS INCORRECT)

within 1 mth, bought back and return to you.
1mth interest = 0.4167% = 4.30 x 0.4167% = 1.8 sen

Our glove companies, with whatever imperfections they have, is our national treasure. No matter what institute do or where you stay in Malaysia, it is our pride. To naysay it, to say that after covid is over gloves gonna die, all of that is just unpatriotic and untrue. We should be proud of what we have and what they are doing, supporting them fully to reach the next level, fix their problems and grow bigger. How terrible that when Topglove challenged to become a Fortune 500 and pass Maybank in market cap, we saw what happened. The media manipulation is undeniable. Our local person wants to become a Fortune 500, and people are naysaying that. What do we hope from our successes here? For them to fail? We reward our success with manipulation, single digit PE, and with splitting opinions with some hoping they and their investors lose money. It's terrible. Something big has happened in America, something that shows that the institution and the big money are at our mercy. I believe in that now.
I want this to change. Whoever is still holding gloves have already been through hell, join me by saying eff you to IB, market manipulators, and everyone else. We are retailers, this is our market. Let our winners be winners. I'm not selling and I'm gonna buy more when the market opens tomorrow. I'm not gonna swim with IB. I will be holding.

我想要改变。任何还拥有手套的投资者，谁都已经陷入困境！请加入我们的行列，向投资银行，基金经理，市场操纵者和其他所有人道歉。我们是零售投资者，这是我们的市场。让我们的赢家成为赢家。明天市场开盘时，我不卖出我的股票，我会买更多。我不会跟着他们决定的市场情绪影响着我。我将会持续守着不卖出让他们得逞。我坚信手套股，应该给予合理的估值。 #gloveisgold

compared with Gamestop, our gloves sector very undervalued with almost guaranteed profit, big dividend payout, cash rich companies, and basically nothing like it in bursa.
why should we let IBs and foreign Funds like JPM to RSS and make most profitable gloves stocks loose values.

Thank you /r/wallstreetbets
Yo you have lit the world of financials on fire with GME.
You've broken down every single financial model and decided to take things into your own hands. And you've inspired us to bring our market back into our control.
Well done! We here in Malaysia have been exporting nearly 65% of all gloves in the world and our glove companies are reaching for the stars in profits every quarter. However, our markets might beunder complete domination and supression, that might be manipulating the public media to any way they see fit and to collect shares at the cheapest possible prices. All while causing domino effects of panic selling. Our own people are terrified to invest into our highest performing industry because of constant manipulation. Glove companies like Topglove, Supermax, Hartalega, Kossan , Comfort, Care Plus and a few more other smaller glove producers are now all trading at criminally low PE of less than 15 and forward PE of single digits despite earning record breaking profits because of the pandemic.
Are they perfect? No, everyone can improve their processes, even if they're highly profitable. We are aware of the controversies, let's hold them accountable and ask for improvement.
Are their products saving lives? Yes, imagine how many lives have been saved just from the usage of gloves. They deserve criticism and a chance to improve, not to be supressed like this.
#gloveisgold
- A certain big investment bank has put a target price of 80usd cents per share for Topglove, who earned half a billion usd in profit after tax in one quarter!
- Every time a record breaking quarterly result is released, all glove prices crash, predictably, every single time. Hartalega earned 1 billion in MYR PAT last qr, and it dropped 5% the next day.
- All gloves are on overall downtrend for months now despite breaking records and outperforming every single sector in our country.
We're gonna be fighting in our markets tomorrow, and I want to thank you so much for inspiring us to do it. We retailers are the market. Good luck with your fight, I'm cheering you on!
If you guys wanna help us Malaysians, please spread awareness by sharing my message and upvoting:
""I want to share a message to pump our people up. Our glove companies, with whatever imperfections they have, are our national treasure. No matter what institutes might do to make you think less of them, they are our pride. To naysay them, to say that after covid is over, our gloves are gonna die. All of that is just unpatriotic and untrue. We should be proud of what we have, supporting them fully to reach the next level, fixing their problems, criticizing them fairly for their issues, and help them grow bigger. How terrible that when Topglove challenged to become a Fortune 500 and pass Maybank (An investment bank) in market cap, we saw what happened. Rampant media and price manipulation is undeniable. Our local hero wants to become a Fortune 500, and people are naysaying that. What do we hope from our successes here? For them to fail? We reward our success with manipulation, single digit PE, and with splitting opinions with some hoping they and their investors lose money. It's terrible. Something big has happened in America, something that shows that the institution and the big money are at our mercy. I believe in that now.
I want this to change. Whoever is still holding gloves have already been through hell, join me by saying eff you to investment banks, fund managers, market manipulators, and everyone else. We are retailers, this is our market. Let our winners be winners. I'm not selling and I'm gonna buy more when the market opens tomorrow. I'm not gonna swim with the waves they decide. I will be holding. I believe in gloves strongly and it deserves a fair valuation. #gloveisgold
HOLD. ""

> 对于不看好的人，说在covid结束之后，我们的手套公司将会死掉，所有这些都是不爱国和不真实的。

I am not a financial expert, I am merely sharing my opinion and this is not a call to buy or sell. I do not believe we can do what happened with GME, I just want our market to recognize the value of our gloves.

David and Goliath are often referenced as a moral lesson of how underdogs can overcome the odds and be successful. The phrase “David strategies” has been used to describe what underdogs have to do to overcome Goliaths
In this story, David has bare knuckle brawled with the giant Goliath and beat him up with his bare hands. David wasn't scared because he wasn't going to fight fair. David wasn't picking a fight with a giant, he was using his shepherd skills to kill the Giant the way he would kill a bear or a lion chasing his sheep
Much of what we consider valuable in our world arises out of these kinds of lopsided conflicts, because the act of facing overwhelming odds produces greatness and beauty..

However, the buying spree lost some steam mid-morning, with all of the glove stocks retreating from their peaks.
Seven of the glove stocks listed on Bursa Malaysia ""gapped up"" after the opening bell today, starting the trading day at prices higher than their previous closing on Wednesday.
Top Glove Corp Bhd, which has been the main target of short sellers, opened at RM7.05 versus the previous closing of RM6.21 on Wednesday.
The share price of the world's largest rubber glove maker soared to a high of RM7.12. There were 96.97 million shares changing hands in the morning session, making it the fourth most actively traded stock on Bursa Malaysia.
However, Top Glove's share price came off its peak to close at RM6.67, up 46 sen or 7.41%.
According to trading data from Bursa Malaysia, the total net short selling position was at 239.45 million shares, equivalent to barely 2.9% of Top Glove's paid up capital as at Jan 27.
Its peer Hartalega Holdings Bhd also opened sharply higher at RM13.42 versus RM12.20 on Wednesday. It also came off from the intraday peak of RM13.42 to end the morning session at RM12.86, gaining 66 sen or 5.41%.
Over at Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd, it soared to a high of RM4.59 shortly after the opening bell, up 33 sen or 7.7% from the closing of RM4.26 on Wednesday. Likewise, the upward trend did not gather much steam, with the stock closing at RM4.33, up seven sen or 1.64% at the noon break.
Supermax Corp Bhd, which is expected to release its quarterly results soon, gained 16 sen or 2.44% at the noon break. The stock surged to a high of RM7.16 versus Wednesday's closing of RM6.56. Trading volume was at 29.79 million shares."

Top Glove have NOSH 8202m and a free float of 5000m shares.
As you can see from the above figures, there is a lower % of Kossan free float shares.
Look at the Net Short position. TG is 2.95% (241,895,602 shorted)Kossan is 2.18% ( 55,609,863 shorted) As a percentage of free

From the data collected by vaccine makers (i.e. Novavax, J&J, Sinopharm, etc) which have conducted trials in different countries, the efficacy varied greatly with some seeing as low as 49% in Africa against 89% in UK e.g. Novavax. Another question is how long will the antibody last? And, when the new strain will strike as well as how fast Covid is mutating?
Manaus, Brazil which was being praised for achieving herd immunity by natural infection is seeing a surge in hospitalization after a lapse of 7 months. Reinfection is taking place and some individual was seen infected by 2 different strain at the same time.

Though we hope to see an everlasting high efficiency vaccine, heightened hygiene will be in place till the pandemic is declared over by WHO. That will likely not happen till 2024 onwards when broad population were vaccinated. For now, there'll be structural change in the hygiene practices in all countries (be it whether they have achieve herd immunity or not) unless they lockdown its own economy and close the door to the world. In short, glove manufacturer will enjoy average 15.9% CAGR organic growth + higher ASP in view of the persisting global shortage that may take at least 2 - 3 years to close the gap."

Health experts have identified at least three coronavirus variants in the US that appeared to originate in the UK, South Africa and Brazil. While the average case rate in the US has declined lately, officials are concerned these variants could fuel another surge.
Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that health experts in South Africa have seen that the variant there has such a high rate of reinfection that previous infection did not appear to protect people.
The threat of reinfection comes after the deadliest month of the pandemic. More than 1 in 5 coronavirus deaths were reported in January, equaling 95,000 in all, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Up to now, i think shorties should have not much bullets to use and waiting to be defeated. Why?
1) Since many day ago, shorties should prompt act in order to smaller the gap of losses they have but they don't.
2) They are still in slow pace to correct back their loss status during glove rally recently in the past especially the last 2 days when TG telegram started set up, their short status still keep not much changed with RSS % keep about the same in about 2.98%.
On 4/1/21,They use their high % ratio of RSS fund to short because they know that will be very powerful & effective to press price down at the 1st day of short selling normally because retailers have no preparation & will do panic selling, worse is shorties know also EPF as shares lender to them, EPF definately will follow them to sell fast and buying at low to get returns. So, 1st day short was very intense. Since the short at 1st day, kossan price dropped from 4.5 to 3.94, then keep about this level for 3 - 4 days. Recently the price averagr about 4.3 and never going back to below 4 anymore even shorties keeping on short with their RSS % keep accumulating up.
Before TG telegram force set up at the end of Jan, shorties still unable to correct their losses back even they use a lot of media to publish TG negative news on and on in order to lead & bring down all the glove counters but luckily they still failed to make gloves prices drop to their breakeven price.
I m still confident evil will be defeated soon, Now they only can use psycological way to scare retailers. Don't worry, unite together and hold your share tight. Those who have strong cash flow may consider how to support voluntarily and together to defeat the shorties faster."

On 4/1/21 when RSS started, they move on their sucequence plan to short heavily making retailers & investors lodt more confidence & panic selling. And why they pick topglov as the most target to short becausevthey know it will lead to all the glove counters to fall to get theie evildoing more easy to achieve.
All this clearly doing by evil shorties which spoil all the good fundamental glove countets' prices plummeted. Luckily justice still prevail, now they still making in loss status and seem they are still unable to cortect back so far. Thank godness.
Unite together and don't simply give your valueble tickets to them."

So we cannot support them to get their financial account strong, this make suffering not just for us but those coming in later.

RSS no power or move in slow pace with current loss status they have, this is already give us a clear sign that they are unable to press too low as gloves can always come with support. So they keep using psycological way & keep asking to run or sell. By themselves alone, if they want to press the price, they will lose their tickets and will get more loss to face once the price get support back. So they want manipulate & cheating us to sell together. Say no to them, we won't buy high, hold when fluctuates and waiting to collect cheap with the bullets we reserved. We are not contra players, we have time. But, do you see can shorties wait or not in their loss situation now? They are running out of time. Unknown keep saying JPM are so strong in their financial & trying to scare us, why he want to face thier loss situation for more than a month? We are nothing to worry, we just not to buy at high, hold when it is fluctuate and collect cheap when it dropped. Only with this way, we can end the evildoing manipulators."

How come a shorties in loss situation keep on no action, and just wait price in the risk to go up? It looks very unreasonable and very weird, right?
3 scenarios if shorties no big short:
1) shorties run out the money, just let it be and waiting to be slaughter.
2) they did keep on shorting but short in small amount in more frequency, but this won't help them much to smaller the gap they loss. However they can say no big short, only retailers fight themselves.
3) Conspiracy and fraud with help by other party, actually they are still doing short but figures no show maybe. If this happen, then why they scare people know their short status. If they want & have confidence to win, they supposingly to open the show to let retailer like me afraid, right?
So, why are they waiting for? They short big big not only helping them to smaller the gap of losses, but it will help me or some to collect cheap by the way, and this to someone who miss the chance to get low may consider a good news. However, with the loss situation they have now, they are not just treasure their shares they hold but they are also so eager to get our one. Say no to them."

My advice to shorties or unknown on behalf of shortise. Wait when you shorties have gained then only come out to bark lah. You are in loss status now is fact. Yet still unable manage to correct the loss status, no one will listen to you lah. This only will make your fox's tail exposed to let people to see and investors will have more clearly picture to understand your evil purpose.

制造手套行业用模具的ES陶瓷近来交投炽热，周五闭市时报73仙，全日起1仙或1.4%，成交量达2585万600股。
根据交易所的公告，罗斯里在1月27日买进2455万2500股或5.33%，之后2月3日再增持157万5000股或0.55%。
传统上，手套股都是由华裔控制，罗斯里快速入股ES陶瓷，会否掀起更多土著进军手套业，备受注目。
罗斯里企业生涯始于玲珑集团（Renong）时期，在多家上市公司当过高层，一年前离开世霸动力（SERBADK，5279，主板能源股）。
目前，他活跃在投资控股，之后创办了Vintage资本，担任执行董事。
罗斯里看好手套业前景，据悉他身边还有一些伙伴陆续在市场收购ES陶瓷股票，最终目标是控制这家公司，也有可能会全面献购。"

Personally, I’m bullish on gloves because C19 will be dragged on due to complexity in deploying mass vaccination and vaccine efficacy is another issue too. Kossan has been hammered due to its low profile status and price not supported by Kossan management. It definitely will distribute good dividends in coming years and post covid times. It’s just that the IBs pushed the price down to pick up at much lower price. I earnestly asked everyone to just hold it. Do not sell because this state is just temporary. As you can see in many examples where fair price will prevail but it takes time. Or else, you might regret. My TP for Kossan is MYR 15."

1) Does the RM50mil donation to Government included in this quarter report?
2) Why the tax expenses is higher than normal corporate tax rate of 24%?
RM221mil / [RM764mil -RM50mil*] = 31%
* RM50mil is gain from disposal of land, it should be tax exempted.
My personal opinion is the RM50mil donation to government has been included in the tax expenses of RM221mil. If I took out the RM50mil from RM221mil, the actual tax expenses is RM171mil.
So, RM171mil / RM714mil = 24% (tally with corporate tax rate)"

“You don’t want to get any variant,” Dr. Rasmussen said, “but you really don’t want to get B.1.1.7.”
The variant, also known as B.1.1.7, is spreading rapidly in the United States, doubling roughly every 10 days, another recent study found.
In line with an earlier warning from the C.D.C., the study predicted that by March the variant could become the dominant source of coronavirus infection in the United States, potentially bringing a surge of new cases and increased risk of death."

Have to admit that yesterday was a harrowing day, and I was having doubts about whether the support would hold today. Thankfully it did, plus ending the day on a positive note.
I had gone in too early (as usual) with this counter, and have been averaging the price since then. Normally I would have cut loss instead of buying at different lower price points. But I had decided that Kossan is one of the companies that will continue to do well for at least 2021, and that the downtrend will see an end sooner rather than later. When I'm reasonably sure of this, will be adding more."

According to MRC, the overall rubber products industry contributed almost 5% to national exports in 2020.
The MIDF Research report says Malaysia supplies about 65% of the world’s rubber gloves, which means collectively, Malaysian glove companies have market leader advantages.
The United States was the biggest recipient of Malaysia’s rubber gloves, with one third (33.9%) of exports in 2020.

(PUBLISHED SAT, APR 3 20215:45 PM EDT)
~ The U.S. is now administering more than 3 million new Covid vaccine shots daily, based on a seven-day average of CDC data.
~ On Saturday, the public-health agency reported a record 4.1 million new doses were given.
The U.S. reported on Saturday another daily record of new Covid vaccine doses administered, pushing the weekly average of new shots per day above 3 million, according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The public-health agency on Saturday reported 4.1 million new doses were given, the highest daily mark since the Food and Drug Administration cleared vaccines for emergency use late last year.
About 104.2 million U.S. residents, or 31% of the population, have received at least one vaccine dose, according to the CDC, while 59.9 million people, or 18% of the population, are fully vaccinated. Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines require two doses for full immunity protection; Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine, which received limited clearance in late February, is a single-shot regime.
Three-quarters of U.S. residents who are age 65 and older have received at least one vaccine dose, CDC data shows, providing crucial protection against the disease to a vulnerable group of Americans. As of March 31, nearly 81% of the country’s Covid deaths have occurred in people age 65 and up.
The rise in daily vaccine doses administered comes as available supply increases and eligibility is expanded across the nation. In states such as Texas, Kansas and Ohio, all residents age 16 and older are now able to get the vaccine.
The vaccine milestone Saturday arrives against a somewhat mixed picture for coronavirus cases and deaths in the past week. The country’s seven-day average of new daily infections sits at 64,617, up 6% compared with a week ago, according to a CNBC analysis of Johns Hopkins University data. Cases are growing in 26 states, plus Washington D.C., CNBC’s analysis shows.
However, the U.S. weekly average of new deaths per day is down 12% to 847.
President Joe Biden has urged the country to continue remaining vigilant around coronavirus spread despite significant progress on the vaccine rollout. “Too many Americans are acting as if this fight is over,” Biden said Friday. “It is not.”
Also on Friday, the CDC said people who have been fully vaccinated against Covid can travel at “low risk to themselves,” while still stressing the need to wear a mask and maintain physical distance.
“We continue to encourage every American to get vaccinated as soon as it’s their turn, so we can begin to safely take steps back to our everyday lives,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a statement that accompanied the guidance change. “Vaccines can help us return to the things we love about life, so we encourage every American to get vaccinated as soon as they have the opportunity.”

(April 10, 2021 01:27 am +08)
KUALA LUMPUR (April 9): Kossan Rubber Industries Berhad (Kossan) is the first client to be supplied with recycled water from treated effluents by Pengurusan Air Sdn Bhd (Air Selangor) for industrial use.
Air Selangor and Indah Water Konsortium Sdn Bhd (IWK), in a joint statement, said the reclaimed water for industrial use not linked to food and drinks was produced by Central Water Reclamation Sdn Bhd (Central Water), whereby Air Selangor held a 60% share and IWK held the balance of 40%.
""Central Water will begin its operations by producing a supply of reclaimed water at the treatment plant in Setia Alam which will subsequently be distributed by Air Selangor to Kossan through a range of special pipes from the Central Water reclaimed water treatment plant straight to Kossan’s premises,"" said the statement today.
According to the statement, Central Water today signed a bulk reclaimed water supply agreement with Air Selangor while an agreement to supply reclaimed water to three Kossan subsidiaries was signed between Air Selangor and Kossan, which is among the biggest rubber gloves producers in the world.
The statement added that, as a continuation from the effort, Air Selangor and IWK through Central Water were set to identify other joint ventures related to the IWK treatment plants including its plant in Pantai 2, Kuala Lumpur and Section 23, Shah Alam, to continue to develop the reclaimed water supply industry for the use of various industries.
""This is a long-term commitment of Air Selangor and IWK towards a more efficient and sustainable national water industry development to uphold the national target of recycling 33% of national treated effluents in 2030 under the 2017-2030 Green Technology Master Plan,’’ said the statement.
In March, Air Selangor and IWK had signed a shareholders’ agreement to enter into a joint venture in the reclaimed water industry through the special purpose company, Central Water.
Central Water was set up with the mission to spearhead the reclaimed water industry by optimising the usage of the existing water resources in Selangor, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya and protecting the environment.

Kossan results is out. Surprising the market, the QR announcement was brought forward. Indeed, it is an exceptional results no wonder the management is eager to share the results with shareholders.
It is the highest record profit and revenue ever in their history. To put things into perspective, this quarter alone, the revenue exceeded RM 2 billion and stands at more than 50% of last full year results. On top of that, the net profit alone in this quarter is RM 1.04 Billion which almost exceeded full year results of QR 2020. The company cash balance stands at RM 1.25 billion and net cash of RM 800+ million after deducting borrowings.
How do you know if the results is mind blowing? Well, the analysts consensus forKossan FY 2021 net profit is RM 2.5 billion. In 1 quarter alone Kossan already did RM 1.04 billion which is 41% of the full year consensus. To add a cherry to the top, the management generously dished out 12 sens dividend in 1 quarter which translates to a dividend yield of 3.15% at current price of RM 3.80. All in all, as an investor in companies, one cant ask for more in terms of the delivery of earnings and performance by the company.
One more point to note, the average blended ASP of Kossan is not sky high like Supermax or Top Glove. Based on the calculation of their capacity of 28 billion pieces per annum, the average ASP is US 76 per carton. However, I am not sure if the actual capacity is now at 28 Billion or 32 billion. Taking 32 billion capacity, the ASP is USD 67. Taking a range of USD 67 - 76 ASP, Kossan is able to deliver record earnings. I shall leave it to investors to assess for themselves whether this is a strong financial performance or otherwise."

The glove maker will pay out roughly one-third of its quarterly net profit as interim dividend.
“Against this backdrop, Kossan has delivered its best-ever performance with profit before tax surpassing the RM1 billion mark in the quarter under review, driven by the unprecedented demand for the group’s glove products,” it said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia today

ASPs have not peaked yet
We attended Kossan’s 1QFY21 earnings briefing and came away feeling positive
on the group’s prospects going forward. Despite ASPs rising 50-60% QoQ in
1Q21, we expect ASPs to increase by another 8-10% QoQ in 2Q21. We raise our
FY21/22/23 earnings forecasts by 10.9%/2.5%/5.3% to account for higher than
expected disposable glove ASPs going forward. After adjusting for latest net
cash figure and incorporating higher earnings forecasts, our TP rises from
RM5.22 to RM5.60. Maintain BUY.
Below are the key takeaways from Kossan’s 1Q21 results briefing.
Average Selling Price (ASP) outlook. To recap, Kossan’s ASPs increased by 50-60%
QoQ in 1Q21. Kossan shared that despite the large increase in ASP, they expect this
to grow even more in 2Q21 given that April ASPs have so far been higher than 1Q21.
Overall, we expect 2Q21 ASP to be 8-10% higher QoQ. While one of Kossan’s peers
have reported a slight downtrend in ASPs recently, Kossan reckons that this may be in
part to selling to traders who offered higher prices, instead of actual medical product
distributors, which resulted in unsustainable price levels. All in all, we reiterate our
stance that we do not expect Kossan’s ASPs to decline until 3Q21 at the very earliest .
Volume outlook. In terms of volumes, Kossan’s sales volumes were 2-4% higher in
1Q21 QoQ due to spillover effect from Covid-19 disruptions on operations in 4Q20.
Kossan shared that volumes in 2Q21 is expected to be even higher QoQ as 1Q21 still
took time for operations to reach full capacity in Jan-21 when factories restarted
operations. In totality, we expect higher volumes in FY21 YoY as Kossan shared that
they are (i) on track to add 3.5bn pieces in annual capacity and (ii) capacity has been
fully taken up until end-FY21.
Sales breakdown. We expect glove demand (and hence ASPs) to continue to be
supported by Covid cases rebounding strongly globally, particularly in India (Figure #1-
2). While Kossan does not sell directly to India, they shared that there is little to no
difference in ASPs to different regions. Currently, Kossan’s sales breakdown by
geographic region is as follows: 45-50% America, 30-35% Europe, 15% Asia Pacific
and 5% rest of the world.
Dividend. Recently declared DPS of 12 sen represented just 30% of 1Q21 earnings.
Despite this, Kossan shared that they expect to pay out closer to 40% of full year FY21
earnings. Based on current share price, this would represent a dividend yield of 12.3%
based on our FY21 forecasted net profit.
Forecast. We raise our FY21/22/23 earnings forecasts by 10.9%/2.5%/5.3% to account
for higher than expected disposable glove ASPs going forward, as guided by
management.
Maintain BUY, TP: RM5.60. After adjusting for latest net cash figure and incorporating
higher earnings forecasts, our TP rises from RM5.22 to RM5.60. We value Kossan
using with their pre-pandemic 5-year average PE multiple of 24x (CY15-19) based on
sustainable earnings in a post-super normal earnings environment (FY23) summed
with free cash flows (both discounted back to PV) generated during the boom period.
At current levels, Kossan is trading at a PE of just 3.2x based on FY21 forecasted
earnings. The resurgence of cases globally should be positive for sentiment on glove
stocks. Maintain BUY."

Earlier last month, an analyst from a local investment bank said that the plunge in share prices of Malaysian rubber gloves makers was “unjustified”. The analyst maintained an Overweight call on the sector as he believes that investors might have lost their confidence earlier due to the potential fall in selling prices of gloves on lower demand as more people are being vaccinated globally (CNBC, 9 March).
In the same news article, the analyst also mentioned that the jump in average selling prices of gloves is not sustainable and forecast of 30% to 35% fall in prices in 2022, while he expected that the gloves prices will likely remain above pre-pandemic levels for the next two to three years at least. This is partly due to the demand for gloves that is expected to remain elevated in the coming years as the medical sector uses more as their personal protective equipment.

And whats more u think the gloves company normalise far lower earnings base on selling price of USD 25 can still support the mkt cap of topgloves Rm 46.3b, Harta Rm 35.3b and supermax Rm 16.4b leh ??

The 6 - 7 Digits Investors
They are pretty cool. The men are usually handsome while the women are beautiful and elegant. They have long and strong holding power. They know price fluctuation is part of the playing fields. They only invest based on Fundamental and only trade when necessary i.e. when they want to go for the kill. They usually go for the mother shares and they won't waste time playing with call warrants as they prefer to deals with real stakeholders. They let their investment works for them and they live like King. They only come here when they get bored or want to have some fun.
3 - 5 Digit Traders
They are really the noisy one. They are like a new wed young Amoi on her 1st night. They are usually short and has no holding power. Their noises get lounder as the Volatility get intense since they need to move with their limited fund to move Up or down. Some time they need to swing left and right to control their climax. Since they are not self sufficient, they usually hires some runner just to shout ""RM 4 is coming"" so they can collect it cheap..
Here the sad part, all these movement needs money. So they started coming here one by one just to earn 25 sen per post. Some are too shy, so they starts disguising themselves with new id.
Enjoy your weekend Guys and Gals ..

Everybody has their rights to put forth their point of view for consideration. Although it can be a bit annoying that those who have sold off earlier and have missed out on the current uptrend are making the most noise and scraping the bottom of barrel to come up with some arguments against the glove stocks as if their arguments can suddenly reverse the trend to match their belief that glove bull run has ended. If really that happens then it would pacify their ego and redeem their earlier decision to sell off.
However, if the uptrend keeps going up and turn into a super bull for glove, then they will be having endless sleepless nights regretting and worst still to swallow their highly guarded pride."

They can just invest in new plants, machineries, lands, technologies, or even acquire other strategic assets without the need to loan from banks. They also can pay off their existing loans and debts to the financial institution and saved on interests. Could also develop new channels such as own distribution networks / own brand, etc. The actual valuation of the company should be 3-5 years from now after the pandemic and how the management actually invest their new found wealth. That would differentiate them from the peers and leapfrog the company to another level. Top Glove is already investing into better accommodation and automation. Supermax is opening up new plants in Northern America and focusing on the new biz of lens and masks. If the company just purely invest in opening new plants in Malaysia, that would be shortsighted. They should think deeper on the whole supply chain and how to gain from it with their hoard of cash now."

(Bloomberg News / May 10, 2021, 7:07 AM GMT+8)
U.S. deaths from Covid-19 have been undercounted, President Joe Biden’s top medical adviser said, with the nationwide toll approaching 582,000. New cases in the U.S. dropped over the past week to the slowest pace since the end of September. Hospitalizations dipped to a seven-month low.
With more than a third of its adult population now fully vaccinated, the U.K. reported just two virus deaths on Sunday. The European Union hasn’t renewed its order for the AstraZeneca Plc vaccine beyond June.

07 May 2021 11:34PM (Updated: 08 May 2021 12:11AM)
GENEVA: The World Health Organization announced on Friday (May 7) it had approved a COVID-19 vaccine from China's state-owned drugmaker Sinopharm for emergency use.
The vaccine, one of two main Chinese shots that collectively have already been given to hundreds of millions of people in China and abroad, becomes the first COVID-19 shot developed by a non-Western country to win the WHO's backing.
It is also the first time the WHO has given emergency use approval to any Chinese vaccine for any infectious disease.
A WHO emergency listing is a signal to national regulators on a product's safety and efficacy, and would allow the shot to be included in COVAX, the global programme to provide vaccines mainly for poor countries.
""This afternoon, WHO gave emergency use listing to Sinopharm Beijing's COVID-19 vaccine, making it the sixth vaccine to receive WHO validation for safety, efficacy and quality,"" the UN health agency's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference.
Tedros also said that a separate expert panel has recommended two doses of Sinopharm vaccine for those aged 18 and above.
The WHO has previously given emergency approval to COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and, last week, Moderna.
The decision to approve Sinopharm's vaccine was taken by WHO's technical advisory group, which began meeting on Apr 26 to review the latest clinical data as well as Sinopharm's manufacturing practices.
A separate group of WHO experts, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE), voiced concern this week over data provided by Sinopharm on the risk of serious side-effects in some patients, but was confident in the vaccine's ability to prevent disease, according to a document reviewed by Reuters.
SAGE found an efficacy of 78.1 per cent after two doses in multi-country Phase III clinical trials, according to the document. The vaccine's developer, Beijing Biological Products Institute, a unit of Sinopharm subsidiary China National Biotec Group, had announced an efficacy of 79.34 per cent.
The WHO has said it could reach a decision on China's other main COVID-19 vaccine, made by Sinovac Biotech, as soon as next week. The technical experts reviewed it on Wednesday.
China has deployed around 65 million doses of the Sinopharm vaccine and more than 200 million doses of the Sinovac shot. Both have been exported to many countries, particularly in Latin America, Asia and Africa, many of which have had difficulty securing supplies of vaccines developed in the West.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has started a rolling review of China's Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine, the EU's top drug regulator announced Tuesday, and experts said that once the vaccine is approved, China will further fulfill its international responsibilities as a major power and provide support to the international community in the pandemic fight.
Sinovac and another China-produced COVID-19 jab, Sinopharm, are also under WHO assessment for emergency use, and results are anticipated in a week.
The EMA said the decision on whether Sinovac can be marketed in Europe will be based on preliminary results from laboratory and clinical studies.
According to the EMA, a rolling review is to speed up the assessment of a promising medicine during a public health emergency, allowing data to be reviewed as they become available from ongoing studies. A specific timeframe for the review is not provided, but the EMA said the process should ""take less time than normal.""
Sources at Sinovac told the Global Times on Wednesday that since there are many COVID-19 vaccines awaiting EMA approval, the process is not expected to be completed soon. The previous four vaccines took two to three months to be approved after rolling reviews began.
The agency has ongoing rolling reviews of three other vaccines, Sputnik, CureVac and Novavax.
The EMA has previously approved four COVID-19 vaccines, developed by BioNTech and Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Janssen. If approved, the Sinovac vaccine will be the first non-Western COVID-19 vaccine to receive marketing authorization in the EU.
In April, Sinopharm's COVID-19 vaccine received a Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certificate from Hungarian authorities, the first Chinese COVID-19 vaccine to receive such a certificate from an EU country and a step forward for Chinese vaccines to become a global public good.
Vaccine experts pointed out that the issuance greatly enhances the competitiveness of China-produced vaccines in Europe and the confidence of smaller European countries in Chinese vaccines given the uneven distribution of vaccines in Europe.
""With reference to this certificate, it is also more likely that the EMA will approve the Chinese vaccine market license more quickly,"" Tao Lina, a Shanghai-based vaccine expert told the Global Times on Wednesday.
Sinovac and Sinopharm are also under WHO assessment for emergency use, and the results are anticipated in early May.

PUBLISHED THU, MAY 13 202112:39 PM EDT
~ In its guidelines, the CDC says “fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a mask outdoors, except in certain crowded settings and venues.”
~ “We got to make that transition ... if you are going into a completely crowded situation where people are essentially falling all over each other, then you wear a mask,” Fauci said.
~ A report by the New York Times cites experts that say the CDC number is misleading, and that the actual number of outdoor transmissions could actually be below 0.1%.
Americans need to start getting used to seeing people outside without masks as more and more people get vaccinated against Covid-19, White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Thursday.
Fauci reiterated new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that said fully vaccinated people didn’t need to wear masks in public, unless they were in a crowd.
“We got to make that transition,” Fauci said in an interview with CBS News after anchor Gayle King said people give her “the side-eye” when she takes her mask off outside, even though she’s fully vaccinated. “If you are vaccinated and you are outside, put aside your mask, you don’t have to wear it.”
There is debate among medical experts over how much outdoor transmission is driving cases.
“The top line result of all studies included in the systematic review said less than 10% of cases are transmitted outdoors,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Tuesday at a Senate hearing.
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, blasted Walensky during the hearing, saying the agency’s “conflicting, confusing guidelines ... undermined public confidence and contradicts the scientific guidance of many experts.”
A report by the New York Times cites epidemiologists that say the CDC number is misleading, and that the actual number of outdoor transmissions could actually be below 0.1%.
Reports of new Covid-19 cases continued to decline in the U.S., averaging of 36,700 new cases per day over the last week as of Wednesday, the lowest daily case average Sept. 14, data complied by John Hopkins University shows.

（华盛顿24日讯）美国新冠肺炎疫情正在逐渐改善，单日新增确诊低于3万起，这是自去年6月以来的首次，而其单日死亡病例也降至去年夏季以来的最低水平。其中加州三藩市最大的医院之一San Francisco General Hospital，在上周四首次出现零新冠肺炎患者，是疫情爆发以来首次出现。
根据约翰霍普金斯大学数据统计得出，截至当地时间周日为止，美国过去7天平均每天新增确诊人数降至2万6000人，是去年6月以来最低。
美国疾病控制和预防中心（CDC）数据显示，截至周日为止，1亿633万民众接种至少一剂疫苗，相当于美国人口总数的49%；1亿3000万人完整接种疫苗，相当于美国人口总数的39%。
美国食品及药物管理局（FDA）前主管戈特利布，在周日接受哥伦比亚广播公司（CBS）节目访问时说：“我相信到了6月，我们的每天感染率可能会下降到每10万人一起，那将是一个非常低的水平。”
华盛顿大学健康指标与评估研究所的一项模型预测，估计至8月中旬，日均确诊人数跌至7000宗以下，死亡人数将少于120人，大约是目前感染人数的1/5，是去年3月以来新低。
有利经济复苏
来临的周末是美国阵亡将士纪念日假期，传统上是夏季开始的时间，确诊人数下滑，可望刺激更多美国民众出外度假，享受夏季假期，有利经济复苏。
由于疫情缓和，部分州已相继放宽防疫措施，其中纽约、康涅狄格及新泽西容许企业已于周三起全面启业，加州则将于6月15日实行相同措施。
拜登政府发布的新冠肺炎病毒概况报告中，把美国大多数地区定义为低至中度新冠肺炎病毒感染风险。
报告亦指，有694个县的传染水平高仍然高企，但数量已减少至不足4月时的一半。确诊数字高企的地区包括，深南部地区的亚拉巴马州、佐治亚州等、洛矶山脉及西北部地区。
波士顿学院公卫专家兰德里根教授表示，新增病例数在全美范围呈现下降趋势，表明疫苗正在起作用；但美国各地接种率有差异，接种率较低地区恐被传染力和对疫苗耐受力更强的变种病毒攻陷，进而影响全美防疫局势。
他警告，只有全美85%人口都完成接种，才能防止新一波疫情出现，所以民众在未来数月仍需保持警惕。"

Just let our Front liners continue to save the world. Let them to the job..
Meanwhile while waiting come and join Mabel into the Plantation.
We have a job to do to feed 8 billion population across the planet..
Plantation companies are very likely to make windfall profits in first 6 months of 2021.
Monthly average CPO prices for April 2021 is RM4,220 per tonne, 83% more than RM2,299 for April 2020.
Monthly average CPO prices are ~RM2,300 per tonne in 2Q2020. As long as CPO prices remain above RM3,000 per tonne, plantation stocks will continue to make windfall profits.
