Its executive director Lim Cheong Guan noted that the ASP of nitrile gloves fell 20% in Top Glove's third financial quarter ended May 31, 2021 (3QFY21).
""The ASP adjustment was in line with market pricing trends and lesser sales volume to the US,"" he told a virtual press conference held in conjunction with the announcement of the group's latest quarterly results.
Lim expects lower nitrile latex prices as costs of the raw materials, namely butadiene and acrylonitrile, are expected to decline by 10% and 6% respectively between May and August.
""A lower natural rubber latex concentrate price is expected in the coming months as the wintering season ended in May 2021, and yields are expected to improve,"" he added.
The world's largest glove manufacturer posted a softer quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) performance for 3QFY21.
Its net profit fell 29.03% to RM2.03 billion from RM2.87 billion for 2QFY21, while revenue shrank 22.42% to RM4.16 billion from RM5.37 billion, as the group was barred from exporting to the US.
The group said the weaker q-o-q performance was owing to a decline in ASPs by 16%, a lower sales quantity following a temporary halt in shipments to the US from Malaysia and higher latex as well as natural rubber latex concentrate prices.
On a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis, the group’s quarterly net profit jumped almost five times to RM2.04 billion from RM347.9 million a year earlier on a higher revenue.
Revenue climbed to RM4.16 billion for 3QFY21 from RM1.69 billion previously.
Despite the weaker earnings performance, Top Glove declared a dividend of 18 sen a share, including a special dividend of 5.3 sen.
Top Glove gained six sen to close at RM4.84 today, with a market capitalisation of RM39.72 billion. It saw 34.54 million shares traded."

Its analyst Chua Siu Li in a note today cut her earnings forecasts for the sector by 10% to 35% on the back of lower ASP assumptions.
According to her, the improving Covid-19 situations in the US and EU resulted in much lesser urgency for distributors to immediately replenish inventories back to usual levels of two to three months.
“The buyers are adopting a more careful stance currently to avoid locking in purchases at high prices.
“We expect ASPs of gloves to start trending lower in the second half, supported by the improved Covid-19 situation as well as lower raw material prices as tight supply of nitrile butadiene latex continues to ease and [with a] better yield for latex concentrate after the end of the wintering season in May,” she said.
She also noted that glove makers’ commitment to stepping up on their social compliance practices will also translate into higher costs going forward, and she reckoned that it would take time for glove makers to fully pass on the cost increase to buyers, so it should result in margin compression in the near term.
Chua downgraded her rating of Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd to ""neutral"", with a lower target price (TP) of RM3.65.
“We cut our FY21 to FY23 earnings forecasts for Kossan by 37% to 51% to account for the expected decline in ASPs,” she said.
She also maintained her ""neutral"" call on Top Glove Corp Bhd but lowered her TP to RM4.40."

Don't believe me?
I went to a bank yesterday and saw even some tellers were wearing gloves, not all of them though. It is not far fetched to suggest that very soon it could become company policy to supply gloves to all their front line staff.
Just imagine all the other sectors other than medical where people starts wearing gloves as a precaution for example aviation, f&b, cashiers, barbers, masseurs, beauticians etc etc. I can go on and on until tomorrow...
The more countries open up, the more the demand for gloves will be.
One more thing, even if the market crashes tomorrow, gloves will remain strong solely due to its extraordinary earnings for years to come.

MYEG计划8月起供应1000万剂疫苗
2021年06月25日
（吉隆坡25日讯）MYEG（MYEG，0138，主板科技股）计划今年8月起，在国内供应1000万剂疫苗。
MYEG周五发文告指出，已和安徽智飞生物制药公司签署意向书，向后者购买1000万剂疫苗，并在8月起供应予国人。
相关成本待定。同时，正式分发疫苗前，需获得国家药剂监管机构（NPRA）的批准。
“公司有信心，疫苗获准在国内分发后，将加速推动我国走向全民免疫。”
周五闭市，MYEG收报1.82令吉，无起落，交易量约为843万股。"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001389.jsp?ftp=241","Jun 26, 2021 12:58 AM","Mr.Sm Invest123","KUALA LUMPUR (Bernama) -- My E.G. Services Bhd has signed a letter of intent (LOI) to purchase 10 million doses of Anhui Zhifei Biopharmaceutical Co Ltd’s COVID-19 vaccine, ensuring that the corresponding quantity of its recombinant protein subunit vaccine is reserved for delivery as early as August.
In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, MYEG said it holds three-year rights to exclusively distribute the vaccine in Malaysia while through a separate partnership, the group has two-year exclusive distribution rights to the vaccine in the Philippines and is presently in discussions to distribute in other countries.
""Last week, MYEG announced plans for the roll-out of a vaccination programme in the Philippines that will cover the provision of the vaccines to the public health segment as well as private sales,” it said.
The LOI is to ensure that the corresponding quantity of Zhifei’s recombinant protein subunit vaccine is reserved for delivery as early as August when vaccination through the private market is enabled.
""This paves the way for the vaccine to be imported and made available to Malaysians as soon as the private market commences and subject to the conditional authorisation of the vaccine by the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA),” it said.
The cost of the vaccine will be determined later subject to the conditional authorisation by NPRA.
MYEG said it is confident that when the Zhifei vaccine becomes available locally, it can play an important role in accelerating the country’s drive towards achieving herd immunity against the COVID-19 virus.
Jointly developed by Zhifei and the Institute of Microbiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the vaccine has fast emerged as among the preferred vaccines in China since gaining emergency use authorisation there in early March in view of its distinct inherent advantages as a recombinant protein subunit vaccine. More than 60 million doses have already been administered in more than a dozen provincial-level regions, including Beijing. The vaccine is also being used in Uzbekistan.
Recombinant protein technology is proven, having been used for the development of vaccines such as hepatitis B and shingles.
In addition, recombinant protein vaccines can be more easily produced at a large-scale since production does not need to be carried out in high-grade biosafety laboratories, and they are also more cost-effective and easier to store and transport.
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, MYEG has leveraged its strengths and expertise as a leading digital services provider in the region to introduce a number of significant initiatives as part of a holistic solution aimed at helping in the fight against the pandemic.
Besides vaccines, these offerings include screening services, quarantine management and digital health travel pass systems."

（新加坡30日讯）新加坡政府已同制药公司葛兰素史克（GSK）和Vir Biotechnology签订预购协议，购买两家公司共同研发的单克隆抗体药物Sotrovimab。
上述研发公司已在流行病特别采用程序下向新加坡卫生科学局提交批准申请。这款抗体药物适用于无需补充氧气，但病情可能恶化至出现严重症状的轻度和中度新冠病毒患者。
葛兰素史克新加坡医药总监霍恩医生受访时透露，作为一款单克隆抗体药物，Sotrovimab可以直接对抗病毒的感染，无需等待人体免疫系统反应。
“药物通过附著在病毒刺突蛋白质上消灭病毒，也就是阻止病毒进入人体细胞，并清除受感染的细胞。”
她说，变种毒株和二度感染的风险增加，意味全球必须同时关注疫苗和药物治疗，有效的药物对还未接种或不适合接种的确诊病患非常重要，能避免他们出现严重症状或死亡。"

风光不再大幅调低手套股目标价格
02/07/2021
手套业＂金发女郎幸福日子＂不再有？马来亚投资银行指出，手套平均售价（ASP）在今年上半年＂触顶＂，随新冠疫苗接种率提高，售价开始滑坡，手套股最风光日子一去不复返。
马来亚投行最新报告指出，手套集团盈利上涨趋势出现掉头，因为手套平均售价滑跌的速度，比预期更快。
「平均售价滑跌，意味手套集团盈利滑跌，主要是受供应大幅增加，疫苗接种率提高，以及行业竞争激烈，最风光的日子不再有。」
该行分析员指出，手套集团更面对全球环境，社会及监管标准的压力，估值会因此滑落。
贺特佳(HARTA 5168)最近向分析员举行汇报时透露，手套平均售价在下个月会进一步滑跌。
根据一家国际会计楼报告指出，丁腈手套平均售价将在2023年时下跌52%至59%之间，每1000只手套售价是35美元至20美元之间。相比目前的每1000只手套US$85/US$42.70。
马来亚投行调低高产柅品（KOSSAN）和顶级手套（TOPGLOVE）评级至＂观望＂，不过维持贺特佳（HARTA）的＂买进＂评级。
该行将贺特佳目标价由RM13.10调低至RM9.80，高产柅品目标价格由RM5.25调低至RM3.20。
顶级手套目标价格也由RM4.51调低至RM3.98。

（八打灵再也4日讯）非政府组织女主席，因自拍视频称雪州爆发新冠肺炎疫情，归咎于一间著名手套制造公司，而遭警方开档调查。
八打灵再也警区主任莫哈末法鲁丁助理总监发文告指出，警方于4日接获民众投报，称一名非政府组织女主席，在短影片平台抖音上载一段自拍视频，称雪州爆发新冠肺炎疫情，得归咎于一间手套制造公司，而展开调查。
他说，警方现援引刑事法典第505（b）项条文（发表或流传危害民众的声明）、刑事法典269 条文（疏忽而可能传播病毒危害他人、1988年传染病预防和控制法令（342法令） 第22（b）条文，对案件进行调查。

大马橡胶手套制造商公会主席苏巴马廉在发文告表示，其成员向全球 195 个国家生产和出口手套，占全球供应量的2/3以上。
“自从政府宣布雪州落实强管令以来，全球客户一直在致电厂商，对手套是否及时交货，表示非常担忧。”
他说，这给橡胶手套制造商带来了巨大压力。
他指出，虽然该公会支持政府遏制新冠肺炎传播的措施，因此他们在国家复苏计划第一阶段以60%的人手限制运作，但强管令期间的停止运作，严重削弱了工厂生产手套的能力，以供应给全球需求。
“因此，我们呼吁国际贸易及工业部召开紧急会议，共同努力解决各方的问题。”
“我们紧急呼吁，政府允许这些手套工厂在遵守严格的 SOP下继续运营。”
他指出，橡胶手套制造商已经同意根据不同的州和国家疫苗接种计划，为所有员工接种疫苗，目前正在等待疫苗抵达。
他也说，制造商一直遵守政府现有的 SOP，并承诺承担唾液检测试剂盒的费用，以确保可以对工人进行频繁的筛查。"

Another challenge is the shipment. The freight rate has increased almost 10 times compare to a year ago due to shortage of containers. Shipment from China to Europe would take additional 2-3 weeks in comparison with Malaysia and 50% more expensive than from Malaysia. Hence, even if China can produce, the buyers would consider such factors of higher freight rate, longer shipment time and whether their clients are receptive to China made products - gloves. Bear in mind that Supermax and Top Glove have higher inventories and this could be good time to reduce their inventories since they have been producing more due to new production lines."

It has gradually entered the bottoming stage. With the gradual elimination of external noise, I believe that the glove stock will adjust its direction soon. But some patience is required in the process, because the technical analysis part is still waiting for a key opportunity. It may take at least 1~2 weeks to definitely reverse the trend.

KUALA LUMPUR (July 14): The Government may need to impose a windfall tax on companies that recorded extraordinary profits during the Covid-19 pandemic, said former Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.
According to him, the tax will enable the Government to increase its financial resources as well as help the people who are affected and increasingly squeezed by the Covid-19 pandemic.
“This windfall tax is not an unusual thing...this may help the Government because in this time of emergency and Covid-19 problem, we have to spend a lot because we need to help the poor, to give out extra income and we need to feed people who have no food.
“So all these need to be done and require money. But if we follow taxes normally, there will be less (economic) activities and the Government will also get less taxes,"" he said as a member of the forum panel entitled 'Can the Malaysian Economy be Saved?' which was posted on Facebook Reset Malaysia today.
Dr Mahathir said the Government was also advised to focus fully on fighting Covid-19 and restructure the distribution of allocations from non-essential items to more important items.
Asked whether the Government should reintroduce the Goods and Services Tax (GST) to increase the country's coffers, the former Prime Minister said introducing a new tax in the current situation would not alleviate the problems faced by the Government."

In one region of Israel, he noted, more than 80% of the population had been fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, but there had still been a “serious outbreak” of Covid. Rubin told the panel that without eliminating the virus, even a vaccinated population could “collapse under the next variant.”
“An infectious carrier of the delta variant will infect his family even when they are fully vaccinated. If you live with a child who is a delta carrier, he will infect the parents,” he said, adding that Israel was seeing serious cases and hospitalizations even in fully vaccinated patients."

（华盛顿23日讯）美国疾病预防和控制中心(CDC)主任瓦伦斯基，当地时间周四再次对美国当前疫情发出紧急呼吁，警告称美国尚未完全脱离疫情。另一方面，美国出现“超级真菌”传播事件，已造成3人死亡。
中新网报导，瓦伦斯基表示，印度变种病毒Delta是科学家见过的最具传染性的呼吸道病毒之一。
她强调，Delta比之前的（新冠肺炎）毒株更具侵略性和传染性。 “这是我们目前所知的、也是我从业20年以来所见的，最具传染性的呼吸道病毒之一。”
Delta目前正在全美迅速传播，截至本周，在已测序的病例中，感染该变种病毒的病例已经占到总数的83%；而在7月初，这个数字还只有50%。
瓦伦斯基还对全美疫情发出警告，称Delta正在低疫苗接种率地区广泛传播，这是美国又一个抗疫的“关键时刻”。
瓦伦斯基恳请尚未接种疫苗的人“严肃对待Delta ”。她强调，“这种病毒不会自动放弃，它会不断搜寻脆弱的人并感染他们。请考虑接种疫苗，并在此前注意防疫”。
《纽约时报》指出，这与白宫数周前的态度形成鲜明对比。独立日期间，美国总统拜登在白宫南草坪举行盛大派对，宣布美国“从疫情中独立了”。
报导称，瓦伦斯基最新的表态显示，官方越来越担心已经取得的成就正在丧失，当前激增的病例可能让那些疫苗普及率低、住院率高的地方卫生系统不堪重负。
3类主要药物无效
另一方面，美国卫生官员周四表示，现在有证据表明，一种“无法治愈”的真菌在两家医院和一家疗养院内传播，已造成3人死亡。
根据美国疾控中心的报告，华盛顿特区的一家疗养院和得州达拉斯地区的两家医院爆发“超级真菌”感染。少数患者患有侵袭性真菌感染，3类主要药物对这些感染都是无效的。
美国疾控中心的博士莱曼称，“这确实是我们第一次开始看到耐药性聚集病例”，其中患者显然是在相互感染。
多年来，卫生官员在发现一些常用药物对真菌感染情况几乎无效后，就一直对这种超级真菌的可能出现发出警告。
2019年，医生在纽约诊断出3起病例，这些病例也对一类称作为棘白菌素的药物具有抗药性，该药物被认为是对抗真菌感染的最后一道防线；但在纽约的病例中，没有证据表明感染已在患者之间传播。科学家得出结论是，治疗过程中形成了对药物的耐药性。
不过，美国疾控中心对于最新出现的病例得出结论，这些真菌感染确实进行了传播。
在华盛顿特区，一家专门收治重病患者的疗养院中出现101例感染耳念珠菌病例，其中3例对所有3种抗真菌药物均具有抗药性。达拉斯地区两家医院的感染集群有22人，其中两例具有这种抗药性。
根据美国疾控中心的说法，这些病例发生在2021年1月至4月。在治疗完全无效的5人中，有3人死亡，其中两人是得州的医院病患，另一人在华盛顿。
莱曼表示，两地的病例都在持续爆发，自4月以来还发现了其他感染。但新增病例尚未被报告。
调查人员查看了医疗记录，没有发现这些集群中的患者以前使用过抗真菌药的证据。卫生官员表示，这意味著它们会在人与人之间传播。"

Look at above dealings, ever heard about the "" call wolf stories "" ? it is a nuisance to see our major institution is using our very own money to manipulate the market and milking the retailers who are the same time, her very own paymaster.
At first she was making SBL disposal to enjoy interest from the loaner and at the same time buying more share at cheaper price by engaging the RSS troop to sell down the stock, and while instead of paying those monkeys for the job, she is getting double payback from those monkey with interest and divvy from Kossan if any.
Now, she is making SBL accquisition while disposing the cheap stock collected earlier. my goodness, what a despicable institution in boleh land

（华盛顿30日讯）一项研究显示，即使已经完成接种新冠疫苗，但只要感染了Delta变种病毒，患者体内仍可携带大量这种病毒，美国疾病控制与预防中心（CDC）是基于此数据，而修订了口罩指引。
CDC本月27日发布更新指引，建议民众在冠病传播率“高”或“明显”的地区，即使是已接种新冠疫苗，在室内也必须戴上口罩。目前，全美有三分之二以上的县是“病例激增地区”。
CDC主任瓦伦斯基日前表示，研究表明已经完成接种的疫苗者，若受到Delta变种病毒感染后，可发现他们的喉咙和鼻子里携带了大量这种病毒。
这项研究发现，与感染了早前版本新冠病毒的完成疫苗接种者，情况完全不同。据科学家观察，多数感染了早前版本病毒的完成疫苗接种者，似乎无法把病毒传给他人。
最新研究的结论对美国人来说是一大打击，因为这意味著即使已经完成疫苗接种，如果自身的免疫防线遭Delta“突破”，即便这些人没有出现任何症状，仍可能会和没有接种疫苗的人一样，具有传染性。家中有孩童、年迈父母或其他免疫力弱的亲友的完成接种者，必须再次提高警惕，尤其是那些居住在高传播率社区里的人。"

https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2021/08/07/comfort-i...
Recently, Hartalega Holdings Bhd’s earnings report for the first quarter (Q1) of financial year 2022 (FY22) exceeded all analysts’ consensus by a huge mile. An institution-centric foreign bank which gave Hartalega a target price of RM5 prior to the results being announced, admitted that he underestimated Hartalega’s average selling price (ASP) by a whopping 53%. Later, the analyst increased his earnings’ forecast for FY22 by a huge 65% in his report. However, he maintained the lower target price of Hartalega despite being completely wrong in the first place. His justification of his flawed analysis was stated in the headlines of the report “The future matters more than the past.” When earnings beat your forecast, you cannot then upgrade future earnings forecast but maintain the same target price. It defies common sense. This is precisely why retail investors at times feel frustrated and suspect the stock market is rigged against them."

2021年08月14日
（吉隆坡14日讯）在澳洲证券交易所（ASX）上市的丁腈手套制造商VIP手套宣布，正式获得美国食品和药物管理局（FDA）批准，在美国营销丁腈手套。
该集团周五发文告指，这是自上月获得FDA医疗产品许可证临时批准后，刚通过所有程序的最新进展。
该集团近期也向澳洲药品管理局（TGA），申请在澳洲销售丁腈手套。
董事经理杨振家（译音）表示，FDA的批准使该集团能够在美国市场销售产品，同时申请TGA也能进军新市场和扩大市场范围。
文告指，目前该集团持有FDA与欧洲合格认证（CE），可在美国和欧盟销售产品。
该集团子公司位于雪兰莪厂房，主要为手套业者代工生产（OEM）和供应丁腈手套。

BBC报导，验尸官迪尔克斯根据夏莉莎的就诊纪录等资料发现，她一直身体健康，4月29日接种了第一剂AZ疫苗，随后出现严重头痛，因此在5月13日被送往北杜罕大学医院接受治疗。不过，治疗并未减轻她的头痛，症状在5月16日变得更严重，甚至没办法开口说话。
医生为她进行扫描后，发现她的脑部出现血块，为了减轻脑部压力而切除部分头骨，惟她的病情持续恶化，在5月21日逝世。
迪尔克表示，经过解剖与病理分析后，证实她的死因为极罕见的“血栓性血小板减少症”，会导致大脑肿胀与出血。
神经病理学家波尔维科斯基在夏莉莎死后对她进行了检查，并表示“她的身体健康，没有任何医疗问题，她死于血栓和脑部出血，实在令人惊讶，时间上似乎很可能，她的死确实是疫苗引起的”。
验尸官迪尔克斯表示，“这状况极为罕见，但我也同意波尔维科斯基的判断，她死于接种AZ疫苗后的并发症”。
英国药品与保健品监管局首席安全官凯夫表示，该局将尽速审查验尸官的裁决，“对大多数人来说，接种AZ疫苗的好处远大于它所带来的风险，因此人们仍应尽速接种疫苗”。

The biggest threat and uncertainty faced by rss is the recent issue raised by the PM advisor on rss ban. Current nett rss for topglov is 221 million share. If u look at the daily trade volume, this is around 4 times trading volume of last friday. But if u look at the thin sell queue, rss could not cover back on time. They could only cover back unless there is fear and panic sell.
Let me quote that in detail, say 3 days before the rss ban, nett rss is 221million share.
Each sell q is 5000 lots (500, 000 shares)
The rss will need to buy up rm 4.42 from the curent rm 3.06 ie rm 7.48
But there is a limit up ceiling where trading will be halted.
RM 3.06 x 1.3 = rm 3.90
Rm 3.90 x 1.3 = rm 5.07
Rm 5.07 x 1.3 = rm 6.59
If price shoot up a lot, rss will shortsell even more entering a viscious cycle of loss making.
Then, they will shortsell even more aggressively to bring down the price, till a point where ministry of finance will need to announce rss ban even quicker than used to plan.
Any big local fund who has the bullet should realize that topglov is an opportunity, and retailer must unite and resist fear and temptation to escape.
We call this, close the gate, release the dogs, start to punish rss.

Konan88 Surely, the shortseller will not be happy with this, but this is THE BIGGEST FEAR faced by different shortseller union. The unity shown by different shortsellersi s equally fragile in front of MR MONEY. I have send my message to Datuk Seri Najib facebook on his outstanding speech on rss ban. Rather than fighting the sharks with weak retailers, get the government in for a fair game."

（吉隆坡21日讯）前首相拿督斯里纳吉建议，政府应该出台计划，鼓励民众购买股票，以刺激大马低迷的股市。
他说，马来西亚今年的股市是全球第二低的股市，股市虽然在上个月政府更迭后有小幅上涨，但大马交易所今年仍是全球第6低。
他说，相信与其他国家相比，马来西亚股市被低估了，因为经济开始重新开放，而且原产品价格和制成品的出口仍然强劲。
“这也意味著，我们有机会让所有马来西亚人，共同参与我们的经济复苏。”
他说，此时股价处于低位，这意味著有许多公司支付的股息高于银行的实际服务费用。
他指出，目前3年期定期存款的年利率仅为 1.9%，而许多蓝筹股票，如国能 (4.1%)、马来亚银行 (5.6%) 和顶级手套 （5.7%），预计将支付更高的股息 。

（上海24日讯）中国多地积极推动“能耗双控”（同时控制能源消耗总量和强度）政策，各类高耗能、高污染的行业被迫限电限产，而波及范围明显扩大，更多上市公司发布公告披露相关影响，除了钢铁、水泥、化工等高耗能产业，光伏等行业也开始受波及。
《上海证券报》周五报导，今年8月，国家发展和改革委员会在例行新闻发布会上直接点名9个省份：青海、宁夏、广西、广东、福建、新疆、云南、陕西、江苏，上半年能耗强度同比不降反升。此外，还有10个省份的能耗强度降低率未达到进度要求，全国节能形势十分严峻。
面对能耗双控目标考核，多地下发能耗双控的政策文件，对高污染、高能耗企业实行限电，云南、江苏、新疆、广西等地还对能耗双控举措进行了加码。
随著“能耗双控”政策执行纷纷落地落实，限电限产措施在多个省份密集推出，“双高”企业轮番接到限产通知。企业与相关产业链都受到波及。目前，10多家上市公司发布公告，披露当地政策带来的影响。
根据该报记者采访了解到，目前，限电限产的范围不仅涵盖前期的钢铁、水泥、化工等高耗能产业，也开始涉及其他行业。"

It’s now the second antiviral pill behind Merck’s to demonstrate strong effectiveness for treating Covid at the first sign of illness. If cleared by regulators, it would likely be a game changer in the ongoing global pandemic fight.
Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told CNBC the company plans to submit its data to the Food and Drug Administration before Thanksgiving.
“I think this medicine will change the way things are happening right now that will save millions and millions of lives, it has the potential to do it,” Bourla said in an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” He said the company has “the capacity right now of 500 million pills,” which he said translates to 50 million treatments. “The very high efficacy comes even to us as a surprise, exceeds our most visionary expectations we had for that.”"

Although average selling price uncertainty lingers, valuations have turned attractive with all three glove makers trading at EV/share below pre-pandemic levels.
MQ Research names Kossan as its top pick within the sector. Read on for MQ Research’s order of preference and target prices in an excerpt of the report dated 19 November 2021. Also, check out the associated Macquarie warrants over the glove names below.
Negatives are priced in
Incoming China glove supply threatens Malaysian manufacturers’ market share. However, MQ Research believes these negatives are priced in as share prices have now fallen 70-75% from pandemic highs. MQ Research believes large-cap Malaysia glove makers have a 25-35% production-cost advantage over China peers. MQ Research initiates on Malaysia’s glove manufacturers as valuations turn attractive despite average selling prices (ASP) in flux. All three glove makers in MQ Research’s coverage are trading at an enterprise value per share (EV/share) below pre-pandemic levels. If shares decline a further 10-15% - which MQ Research believes to be the absolute bottom – MQ Research sees an attractive entry point. ASPs are quickly declining (currently US$35-40 vs. mid-21 US$85-90 per ‘000 pieces), and MQ Research’s top pick Kossan’s differentiated product mix shields it from potential global oversupply. Kossan is trading at a steep discount to peers (post-pandemic PER discount to TopG/Hartalega of ~15%/ 50%) and at about half their pre-pandemic EV/share.
Production cost advantage over China/new entrants
China: MQ Research estimates that China glove manufacturers currently have 25-35% higher production costs vs. large-scale Malaysia manufacturers due to higher fuel and labour costs. If global oversupply occurs, and prices continue to decline, MQ Research believes Malaysian large-scale manufacturers will be the last to turn unprofitable. However, MQ Research expects China producers to continue to add capacity until costs normalise despite downward pressure on margins.
New entrants: MQ Research expects newer entrants in glove manufacturing to quickly become unprofitable as ASPs dive below production cost. Newer glove producers have an estimated production cost of US$35-40 per ‘000 pieces (vs. existing players of US$20-23). MQ Research believes newer players will either abandon expansion plans or exit the industry altogether.
Post-pandemic supply-demand outlook
Frost & Sullivan expects disposable glove demand to deliver a 15.9% volume compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) post-pandemic (2019-2025F) vs. 8.2% pre-pandemic due to increased hygiene awareness. MQ Research forecasts China producers to account for 24% of global supply post-pandemic (2023E) vs. 10% pre-pandemic (2019). MQ Research expects long-term ASPs to settle at US$24-26 per ‘000 vs. street estimates of US$25-30 on increased price pressure from China manufacturers. This is structurally higher than pre-pandemic prices of US$20-22 due to higher social compliance costs.
Valuations are now compelling; Kossan is MQ Research’s top pick
MQ Research uses a price-earnings ratio (PER) methodology to value glove manufacturers, applying MQ Research’s target multiples to post-pandemic FY23E/24E earnings per share (EPS) – years when MQ Research expects ASPs to stabilise. MQ Research’s multiples of 15x-21x represent between a -1.0SD to -0.25SD discount to pre-pandemic sector/company historical averages. Post-pandemic ASP uncertainty and labour practice issues linger. MQ Research’s order of preference is Kossan (OP) > Hartalega (OP) > Top Gloves (N).

HART MK: RM6.30 based on a PER methodology

Earnings per share had also declined to 2.98 sen, from 7.78 sen from a quarter ago. The Management foresees further softening of glove ASP, especially in the nitrile

Its a fundamental change in the whole supply n demand equilibrium of glove biz with China's presence.

Some said China's ASP is 30% lower than Msian...i dunno how true it is...if so the gap shall be further reduced in near future.
Its either China's ASP will go up or Msia's price shall come down
Any further drops of ASP (say 10% to 20%) will hv very serious impact to glove co's bottom line (stay profitable).

You are comparing New producers punya new Mercedes with old producers punya 20 year old Kancil
Who will win?
New producers will have better fully automated equipment.
This results in better tolerances, higher yields, better quality and much lower cost of production.
New producers have a higher capital sunk cost but that is not important coz new producers can throw lower prices.
All other factors are not relevant.
=> The war is won on lower production cost and a quantum jump in better quality.

The overcapacity in glove sector is going to be very serious in undermining the profitability of glove producers for years to come. New producers suffer the most. Traditional producers who aggressively add substantial new capacities will not get return to the capital investment."

外电美东时间周六报导，皮莱谈及，他最近平均每日都要接诊几十人，但患者于染上Omicron后，病症相对Delta来的轻微。患者于确诊感染Delta时，出现呼吸困难等症状，不少人因此需入院治疗，但如今感染Omicron的病患多半皆是轻微的流感型症状，譬如咳嗽与身体酸痛。
皮莱提及，患者可居家隔离控制疫情，大部分病患于10到14天隔离期内就可能复原。尽管Omicron症状相对Delta轻微"
