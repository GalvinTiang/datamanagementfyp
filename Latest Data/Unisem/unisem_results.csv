and see today's price, if market think that the deal will go through, the price will not be here. it should be at least 3.20. because few days ago 2 out of 3 preconditions has fulfilled.
and looking at annual report, not much shareholder is holding more than 5%. all are long term investor. they want to keep it in fridge instead of realizing the profit.
some might even bought at 3.90. you think they will cut lost?"

Since many investors are holding for long-term, their cost are definitely lower than 3.90. The easiest way is comparing annual report of previous two year to see the change of shareholdings.

At 10.30am, the counter had pared some gains at RM5.50, still up eight sen or 1.48%. The counter saw 694,600 shares change hands. Its share price has exceeded the target prices (TPs) of most analysts covering the stock, except for MIDF Research which pegged the stock at RM5.86 since the company showed a strong earnings recovery in its results for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2020 (3QFY20). Earlier on Oct 26, MIDF upgraded Unisem to ""buy"" from ""hold"", and raised its TP to RM5.86 from RM3.10. The research house also revised upwards its FY20-22 earnings estimates for Unisem to RM135.4 million-RM204.7 million due to higher revenue assumptions for all of its market segments, with the exception of the automotive segment, which in turn led to healthier profit margins. CGS-CIMB Research, which reiterated its ""add"" call with a higher TP of RM5.50 (previously RM4.25) for Unisem, also raised its FY20-22 earnings per share (EPS) forecasts by 17%-24% to account for higher utilisation and new capacity expansion. “Unisem is entering a multi-year growth phase driven by strategic portfolio expansion for radio frequency, power management and sensor products,” it said. Meanwhile, Affin Hwang Capital, Kenanga Research, Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB) Research and KAF Research, also with ""buy"" calls for the stock, have TPs ranging between RM4.25 and RM5.21."

i. 1stly, our biz world will be based on WASTE.ECONOMY forever, n depending on SEMICON.
the smart IT young fellows will n have a way to change n replace the old way of doing biz.
EX: the super successful AAPL n MSFT models that grow in the last 15-20 years, will duplicate n continue growing ON .,.
the 1st version of iphone was so good, the 2nd n 3rd n, n, r better .,.
Consumers r forced to throw away their old iphone or any smart phone to buy the latest version.
Imagine, 5G is more happening n is just getting started!
EV.car is the next big ticket item for us all = HUGE semicon biz ahead for generations to come .,. .,.
TECH n more TECH biz to do for many years to come driven by
a. QUANTUM COMPUTING,
b. 5G,
c. IofT,
d. EV.car
All these biz products n services have an expiry date dictated by the tech innovators.
Consumers have to constantly spend n UPGRADE...
ii. TECH : OSAT n EMS stocks, mostly reported their record high in their latest QR PAT.
Earnings at new high mean the growth is at the new BEGINNING ...
iii. Where is the location of TECH stocks now on their financial mountains?
We saw a big MAJOR A = primary school level in TECH.
The MAJOR C, the secondary school has started only 1.5 weeks ago.
VALUE of MAJOR C is always > MAJOR A.
The LOCATION is @ mini wave b of minor i of MAJOR C = b.i.C
TECH r having a mild PROFIT.TAKING SESSION n could complete in 1-3 more mkt days.
OSAT: UNISEM, INARI, MPI couldn't wait n r now on c.i.C, the 1st course on the table now.
WATCH n focus: So many of them will do the BO this week."

The villagers were very happy, after all there were hundreds of Monkeys in a nearby forest.
They caught the Monkeys and got them to the rich man. He bought hundreds of Monkeys and paid 100 for every Monkey the villagers gave him.
They began to make a living out of getting Monkeys from the forest and selling it to the rich man.
Soon, the forest began to run out of monkeys that were easy to catch.
Sensing this, the rich man offers 200 for every monkey. The villagers were ecstatic.
They went back to the forest, set up traps and caught the monkeys and got them to the rich man.
A few days later, the rich man announced he would pay 300 per monkey.
The villagers began climbing trees and risking their lives to catch monkeys and get them to the rich man – who bought them all.
There were no Monkeys left in the forest!
One day, the rich man announced he would like to buy more monkeys – this time for 800 each.
The villagers couldn’t believe this. They were desperately trying to get more monkeys.
Meanwhile, the rich man said he had to go back to the city on some business work and until he returns his manager would deal on his behalf.
Once he left, the villagers were unhappy. They were making quick and easy money from selling monkeys, but the forest no longer had monkeys.
This is when the manager of the rich man stepped in.
He made an offer the villagers could not refuse.
Pointing out to all the monkeys that the rich man had caged. He told the villagers he would sell the monkeys for 400 each.
“Sell them back to the rich man at 800 each when he comes back” the manager said.
The villagers were over the moon. Buy for 400 and sell for 800 in few days. They had just found the easiest way to double their money.
The villagers collected all their savings and even borrowed money.
There were long queues and within a few hours, almost all the monkeys were sold out.
Unfortunately, their happiness did not last long, as the manager went missing the next day and the rich man never came back.
Many villagers kept the monkeys with them, hoping the rich man would come back. But soon, they lost hope and had to let the monkeys back into the forest as feeding and taking care of the noisy monkeys became extremely difficult.
Good Luck!"

1. Don't chase when it is high or broke a new level. You will be trapped.
2. Buy on dips after breaking a new level. (if you still want to ride it)
3. ALWAYS have a cut loss pricing (at least 10% for a fast moving stock if not you cut too early and it bounced back)
4. Monitor the volume, price action before jumping in or trigger sell.
5. Staying sideline is a position too! (DO NOTHING)
6. If it is not fit to your risk profile, just move on to other stocks. No need to condemn or give negative inputs. Those who are in, knows their risk profile I hope.

(March 7, 2021, 2:00 AM GMT+8 Updated on March 7, 2021, 3:41 AM GMT+8)
~ Growth estimates have jumped in light of recent developments
~ Gains may give some pause on massive infrastructure package
With Democrats on the verge of passing an almost $2 trillion stimulus bill and Covid-19 vaccinations moving ahead, the U.S. economic outlook is much sunnier than it looked in early January.
The latest Bloomberg monthly survey of economists shows the annualized pace of growth in the first quarter will be 4.8%, twice as fast as respondents expected just two months ago. For the full year, gross domestic product is projected to rise 5.5%, which would be the fastest since 1984 and is up from January’s estimate of 4.1%.
After January’s key run-off elections in Georgia, where Democrats secured two Senate seats to win slim control of the chamber from Republicans, economists were generally penciling in a pandemic relief package worth around $1 trillion. Democrats stuck together to push through a bill almost double that size; no Republican senators voted for the plan on Saturday. The measure next goes back to the House for a final vote, expected to be Tuesday.
President Joe Biden, speaking Saturday after the Senate vote, looked for a major boost to the economy.
“This will create millions of new jobs,” Biden told reporters at the White House. “It’s estimated over 6 million new jobs by itself; increase the gross domestic product by a trillion dollars.”
“As tough as this moment is, there are brighter days ahead -- there really are,” Biden said. “It’s never been a good bet to bet against America.”
An additional round of $1,400 stimulus checks for millions of Americans, combined with supplemental jobless benefits and the acceleration in vaccinations, should help sustain growth throughout the year, said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC.

For research reports are considered just personal opinions and not a yardstick for my trading decision. In fact, once they painted a very negative light on Unisem and set a lower price when it was trading at higher price. But in the industry, the recovery was in the pipeline.
If research house starts to give high targets, I will start to be cautious and adjust accordingly.
Example: Unisem price at 7++, Research said 8.00
It doesn't mean it will not go down to 6-7 first, and later only hit 8.00 if company performance is maintained.
In summary, the investors who had first hand access to the data of supply /demand will able to position themselves early into the game.
The swinging action is a heaven for short term traders to take advantage of ups and downs. Medium-long term traders are always caught in it.
That is where the technical analysis can help to at least reduce the risk of being caught or have a better trading plan.
Monitor the movement of shares on daily/hour basis is even more intense but a short term trader has to do that.
So, got to ask, what are own goals for this counter, etc.
In general, I am medium term, but looking at Unisem's trend for past 1 year, I had to adapt and switch to short term trading. Yes, it takes more time and effort, but that is the price to pay if you wish for higher gains in short period while the trend is favorable to the trading plan."

February sales surge semiconductor shares
(Kuala Lumpur 6th) In February this year, global semiconductor sales have surged 14.7% year-on-year, and the month will slightly reduce 1% to $ 39.6 billion (about 163.6 billion yuan).
Dachen analysts said that the latest data showed that monthly, the monthly trend was consistent with a few seasonal trends in February, and the rising rose on the year, it was visible for two consecutive months. February growth and strong wafer demand and orders observed by domestic semiconductor operators were driven together.
The World Semiconductor Trade Statistics Organization (WSTS) predicts that after 5.1% to 440.4 billion last year, this year's global semiconductor sales will further grow by 6.6%, to a record $ 46.4 billion.
From the individual areas, most regional economic slowdown, resulting in a micro-falling 1% in February. Compared to year, China, Asia Pacific (excluding China) and Europe rose 18.9%, 18.2%, and 6.8% respectively, all more than January, but promoted sales in February 14.7% year-on-year. This also offset a negative effect of 9.7% and 7.6% of the United States and Japan, respectively.
The shipments have new high
At the same time, in February, the shipments rose 3.2% monthbook, and 32% increased from year to 31 billion US dollars, and the history is high. This also recorded monthly growth in the third consecutive month, as well as a year-on-year increase in the 17th consecutive month; strong increase in strong demand for semiconductors throughout the terminal market, as well as global digitalization accelerated development.
Since semiconductor sales reach a record level last year, the wafer factory has increased capacity to meet global needs, and semiconductor shipments are expected to grow further this year. In addition, including the world's launch of the 5th generation of telecommunications technology (5G) equipment, emerging technology development, and China's huge investment in the wafer factory, will also drive the semiconductor demand.

Silicon: Semiconductor shortage impacting automotive industry
Posted 19th January 2021 in Industry news.
By Nils Backeberg
According to Reuters, automakers around the world have been caught off-guard by a shortage of semiconductors that has required the industry to compete against the consumer electronics industry for chip supplies. Leading semiconductor manufacturers reassigned capacity from automakers after the pandemic cut down vehicle sales, instead shipping chips to companies that produce smartphones, gaming systems and other electronic goods that remained in high demand.
Several companies, including Volkswagen, Nissan, Ford, Toyota and others, have been impacted and are struggling to secure the chips to maintain production lines. All chips, whether bound for a laptop or a vehicle, start life as a silicon wafer, an industry that has always struggled to keep up with sudden demand spikes.
Roskill View
Polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon) is used in the production of silicon wafers. Polysilicon remains only the third-largest end-use for silicon metal worldwide, however, it has been the fastest growing of the three major applications for silicon metal in the past two decades with its share of global demand rising from 3% in 2000 to 20% in 2019.
Silicon metal is consumed directly in the production of poly-crystalline silicon wafers for use in photovoltaic (PV) solar cells, and indirectly in mono-crystalline silicon wafers for use in semiconductors for integrated circuits and a range of electronic equipment. Until 2007, the production of mono-crystalline silicon wafers for use in semiconductors was the largest end-use for polysilicon. The consumption of silicon metal in polysilicon began to take off significantly after 2009, fuelled in part by generous subsidies for producers and consumers of solar products in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. By 2019, the proportion of global polysilicon demand accounted for by semiconductor applications had fallen to just 16%.
Though Asia accounts for about 70% of global silicon semiconductor wafer output, China remains a relatively small player with a market share of about 15%, in contrast to its dominance of the solar value chain. The leading producing countries are South Korea, Taiwan, the USA and Japan, with over 50% of supply consolidated into the five largest producers.
The rapid advancement of technology both drives and restrains the demand for silicon chips and wafers, and the constantly changing balance of these influences has led to a haphazard growth over the last decade, while silicon wafers in the solar industry have enjoyed a consistent growth. Looking forward, Roskill forecasts that the solar industry will continue to drive growth in demand for silicon metal with double digit increases in demand to 2023. Moreover, while semiconductor demand as a whole is expected to remain in the low single-digit growth rates over the next decade, the impacts of COVID-19 are already indicating a haphazard growth year in 2021."

The main driver for Malaysia’s export performance in Feb 2021 was the Electrical & Electronic (E&E) Products sector which increased its exports by 25.5% from RM25.1b to RM31.5b on a year to year basis. Export of Refined Petroleum Products and Palm oil and Palm Oil Based products grew by 6.1% and 10.4% respectively. Interestingly, the increase in Refine Petroleum Products was driven by an increase in export volume (+58.7%) because average unit value (or price, in layman’s language) actually fell by 13.2%. On the other hand, the increase in palm oil exports were driven by the increase in average unit value (+26.7%) even though export volume dropped by 14.3%. (These trends are worth monitoring moving forward) It is likely that the E&E sector in Malaysia, which had a good year last year (MCO 1.0 notwithstanding) will continue to experience a healthy growth in 2021 especially as economic growth in the United States picks up and the effects of the massive US$1.9 trillion stimulus package is felt on the ground. Malaysia’s E&E sector most certainly benefitted from the US-China trade war with some amount of production transfer taking place from China to places like Penang and to a lesser extent Selangor and Johor. While the E&E sector will continue to face challenges in the labour market (like many others in the manufacturing and construction sectors), the trajectory for this most important sector of the economy when it comes to our export figures is definitely positive moving forward.

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000751.jsp?ftp=90","Apr 29, 2021 10:05 AM","quahsb","Unisem’s 1Q21 core net profit of RM45m (QoQ: -32%, YoY: -RM6m in 1Q20) was in line. Although top line gained sequentially, bottom line was weaker attributable to unfavourable sales mix, higher manpower cost and D&A. 2Q21 revenue outlook is guided to be +5-8% QoQ as order visibility remains robust. Chengdu is expected to see stronger growth ahead and contribute about 55% to the group over Ipoh’s 45%. Reiterate BUY with unchanged TP of RM9.88, pegged to 33x of FY22 EPS.
Within expectations. 1Q21 core earnings of RM45m (QoQ: -32%, YoY: -RM6m in 1Q20) matched our and street full year estimates at 23% and 21%, respectively. This is deemed to be in line considering seasonal weakness. 1Q21 one-off items include inventories write-down (+RM69k), forex gain (-RM445k) and grant income received (- RM275).
Dividend. None (1Q20: None).
QoQ. Despite unfavourable forex (1Q21: RM4.06/USD vs 4Q20: RM4.11/USD), top line gained 2% on the back of higher sales volume achieved. In USD term, sales expanded by 3% to USD92m. However, core earnings shrunk by 32% to RM45m due to (1) unfavourable revenue mix (higher contribution from lower-margin leaded and leadless products); (2) higher payroll costs due to salary increment, bonus and newly hired 250 operators in Chengdu; and (3) higher D&A (+4%).
YoY. While impacted by less favourable forex (1Q20: RM4.17/USD), top line gained 37%, mainly driven by higher sales volume. From continuing operations, sales actually strengthened 47% (50% in USD term). Bottom line turned profitable from 1Q20’ core loss of RM6m as Unisem was impacted by Covid-19 disruptions in Ipoh and Chengdu while winding down Batam plant.
Chengdu. Utilization rates remain high in both wafer bumping, assembly and test. It has awarded contracts for construction of Phase 3 building with target completion in Sept 2022.
Ipoh. Utilization rates are wafer bumping in UAT is low due to wafer shortage. Assembly and test is optimal except wafer level packaging.
Outlook. 2Q21 revenue is expected to be +5% to +8% QoQ (in USD term) with good order visibilities across all market segments. Contribution split between Chengdu and Ipoh in assembly and test is 55:45 and the former is expected to see stronger growth.
Forecast. Unchanged.
Reiterate BUY with unchanged TP of RM9.88, pegged to 33x of FY22 EPS. Despite trade war and Covid-19 risks, Unisem’s prospect has improved with (1) closure of loss-making Batam plant; (2) favourable forex; (3) gradual synergistic relationship with TSHT; and (4) healthy balance sheet."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000751.jsp?ftp=91","Apr 29, 2021 10:07 AM","quahsb","1QFY21 CNP of RM45.8m (+761% YoY; -25% QoQ) is in line with our/street expectation at 20/22% of full-year estimate. The QoQ drop is due to hiring costs and new equipment added to cater for overwhelming orders for subsequent quarters. Unisem is optimistic, expecting high single-digit QoQ growth in 2QFY21 on the back of strong demand for wafer bumping in its Chengdu plant and WLCSP which command higher margins than normal leaded/leadless packages. Phase 3 expansion in Chengdu will commence soon with completion expected in 2H 2022. Maintain OUTPERFORM with an unchanged TP of RM10.00.
Within expectations. In the quarter that is typically it’s weakest, this best ever 1Q CNP delivery of RM45.8m (+761% YoY; -25% QoQ) met our high expectations representing 20% and 22% of our and street’s full year forecast.
YoY, 1QFY21 revenue surged by 47% to RM373.9m (+50% in USD terms to US$91.9m), as the group registered higher loading volumes for all its packages across the board due to pent-up demand for semiconductor chips.
QoQ, 1QFY21 CNP fell 24.8% to RM45.8m despite a 2.1% increase in revenue to RM373.9m. The larger quantum of decline in CNP could be explained partially by the 4.4% higher depreciation cost as new equipment was added to the facility. In addition, there was an increase in payroll cost with newly added 280 new operators and technicians in Chengdu plant post-Chinese New Year holidays coupled with upward adjustments in salary to retain and incentivise its workforce.
Bright prospects. The group indicated that the margin impact from the newly added staff will be temporary as the extra workforce is well needed to accommodate the overwhelming demand in its Chengdu plant, especially for wafer bumping and wafer-level chip scale packaging (WLCSP). Phase 3 expansion in Chengdu is expected to commence very soon and will be completed by 2HFY22, which will double its current floor space. While Ipoh plant is experiencing strong orders in other packages, its bumping facility utilisation rate is relatively lower than Chengdu as its American customers in Ipoh did not manage to secure enough wafers. That said, the group is optimistic that the roaring demand in Chengdu will be able to offset the temporary shortfall until bumping orders return to Ipoh site strongly in 3Q or 4Q 2021. To capitalise on that, Unisem is also revisiting the idea of building a plant in its 32 acres land in Gopeng.
Maintain FY21E and FY22E CNP of RM235.3m and RM254.6m.
Maintain OUTPERFORM with unchanged Target Price of RM10.00 based on higher FY21E PER of 31x at +1.5SD to 3-year mean.
Risks to our call include: (i) weaker-than-expected USD/MYR, (ii) slower-than-expected adoption of 5G, and (iii) worsening US-China trade war.

TECH Theme.play seems on going... n at earliest stage I guess .,.
The ranking of most competitive TECH on KLSE now r :
# 1 MPI
# 2 D&O
# 3 GREATEC
# 4 UNISEM
# 5 UWC
The 2nd tier/class has lots to catch up in prices like
UNISEM, FRONTKN, INARI
NB : at final analysis in each cycle, only 2 to 4 best stocks will give us all the BEST profits. n some stocks on sympathy play would rob our gains, avoid them at all cost.

every stock has memory of its past.
UNISEM had PP in 2 tranches bcos funds can't take 100% in 1 go.
about 60% of PP was cut at 560 n months later with TECH bull run, the 2nd tranche was placed out at 750.
The side effect of PP is some of these fun could sell for a small gain n thus slow or delay the flying high process.
BUT it can fly fast as its paid up is considered small. a bit of patience is required. it has potential to fly 10% up a day.
This is my 4th stock in the confidence of diversification."

While most mining isn’t done at home, China dominates the processing of chemical materials that go into batteries. It accounts for 65% of the production of anode materials and electrolytes and 42% of cathode materials, according to Goldman Sachs.
“China in general has a stronger grip on supply chains than anyone else, so they should be better positioned,” says Adam Panayi, managing director at research firm Rho Motion.
That could translate into cost savings for China’s favored EV scions, although it also creates strong incentives for other countries to develop their own processing capacity. In the meantime, some of the froth from batteries is starting to flow back upstream."

(SMIC) and Tsinghua Unigroup, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an association of mostly advanced economies. Other countries subsidize semiconductor fabs through cheap land and tax breaks, but only China provides so much aid in the form of this cheap equity, the OECD said.
Whether China’s spending is effective remains controversial. Chinese chip companies remain well behind leading Western competitors. Mr. Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies estimated China has injected between $49 billion and $72 billion into state-owned aircraft maker Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) in a so-far-unsuccessful effort to make it a competitor to Airbus and Boeing.
Even if other countries spent as much as China, they would likely struggle to achieve truly independent supply chains because China dominates so many of the links. When semiconductor chips are fabricated in the U.S. they still must undergo assembly, packaging and testing, a low-margin business where China is the biggest player.

Therefore, our short term price target would be RM7.5. Long term downside: RM4.5 as earnings normalise."

Unisem is scheduled to release its 3Q21F results on 26 Oct. To recap, the group guided for 5-8% qoq US$ sales growth in 3Q21F in spite of the initial 11-day plant closure in Jul-Aug. However, we believe the second plant closure, which lasted for 7 days, coupled with headcount limits led to lower or even flattish qoq sales delivery in 3Q21F. Nevertheless,
we still think that Unisem will be able to catch up with production in 4Q21F in line with higher vaccination rates among its employees and greater worker availability as more employees return from mandatory quarantine leave. Overall, we believe this should translate into higher utilisation in 4Q21F."
