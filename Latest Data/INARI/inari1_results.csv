"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001951.jsp?ftp=624","Jan 3, 2019 10:59 AM","YiStock","latest apple revenue guidance for december 18 quarter:
1) usd 84 bil. Previous guidance between USD 89b to usd 93 bil.
2) lower Revenue guidance of approximately usd 5bil to usd 9 bil Revenue shortage. And the shortage is 100% due to in china revenue drop.
Key interpretation:
Q4 2017 china revenue, USD 17.96 bil, total iphone unit sales 13 mil unit.
we use usd 9 bil short as benchmark, which means about 50% drop in china revenue. Which may implies a short of 6.5 mil iphone sold in china.
Therefore, q4 2018 total iphone sales should in the region of 70 mil unit globally.
Other factor that may contribute to lower revenue is lower average selling price which due to massive give-back offer by apple globally. As high as 40% discount. Which may generate lower revenue in front of flattish unit sales.
Conclusion: i'm not sure if lower revenue guidance given by apple is traslated to lower loading volume too to its vendors like inari & gtronic since both inari and gtronic has issued unofficial statement saying the volume loading is stable.
More clue will be sought after apple release it official result end of January 19."

苹果公司(Apple Inc)美国时间2日下调2019年财政年度第一季财报，表示是因为升级新iPhone的买气低于预期，以及大中华市场经济放缓。这是iPhone问世以来苹果首度下修财测，公司盘后股价重挫达8.5%。
影响所及，大马上市苹果概念股益纳利美晶(INARI，0166)
及东益电子(GTRONIC，7022)闻声双双急挫。
上半日休市时，益纳利美昌股价暴跌12.93%或19仙，做1.28令吉，半日转手量达5082万股，是全场第5大下跌股；东益电子股价则急退9.88%或17仙，挂1.55令吉，半日转手量为569万股，是全场第7大下跌股。
苹果下修截至12月29日止的第1季营收，从原本预估的890亿到930亿美元下修到840亿美元，大幅低于分析师所预估的915亿美元；这是苹果自2011年库克上任后，首次第4季佳节销售旺季不旺，也是iPhone2007年问世以来，苹果首次针对财报发出预警；消息传出后，原本微幅收涨的苹果，盘后交易一度暂停，20分钟后恢复交易时重挫达8.5%。
苹果首席执行员库克（Tim Cook）在致投资者信函中表示，尽管预测新兴市场会面临挑战，但却未预期到经济放缓程度会如此巨大，尤其是大中华地区；并怪罪中美贸易战紧张局势，影响中国经济表现。
库克在2018年11月财报发表时指出，预期新兴市场，包括巴西、印度和俄罗斯，销售量会低于预期，但特别表示中国市场不包括其中。"

Now Inari share price dropped from RM1.47 to RM1.24 right this moment, dropped by 16%. And look back Inari latest Annual Report, the biggest customer (Broadcom) contribution to Inari revenue is 66%. Even assuming Broadcom order to Inari reduced by 10%, I estimate that Inari overall revenue or profit just reduced by 7% only (66% x 10%).
So, aren't investors over-reacted for the Apple's profit warning?"

Must focus on what the company does next such as its business expansion plans, diversifications, etc. AA's plane sales is being priced in already even the special dividend. The upcoming 5G technology is way more exciting and provides more upside for those companies which will benefit from 5G. I'm sure inari will benefit greatly from it especially after trade deals are settled between US-China. Always remember that Trump is a businessman first and such a person won't want to trade war to persist longer than it should.

From INTC QR yesterday, you see that wireless modem segment is down, directly related to mobile phome segment. Semicon rallied but the direct risk to INARI business, i.e. lower mobile phone component demand is still intact.
I guess it was a trade opportunity, but investors would be wiser to wait for qr to see if revenue and profits have sustained. I am worried it declines further, then 3 trailing quarters of losses would cheapen INARI PER further.
Disclaimer: I am a long term INARI bull."

geo-economic uncertainties, we see some challenges in our overall business in particular,
the RF segment for the flagship smartphones while the optoelectronics segment continues
to show resilience. For the second half of our financial year, the Group expects to maintain
similar performance from continuing manufacturing activities as the first half, while
continuing to work towards delivering positive performance with focus on managing costs
and margins. This is barring any negative impact from unfavorable forex rates for the Group
resulting from the decline in the US Dollar due to the rolling back of the Federal Reserve’s
previously expected rate hikes in 2019. The Group is also working towards implementing
Industry 4.0 on a bigger scale throughout the entire Group as to achieve greater efficiencies
to drive down the manufacturing costs in the near future.
The mgmt gives some hint for the 2nd half performance this year."

Ignored the TA for the last few days but QR now confirmed it. Sell.
---------------------
sanakimpro So, what pushed INARI up? From INTC QR yesterday, you see that wireless modem segment is down, directly related to mobile phome segment. Semicon rallied but the direct risk to INARI business, i.e. lower mobile phone component demand is still intact.
I guess it was a trade opportunity, but investors would be wiser to wait for qr to see if revenue and profits have sustained. I am worried it declines further, then 3 trailing quarters of losses would cheapen INARI PER further.
Disclaimer: I am a long term INARI bull.

KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 22): CIMB IB Research has downgraded Inari Amertron Bhd to “Hold” at RM1.61 with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM1.65 and said Inari’s 1HFY6/19 results were in line at 49%/48% of house/Bloomberg consensus.
In a note yesterday, the research house said it expects minimal improvement in 2HFY19 due to sluggish smartphone market.
“Core net profit fell 18% y-o-y in 1HFY19 due to lower utilisation following weak sensor and RF demand and unfavourable forex movement.
“Downgrade to Hold with an unchanged RM1.65 TP in view of the recent surge in share price. We prefer Malaysian Pacific Industries Bhd for exposure to the technology sector,” it said.

在历经3年的强劲成长后，今年全球半导体市场增长开始出现缓势，2月销售数据已是继1月下跌5.6%，并写下2年半来首见跌势后，连续2个月呈跌。
SIA总裁兼首席执行员纽佛表示，2月全球半导体销售大范围下跌，所有主要产品环节都录得按年和按月跌幅。
“所有主要区域市场销售也普遍呈跌，主要是全球领域在过去3年录得创纪录营收后，现持续处于销售趋缓的周期。”
以区域来看，所有区域市场都呈跌，其中欧洲、亚太／其他、日本、中国和美国分别按年下挫3%、7.2%、5.9%、8.5%和22.9%。"

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001951.jsp?ftp=642","Apr 12, 2019 9:38 PM","Patrick13","KUALA LUMPUR: Inari Amertron will benefit from the roll-out of the 5G network and infrastructure, UOB Kay Hian Malaysia Research says.
It said on Friday that although FY19 will be a transition year for Inari for both its existing and new businesses, the group’s medium-term outlook remains promising, underpinned by 5G.
“Besides new 5G smartphones (on multifold increase in RF filters), Inari will also benefit from the inevitable growth in 5G infrastructure with its expertise in fibre-optics chips and optoelectronics. Any share price weakness presents buying opportunity. Maintain Buy. Target price: RM1.80,” it said.
UOB Kay Hian Research said while Inari’s utilisation rate for RF testers (42% of group revenue) is only hovering at 60-65%, the group remains committed to its key customer’s capacity expansion plan (testers are consigned by this key customer) which will see additional testing capacity being added by 2019.
“We are particularly positive on this as this implies that Inari’s RF customer is expecting a significant uptick in RF demand, likely from the imminent convergence of 5G, which would also directly benefit Inari given its niche-services in this space.
Samsung’s latest introduction of the Galaxy S10 (5G) kick-started the 5G wave, and other premium smartphone brands will have to follow suit by introducing 5G phones either by this year or latest by next year, despite 5G telecommunications infrastructure still being at its infancy stages.
While 5G phones could have a marginal earnings impact on Inari at the early stages (due to the phones’ high price points), the group’s major customer continuously consigns RF testers to Inari despite the current low utilisation rate of testers at 60-65%.
This suggests this major customer could be anticipating a sharp uptick in RF filters requirements once 5G takes off, which will require a multifold increase in RF filters for smartphones.
UOB Kay Hian Research said aside from Samsung, the US and Chinese premium smartphone players would be following suit and this would also lend strength to Inari’s RF demand.
Besides a multiple-fold increase in RF filters expected in the new 5G smartphones, Inari will also benefit from the inevitable growth in 5G infrastructure with its expertise in fibre-optics chips and optoelectronics.
The research house said time was needed for its new business with a German customer.
“For its existing operation, Inari’s new products ramp-up for this customer, that is, 2D and 3D FR sensors, health sensors, and mini LEDs are still on modest volume.
“With the recent takeover talks by private equity firms alongside lower earnings forecast mentioned in an ad-hoc statement by this customer, we also do not discount the potential slowdown in the new business development between Inari and this customer.
“Note that Inari now expects to obtain the new P34 plant’s (680,000sf) certificate of completion and compliance (CCC) in June 2019 (instead of expediting by April 2019), with the exact timing for the commencement of production still in discussion at the moment.
“All said, we believe Inari is the frontrunner to benefit from the outsourcing model by this customer should the latter adopt such modus operandi to boost its margins,” UOB Kay Hian Research said.

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001951.jsp?ftp=642","Apr 12, 2019 9:41 PM","Patrick13","Despite a tepid year ahead due to lower sales for the radio frequency segment (RF) amid weak smartphone shipment at key end-customers, AllianceDBS Research has upgraded Inari Amertron Bhd to a “Buy” with a higher target price of RM2, from RM1.60 previously, as it views ample upside opportunities moving forward, especially from the introduction of 5G technology.
In a note today, the research firm said while the stock has corrected by 35% from its 2018 peak and its share price might still be dampened by near-term quarterly earnings weakness, this could provide the opportunity for investors to accumulate.
It added that the recovery in the radio frequency (RF) segment — tracking Broadcom’s guidance — and Inari securing new businesses for its new P34 plant in Batu Kawan, should also progressively take place towards end of second half of this year.
“Looking beyond the current transition phase, we believe investors will start to appreciate the 5G growth potential for Inari, once the technology is progressively being ramped up in new smartphone models.
“In our forecasts, we expect Inari’s radio frequency segment to grow by 15%-17% from financial years 2020 to 2021 (FY20-21), recovering from the dip in FY19. This is also partly helped by the expectations that Broadcom would regain the market share that it lost to competitors.
“This should also help to boost Inari’s valuation, which is currently trading at its mean of about 17.5 times calendar year 2020 price-earnings ratio (PER),” its analyst Toh Woo Kim wrote, adding that the higher-than-consensus PER is as he believes its valuation will re-rate, once Inari’s RF segment returns to growth trajectory.
Shares of Inari were traded unchanged at RM1.64 as of writing, for a market capitalisation of RM5.21 billion.

（吉隆坡19日讯）隨著苹果公司（Apple）和高通（Qualcomm）的侵权案告一段落，苹果將加速推出5G iPhone，分析员认为益纳利美昌（INARI，0166，主板科技股）將从中受惠。
大马投行分析员指出，益纳利美昌在苹果智能手机的射频（RF）设备供应链里佔一席之地，而射频设备是5G网络中的必要组件之一，所以苹果和高通和解，对该公司有利。
分析员表示，双方和解意味著苹果会加快採用5G网络的步伐，但时机因素或使苹果要等到2020年才让5G手机面市。
「从歷史记录来看，苹果在採用新科技方面总是落后于同行，比如从3G网络转向4G的时期。」
据外媒报导，苹果因专利侵权一案向高通作出一笔赔偿，並达成和解，同时双方签署为期6年的晶片组供应协议。隨后，英特尔（Intel）宣布，退出移动设备的5G调製调解器（modem）业务。
苹果原本计划从高通与英特尔两方面取得调製调解器供应。不过，由于苹果和高通之间的侵权纠纷，令前者在2018年只能完全依赖英特尔的產品。
不过，依照美国知名商业周刊《Fast Company》近期的报导，英特尔无法在限期前研发出5G调製调解器，而相关设备原定用在2020年推出的苹果5G手机上。
看好2业务前景
考虑到进度落后，也基於政治因素无法使用华为设备，苹果决定和已有成熟產品，即驍龙（Snapdragon）X50和X55的高通和解。
此外，分析员继续看好益纳利美昌，理由是射频、镭射和发光二极体（LED）业务的成长前景。
他表示，手机內部设备增加和5G网络令益纳利美昌射频业务受益，而手机的生物识別与扩增实境（AR）应用增加，亦会惠及其镭射设备业务。
他也称，各大商场对高清电子广告板的需求提高，推动该公司的LED业务成长。无论如何，该分析员目前维持益纳利美昌的盈利预测，因而保持该股的「守住」评级与1.65令吉目標价。益纳利美昌周五略跌5仙或2.73%，以1.78令吉掛收，全天成交量为1434万股。

全球多国积极建设5G电讯网络，但气象专家警告，5G网络可能严重干扰气象专家用来观察大气变化的精密仪器，继而影响天气预报，令重大风暴来袭前的警告不足，恐因此造成人命损失。
根据英国《卫报》及美国《华盛顿邮报》报导，气象卫星上的仪器记录著大气中的水蒸气、降雨、降雪、云层覆盖以及含冰量，这些都是影响天气的关键因素。不过，科学家发现，5G网路使所用的无线射频（Radio frequency, RF），可能会阻挠气象卫星对地球的观测结果。
举例来说，欧洲MetOp探测器为评估大气中的湿度，使用23.8GHz的频段，水蒸气会在这个频率释出微弱的讯号，探测器便能够全天候观察相关数据，以提供气象学家作为气候变化与风暴是否来袭的依据。然而，5G网路的频率与23.8 GHz相当接近，容易与水蒸气所释出的讯号混淆，最后导致气象观测与预测的结果失准。
英国雷丁的欧洲中期天气预报中心专家博尔曼说：“这些数据是独特的天然资讯来源，对我们的预报能力很重要，如果我们失去了这些数据，天气预报准确度将大幅恶化。”
然而，美国联邦通讯委员会仍陆续将接近23.8 GHz的频段拍卖给未来的5G网路供应商。甚至就连其他运用在气象观测的频段，像是用来研究降雨、降雪的36至37 GHz、用于测量大气温度的50 GHz以及用来分析云层和含冰量的86至92 GHz频段，也都包含在美国打算拍卖的频段中。

中国副总理刘鹤率领的代表团9日抵达美国华府，进行第11轮贸易谈判。第一天的谈判已经结束，美国对中国产品调高关税的措施将于大马时间今天(10日)中午生效。
美国总统川普认为与中国的贸易协商进展太慢，日前宣布对2000亿美元中国产品加征的惩罚性关税税率，10日凌晨起从10%提高到25%。
《彭博》指出，美东时间晚间8时40分左右，中国副总理刘鹤与美国贸易谈判代表赖海哲及财政部长米努勤结束晚餐，刘鹤步出大都会俱乐部酒店时面带微笑，但未回答有关会谈情况的提问。
美中谈判10日将继续进行，但消息人士透露，他们对于美中能达成任何有意义的突破不抱持希望。
《福斯》新闻报导，在美中首日会谈无成果后，白宫正朝额外对3250亿美元中国商品加征关税前进，等于对所有中国输美商品全面课征关税。白宫公布的川普明日行程，显示目前他没有接见刘鹤的打算。"

为了避开关税，加上中国劳工成本日趋增高，美国和韩国的手机品牌预计会把生产基地转移至东盟国家。华为占博通（Broadcom）销量的5%左右，而益纳利美昌（INARI，0166，主板科技股）的40%至50%销量则来自博通。
“华为事件将对全球半导体领域带来短期的负面影响。然而，其他手机品牌如苹果（Apple）和三星（Samsung）可能渔翁得利。”
整体来看，他认为在中国以外的半导体业者，都有可能因为贸易战而成为潜在受惠者。不过这些利好因素并不会立即显现，因为贸易战还是会冲击市场的情绪。
他最看好益纳利美昌，并给予该股“买进”评级和1.80令吉目标价。
他认为，当5G网络正式上路后，5G手机对无线频率（RF）的需求将提高，并且带动公司的无线频率业务。

尽管科技领域遭到中美贸易战火的牵连，半导体市场需求也预计萎缩，但分析员普遍相信益纳利美昌（INARI，0166，主板科技股）未来可继续稳健成长。
益纳利美昌周四公布的2019财政年第3季（截至3月31日止）业绩表现逊于分析员预期。其净利按年锐减30.79%，至3819万令吉；营业额仅得2亿5632万令吉，按年滑落21.33%。
首9个月，该公司净赚1亿5432万令吉，按年下跌30.16%；营业额同样减少17.93%，至8亿8219万令吉。
营业额下滑，因为益纳利美昌脱售持股51%的CEEDTec后，这个季度少了这家子公司的营业额贡献。另一方面，传感器销售减少、产品组合改变和较高的折旧摊销费用都导致了该公司净利挫跌。
安联星展分析员指出，益纳利美昌的大客户—博通（Broadcom）主要为中国华为供应网络交换器方面的设备，而不是其智能手机的射频（RF）晶片。
“益纳利美昌的业务从未涉足网络交换器领域，因此中国华为遭美国封杀根本不会直接影响产品销售表现。”
不过，他强调，中美贸易争端升温无疑会导致全球经济放缓，而半导体行业的下滑周期也会延长。
“若中国决定对美国以牙还牙，它可以采取多种方式。而这很可能会破坏现有的科技行业供应链。我们比较担忧这对智能手机销量的影响，因为益纳利美昌的射频业务占了总营业额的45%至50%。”
5G手机有利射频业务
大马投行分析员也有相同的忧虑。他指出，中美贸易摩擦悬而未解，导致益纳利美昌的客户迟迟不下订单，进而影响了该公司的业绩表现。
同时，中美之间针对5G科技的对峙不排除会牵连更广，分析员表示短期内谨慎看待该行业的前景。
不过，达证券分析员却表示，5G科技手机在未来陆续面市，这将有利于益纳利美昌的RF业务，因为5G科技手机中会配置更多RF元素。
此外，他也指出，该公司高于行业平均水平的盈利赚幅和稳健的资产负债表，也是该公司的优势之一。
该公司正在筹备著产能拓展计划，打算在槟城峇都加湾再设一座新的厂房，预期产能会额外增加68%。
有鉴于此，他看好该公司的发展前景。
另一边厢，丰隆投行和兴业投行都指出，世界半导体贸易协会（WSTS）预期2019年半导体市场将萎缩3%，加上贸易战和英国脱欧始终充满不确定性，两名分析员都谨慎看待公司的前景。
MIDF研究分析员则表示，益纳利美昌为了抵消产品销量下跌的影响，正积极实现工业4.0和自动化，以提高营运效率。
“长远而言，我们认为该公司会获得更多的订单，并且能拓展更多元的产品，减少对射频业务的依赖。”
鉴于近期益纳利美昌的股价下跌了不少，安联星展、艾芬黄氏资本和达证券都表示目前是进场的好时机，因此给予“买进”投资评级。

吉隆坡7日讯）美中贸易紧张局势恶化，抑制全球半导体领域。世界半导体贸易统计协会（WSTS）亦再次下调其2019年全球半导体销售预测，但估计2020年将恢复成长。达证券维持国内半导体领域的“减持”投资评级，唯独看好益纳利美昌（INARI，0166，主板科技股）。
达证券分析员表示，4月半导体领域销售仍延续下降趋势。全球半导体销售继续呈下行走势，今年4月按月减少0.4%，按年亦下降14.6%，至321亿美元（约1335亿令吉）。“以记忆体为主的所有主要产品需求皆走低。”年初至今，半导体销售减少14.2%，至1276亿美元，反映因全球贸易紧张局势，令业者谨慎及更严格地管控半导体库存。
世界半导体贸易统计协会亦下调全球半导体销售预测，2019预计下跌12.1%，相比之前预估的微跌3%，主要是受到记忆体产品所影响，其次是大多数主要产品类别的单位数下滑，如光电、感应器、类比晶片。惟，该组织估计2020年将恢复成长5.4%。
出货总值6连跌
从个别区域来看，所有地区的半导体销售额按年继续萎缩。以美国领先下挫29.5%，其次为中国（跌10.9%）、日本（跌10.9%）、亚太区（跌10.7%）和其他区域（跌8%）。
按月比较，销售下跌的区域依序是美国（3%）、亚太平洋或其他区域（2%）和欧洲（1.2%）；而日本和中国则分别成长2.5%和1.8%。
与此同时，4月出货总值为19亿1080万美元，按月微升4.7%，但按年大减29%。尽管按月取得成长，但自2018年6月以来一直处于下行趋势，进而导致出货总值走势相对疲弱，而这也是连续第6个月按年萎缩。
整体而言，分析员维持半导体领域的“减持”投资评级。这反映近期美中贸易紧张局势攀升对全球半导体领域构成短期抑制因素，主因是许多电子和电器产品受到关税措施的影响，两大经济体需求及供应中断或放缓都将影响供应链。
分析员首选益纳利美昌，这是因为其与主要半导体跨国公司的良好关系；其核心射频（RF）晶片亦将受惠于5G智能手机的发展。
分析员给予其他3家半导体公司友尼森（UNISEM，5005）、马太平洋（MPI，3867）和ELSOFT研究（ELSOFT，0090）“卖出”投资评级。

据国外媒体报道，华尔街已经很长一段时间没有如此不看好苹果公司了。受“卖出”股票评级影响，苹果股价美国时间周一下跌2%。周一，罗森布拉特证券(Rosenblatt Securities)将该公司的股票评级从“中性”下调至“卖出”，使得在彭博社跟踪的57名分析师中看衰该公司的分析师总数上升到5人。
根据彭博社汇编的历史数据，这是这家iPhone制造商自至少1997年以来获得“卖出”评级最多的一次。在此期间，苹果于1998年8月发布iMac电脑，标志性的iPod于2001年10月面世。
彭博社的数据显示，苹果的普遍评级评分（衡量一家公司获得“买入”、“持有”和“卖出”股票评级的比例）目前为3.76分——这是华尔街越来越谨慎看待该公司的另一个迹象。该数字也是自2004年以来的最低水平。
围绕该公司的怀疑情绪在2019年呈现日益浓烈之势，它所获得的5个“卖出”评级全都出自今年。今年4月，New Street Research和汇丰银行双双下调了对苹果股票的评级。另外，今年1月，给予该股“买入”评级的公司比例自2004年以来首次跌破50%。
在很大程度上，这种谨慎态度是由围绕苹果至关重要的iPhone产品线在美国市场需求的不确定性造成的。今年1月，苹果近20年来首次下调了营收预期，很大程度上是因为iPhone的疲软需求。苹果的第三财季财务报告预计将于7月30日公布。
彭博社编制的数据显示，苹果2018财年营收有60%以上来自iPhone，约20%来自中国市场。而中国也是苹果产品供应链的重要组成部分。上周，花旗写道，苹果在中国的销售额“可能会减半”，原因是“品牌形象吸引力不如以往了”。
在罗森布拉特证券下调苹果评级的同时，分析师Jun Zhang预计，由于销售趋势令人失望，该公司的表现“未来6-12个月将面临根本性的恶化”。他说，罪魁祸首是iPhone，苹果目前的1000美元手机销量将继续“令人失望”，它们难以复制iPhone过往令人振奋的表现。
他还指出，更糟糕的是，该公司的其他产品也将无法带来足够的助力，因而苹果将无法让营收数据达到投资者的期望。“iPad的销售增长将在2019年下半年趋于放缓，苹果‘其他产品’的增长，比如HomePod、AirPod和iWatch，可能对支撑总营收增长没有多大的帮助。”
评级下调导致苹果股价周一一度最多下跌2.9%。
不过，“卖出”评级增加也难以代表市场对苹果的一种共识。彭博社(Bloomberg)编制的数据显示，目前有多达23家公司建议买入该股，另有21家给予其“持有”评级。
华尔街2019年表现出的谨慎深度并没有真正反映在苹果的股票表现上。相较于1月份的低点，该股已经上涨了40%以上，尽管仍比历史新高低出14%左右。
然而，对于苹果来说，周一的消息并不完全是负面的。正如Wedbush所写的那样，在亚洲进行调查后，他们发现“全球iPhone需求日益向好”。分析师丹尼尔·艾夫斯（Daniel Ives）写道，“尽管整体手机需求仍具挑战性，但在我们的调查中，我们发现苹果供应商的表现略有上升。”他维持其对苹果的“跑赢大盘”评级以及235美元的目标股价。

全球手机出货量今年恐将滑落至17亿4500万支，研调机构顾能(Gartner)预估，今年智能手机销售将衰退2.5%，衰退幅度将创史上最大纪录。
顾能表示，手机若无法提供重要的新功能、效率或体验，用户不会升级，将会增长手机使用寿命；手机使用寿命自2018年开始增长，这趋势将延续到2019年。
高阶智能手机使用寿命将自2018年的2.6年，增长至2023年的2.9年。顾能预期，今年手机出货量将滑落至17.45亿支，将减少3.8%，智能手机销售将衰退2.5%，衰退幅度将创史上最大纪录。
至于5G发展，顾能预估，2020年全球将有7%的通讯服务供应商提供5G服务，拥有5G功能的手机占总手机比重将约6%，2023年5G手机占总手机比重可望达51%。
顾能预期，今年包括个人电脑、笔记电脑与平板电脑等运算装置出货量将约4亿零300万台，加计手机，终端装置总出货量将约21亿4800万台，将减少约3.3%。

特朗普封杀华为 爽翻台厂 5G大爆单
（台北23日讯）原本外界预期明、后年才会正式降临的5G商机，因中美贸易战恶斗，竟意外地提早报到！原本大家预估是明年、甚至2021年后才会发生的事，没想到，从2019年第二季开始，5G订单春燕已提早来报到。
位于台湾新北市林口区华亚科技园区的砷化镓晶圆厂——稳懋半导体，3个月前，其产能利用率仅55％，这个数字即使是对传产业都颇为难堪，更何况是高科技业。但短短5个月，产能利用率蹿升至90％，员工从去年底2600余人，刚刚突破了3000人大关。
“5G订单比我们预估要提早来，量也比预期的大！”稳懋董事长陈进财说：“本来以为今年不好过，因5G才刚起步，没想到许多国家与电信业者对推动5G很积极，让我们基地台与手机订单出现强劲成长。”
稳懋主要产品——砷化镓半导体，是通讯用射频元件的最关键核心。一组射频元件是由数颗功率放大器（PA）、开关、滤波器、低噪放大器等零件组成。不但每支手机需要射频元件，每个基地台也需要射频元件，否则信号没办法传输。
苹果分析师、天风国际证券高科技分析师郭明錤指出，4G iPhone手机，每支需要三颗PA，5G iPhone则至少需要9颗，其中6颗是为了5G讯号传输所用。
5G商机提早到来，一部分还得感谢美国总统特朗普为封锁中国华为的高端半导体产品“禁售令”。华为禁售令非但没有拖累中国发展5G脚步，甚至激起中国更大野心，华为积极地储备存货，针对许多“较难取得”的零组件，甚至备足了一年存货。
产业研究机构Gartner预测，因为不景气，加上中美贸易冲突，全球半导体营收今年将衰退高达9.6％。台积电财务长何丽梅却在第二季法说会中释出，第三季营收可望较第二季成长17~18％好消息。
以此推算，只要台积电第四季营收较第三季成长1％以上，2019年就可望维持在正成长之上，摆脱大环境整体衰退泥淖，其最大功臣正是来自“5G相关晶片订单的强劲成长”。"

May I ask what are the reasons you did not buy Insas when Insas NAPS is RM 2.59, holding 600million+ Inari shares at book value (Not mark to market as Inari is associate company of Insas) and moreover every one cent dividend from Inari is 6 million free cash flow into Insas?

Inari’s FY19 core net profit of RM183m (-31% YoY) was below expectations mainly due to weak EBITDA margin and higher-than-expected corporate tax rate. Declared fourth interim dividend of 1.1 sen per share. Despite the favourable forex, turnover was weaker impacted by lower volume loading and absence of CEEDTec’s contribution post disposal. We cut our FY20-21 earnings forecasts which resulted in a lower TP of RM1.40, pegged to 20x of CY20 EPS. Maintain HOLD."

（台北3日讯）美银美林表示，全球转向5G无线通讯技术，将提供许多引人注目的投资机会，预测2020年和2021年5G智能手机出货量将大爆发，台积电和博通（Broadcom）将成为最大受益者。
美银美林预估，今年全球5G智能手机出货量将达1700万支，2020年增至1.3亿支，2021年再增至3.27亿支。美银美林分析员Simon Woo发布报告指出，射频（RF）晶片供应链企业很引人注意，因他们在5G智慧手机有新的成长机会。
美银美林看好两档5G概念股，其中之一是台积电。Woo指出：“由于近来总体经济吹逆风，我们偏好有主题驱动的个股，可望受惠于即将到来的5G时代和全球供应链转变。台积电是晶圆代工大厂，制程技术居领先地位，预估台积电的ADR（美国存托凭证）还有很大的上涨空间。”
Woo将台积电ADR目标价提高至47美元，较上周五收盘价42.63美元还有10%上涨空间。
美银美林也看好博通前景。Woo指出：“我们预期博通将是5G智慧手机获得广泛采用的受益者，该公司供应5G前传和回传的特殊处理器，该公司将向苹果和三星电子的5G智能机提供晶片。”
Woo将博通的目标价提高至345美元，较上周五收盘价282.64美元，还有22%的上涨空间。"

Thank you if you had bought some INSAS, INSAS is a cheaper entry to INARI.
INARI is well research, covered by local and international IB. Below is IB report from DBS Singapore.
https://www.dbs.com.sg/treasures/aics/templatedata/article/recentdevel...
Despite some possible near-term setbacks, we remain convinced about INRI’s potential on structural demand growth for 5G. We expect the 5G technology to see mass adoption in 2020, which will drive additional RF content in premium smartphones.
Broadcom has also renewed its supply agreement with a US smartphone manufacturer for two more years, providing more certainty on the introduction of 5G and usage of Broadcom RF chips in next-generation smartphone models in 2020.
Maintain BUY with RM1.90 target price (TP) pegged to 21x CY20 earnings per share (EPS). The stock offers a decent dividend yield of 3-4% and is backed by a healthy net cash position of RM421m.
https://bgr.com/2019/09/05/iphone-12-release-5g-upgrade-cycle/
iPhone 5G Apple is expected to launch in 2020 could very well prompt a massive refresh cycle the likes of which we haven’t seen since the iPhone 6 arrived 2014.
https://klse.i3investor.com/blogs/AmInvestResearch/222467.jsp
For the P34 (Block B) plant in Batu Kawan, the company has begun assembly of interior facilities. Its key customer has requested Inari to prepare the extra floor space, in anticipation of more RF assembly (system in package) jobs. Inari expects its RF assembly lines to double by June 2020. We believe the new jobs are catered for 5Grelated devices.
https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/staticfile/366636.jsp
While worldwide sales of smartphones will total 1.5 billion units in 2019, a 2.5% decline year over year from Gartner’s report published on 1 August 2019, our RF division has performed better. In the same Gartner report, the smartphone sales is expected to grow 2.8% in 2020, driven by broader availability of 5G models and service packages. We look forward to continued growth in our RF division driven by higher chip complexity in the new phones
Conclusion: When more telecom company roll out 5G coverage, inevitable everyone need to upgrade to 5G smart-phone in order to enjoy many new technology/application that only available in 5G. INARI is on the path to excellent growth again due to 5G.
Thank you"

全球半导体销售额连续7个月按年走低，欲振乏力，市场分析员相信，在中美贸易摩擦演变为持久战的情况下，大马半导体股项的短期前景依然黯淡。
7月全球半导体销售额按年下滑15.5%，至334亿美元，而年初至今的贸易总额为2287亿美元，按年跌14.4%。按月比较，世界半导体销售额微升1.7%。
半导体数据不佳，多数大马科技股在周四走跌，但科技股大蓝筹马太平洋（MPI，3867，主板科技股），全天起6仙或0.69%，以8.74令吉挂收，名列上升榜第26位。
达证券分析员指出，虽然世界半导体销售按月回升，不过这已经是连续7个月按年走低，仍然处于下行周期中。
“所有主要的半导体领域产品皆出现销售放缓现象，导致年初至今的销售表现失利。”
北美跌幅最大
同时，该分析员表示，以世界各区域来看，欧洲以外地区的半导体销售额皆按月上涨，不过，按年比较，所有区域皆出现销售萎缩。
其中，北美销量按年跌27.8%，跌幅最大，其次为按年减14.1%的中国，接著是日本、亚太（不包括日本）与欧洲区域，分别降12%、11%和8.6%。
此外，分析员称，全球半导体领域的7月出货量虽按月微增0.4%，到20亿3420万美元，但同样按年下跌14.5%，连续9个月按年萎缩。
年初至今，世界半导体领域入账金额为136亿3720万美元，按年跌22%，原因是存储体市场疲软，令业者削减投资。
展望将来，该分析员认为，持久与正在恶化的中美贸易战，依然是短期内主导半导体领域的关键因素，这将继续对科技股的估值带来打击。
中美两国已从9月1日开始，互相对彼此的进口商品加征额外关税。
“对大马半导体股项而言，关键下行风险视乎中美贸易战会否继续延长且恶化，而美元会否走弱，亦是另一重大风险。”
无论如何，该分析员认为，益纳利美昌（INARI，0166，主板科技股）核心的射频（RF）及光纤光学业务，将从5G网络逐渐商业化的趋势中获益，因此，他维持该股的“买进”评级，目标价亦保持在2.05令吉不变。

Are you misleading investors that you are Leno + stockraider?
Do the math. Investing is about choice. You can choose to invest in 1 lot of INARI or 2 lots of INSAS. The math just say if you invest in 2 lots of INSAS you indirectly hold 1.82 lot of INARI and all the INSAS others business, cash, cash equivalent, associate companies, investment and etc.

Inari Amertron Bhd signed an agreement with PCL Technologies Inc to set up a joint-venture to secure, manage and manufacture optical transceivers and other related products in Penang.
Under the shareholders' subscription agreement, Inari Amertron said the entity to be formed will have an initial capital of RM20.85 million. Inari and PCL would subscribe to 30% and 70% stake in the entity respectively, the semiconductor group said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia.
Inari Amertron said the entity will carry out business operations at Plant 34 in Penang or other plants owned by the company.
Inari Amertron also said the proposed subscription represents an opportunity to invest in a business relationship with PCL with a view to collaborating on a good business opportunity.
“Notwithstanding the minority position, the entity will also enable Inari to diversify its earning streams while tapping on the expertise of PCL in the optotronics sector.
“Besides, the entity will carry out operations in Plant 34 or other plants owned by Inari group at Penang, as such rental payable by the entity at the prevailing market rate will generate a source of cash flow and or income to Inari,” it added.
PCL is a company listed in Taiwan Stock Exchange and is mainly engaged in the research, manufacturing and sales of the optical transceiver module.
PCL also provides complete engineering and product manufacturing solution of complex optical and electro-mechanical components. Its product lines include optical transceivers, fiber channels, transistor outline-can (TO-Can) packages and optical sub-assemblies (OSA), widely used in high-speed bandwidth transmission between netcoms, cloud computing, wireless communication and telecommunications equipment.
The share price of Inari Amertron settled unchanged at RM1.73, giving it a market capitalisation of RM5.5 billion. The counter saw some 10 million shares traded today.

Correct In Trengganu offshore fishermen can't go fishing from Nov to March due to rough sea
So they do other task onshore to wait for next fishing season
So NETX after winning Rm19. 7 millions job award from Telekom diversified into electronic payment while waiting for next job bonanza award
Now time is rope for another big one up to few hundred millions
This is our chun chun timing opportunity
AND price also at Rock bottom
Luck is preparation meeting opportunity!!
08/10/2019 1:56 PM
calvintaneng Time is ripe for another Big Job award
08/10/2019 1:59 PM
calvintaneng Telekom still got 2.8 million copper lines to be replaced with fiber optic cables
Copper lines can only serve old tech of 2g and 3g
Copper lines cannot serve 5g
And 4g uses fiber optic cables
5g builds on 4g infrar
So there will still be lots and lots of digital infrar installation for Malaysia
Malaysia already 10 to 20 years behind time compared to China, Korea, Japan and Singapore
Better play catch up faster

Insas - A hidden gem and cheaper entry to Inari
Author: HLInvest | Publish date: Thu, 24 Oct 2019, 9:36 AM
INSAS is a cheaper entry into INARI as it is the parent company, holding an effective stake of 19%. Despite being an associate company, INARI contributed approximately 50% of INSAS FY18-19 PBT while the rest are coming from its financial services and credit & leasing, property investment and development, retail trading and car rental as well as investment holding and trading segments. Based on INARI’s current price level, INSAS RNAV is worth at least RM4.12, trading at a steep 79% discount (refer to Figure 5). Even after applying a 30% discount for its liquidity, there is still a 241% upside to INSAS revised value of RM2.88.
Thank you"

It's...at what level do I buy back/more? Uncertainty caused the fall. The strategic vision is where the profits are.Inari lost a large customer Broadcom. But the same Broadcom unit is going to apple. Apple's demands are larger. So potentially if they maintain the Broadcom's unit's independence,there's a huge upside potential.Sure It could also mean Apple might change supplier but that's unlikely. Broadcom's supply lines are a lot more complex than apple's in regards to intricacy due to where they're located in the value chain.Broadcom isn't Inari's ONLY client either. SO assumption that it would go broke is largely fearmongering. Broadcom's 2 yr contract still holds. Inari has little to fear in the medium term. Yesterday EPF and KWSP bought into it. I doubt they'd be the ones jumping ship.(literally it's stated on the top of this forum). As Warren Buffet said ""Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful"".

Worse case is cut loss loh.....buy 4D you staright away lose money as soon as you collect that betting slip"

1. Now, Broadcom is still in EARLY TALK to sell its business. Its just an EARLY TALK, and M&A success rate is typically low. Not even enter into a negotiation, how do you conclude INARI will lose its RF business?
2. Even if Broadcom sells to Apple, what makes you think that INARI will lose its business? Inari has been supplying to Broadcom for a long period of time. And Broadcom has been supplying to Apple. It means Apple has NO ISSUE on the products produced by INARI, indirectly. What is your basis saying Inari will lose its RF business?

Given that RF accounted for more than half of the Inari revenue, that’s why many local and international funds are disposing Inari shares rather than collecting it!
Outlook of Inari is not as promising as what you can expect!
Technical Analysis (TA):
Candle stick chart shows bearish pattern signals. This pattern predicts that the decline will continue to be even lower, likely triggering huge scale downtrend!
Good Luck folks!"

In terms of market share, Broadcom is slightly a head of Qorvo. The fact that Inari is only concentrated on Broadcom instead of producing for other is most likely due to commercial conflict of interest protection imposed by Broadcom. In addition to that, Qorvo has no reason to sub their production modules out since they have their own production line. The only RF competitor to Broadcom that sub their production works to OSATs is Skyworks. But their market share is tiny relative to Qorvo and Broadcom.
If Qorvo buys Broadcom's RF business over, Qorvo will be the single largest marketshare. The likelihood US Antitrust will block that deal would be pretty high too since it reduces competition ( A good example is Broadcom take-over deal of Qualcomm). Plus Qorvo has no reason to buy over since Qorvo already have a strong footing in BAW filters.
Therefore my guess, the potential buyers will be down to either Skyworks or Apple.
If Skyworks buys over, Skyworks existing OSATs doesnt have the necessary capacity to absorb all Broadcom's order. And why would they disrupt and shift everything to them in the first place? Inari has the proven track record and cost effectiveness. Skyworks would be shooting themselves on the foot if they ever do that for causing disruptions. Instead, i think this could also be a blessing for Inari, as they can now even compete with Skywork's existing OSATs for their orders (= more orders).
If Apple buys over, i dont see why Apple need to boot Inari out, since Apple is a software based company, they will still need OSATs to produce for them. Apple has been working with Inari indirectly via Broadcom since the first Iphone. The longterm relationship and trust they build throughout this year all pens down to their capability and cost efficiencies. Assuming Apple is the new boss for the Broadcom's RF business, Inari will still be Apple's Preferred OSATs (another one will be ASE).
With 5G theme coming in play next year, i dont see why Inari should be shaken."

1. Broadcom Looks to Sell RF Chip Unit. It is a Possibility, Not a Confirmation.?
Broadcom looks to sell the unit at $10 Billion. Broadcom is currently working with Credit Suisse Group AG to find a buyer for its RF unit. First, there is NO ready buyer. Second, a corporate exercise that involves M&A with value of more than $10B, it will take a long period of time, at least 6 months to 1 year for the legal and financial due diligence. And after all, the success rate of M&As is usually low.
Should there be NO DEAL for the sale on the RF Chip Unit by Broadcom, there is NO financial impact to INARI's business.
2. IF Broadcom has sold out its RF Chip Unit successfully, INARI might lose its Radio Frequency business as a Supplier?
First, INARI has proven its capabilities in RF throughout the years based on merit where INARI was awarded as Best Supplier (Best Contract Manufacturers) for 2010, 2015 and 2017.
Second, the Radio Frequency components are in an extremely high demand market, due to faster 5G adoption and potential high volume of 5G phone sales."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001951.jsp?ftp=689","Dec 20, 2019 10:08 PM","Mabel","Third, there are limited OSAT service providers specialising in Radio Frequency with huge production capabilities. INARI's new plant (""P34"") in Batu Kawan with a total floor space of 680,000 square feet was completed in May 2019. P34 is the biggest plant for INARI, in Block B - to cater for spillover RF testers in preparation for future 5G business.
Fourth, switching of OSAT supplier, especailly a Supplier (INARI) who was awarded as Best Supplier for a number of years is not a cost-effective decision, where it would cause a huge disruption to the supply chain.
Potential of More Orders to INARI, either from Existing or New Strategic Owner?
In 2020, we are expecting a faster 5G adoption and huge volume of 5G phones will be rolled out. Qualcomm Inc expects global smartphone makers to ship 450 million 5G handsets in 2021 and another 750 million in 2020, the world's largest supplier of mobile phone chips said."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001951.jsp?ftp=689","Dec 20, 2019 10:09 PM","Mabel","As more global 5G-enabled smartphones will be launched in the global market, Apple in the United States will take the lead in launching 5G feature phones next year, so that global smartphone sales will resume a growth of 2.8% in 2020 to 1,561 million units, especially in 2020. The growth momentum will accelerate in half a year.
Malaysian electronic product suppliers with high exposure in the communications field are expected to include Inari Micro (INARI, 0166, motherboard technology group), Malaysia Pacific (MPI, 3867, motherboard technology group), and UNISEM (UNISEM, 5005, motherboard technology group) will be the winner, with communications revenue accounting for 40%, 33% and 25% respectively."

Insas have nta rm 2.65 based on 693m share that means it total shareholder funds is Rm 1.83b, even if u minus Inari rm 202m the shareholder funds is still at Rm 1.63b or rm 2.35 per share loh...!!
Even inari at lower share price today at Rm 1.64 based 599m share held by insas, its mkt value its worth Rm 982m loh...!! This means we add add additional Rm 1.47 per share to insas on inari, that will give Rm 2.35 plus Rm 1.47 = Rm 3.82 NAV per share loh...!!
On insas profit if u take out inari contribution of Rm 40m, it still give Rm 42m profit to insas....which means a generic eps without inari of Rm 0.06 mah....!! With inari insas eps is rm 0.12 per share mah...!!

1st of all broadcom Rf is a big supporter of apple and inari is a big supporter of broadcom & supplying more than 85% of inari chips to broadcom, surely inari is a very important partner to broadcom.
That means apple side of the business is more than secure since apple is the owner of broadcom RF mah....!! That means apple side of the business Inari is okloh especially with trade war still on going loh..!!
2. The question is whether apple will allow broadcom Rf continue to deal with other phone makers or other phone makers may wary bcos apple is the new owner....the exposure is about 15% to 25% of Broadcom rf business loh..!! That means around 20% of inari business is expose loh...!!
3. Now if we take the worse scenario, if we assume all the rest of phone makers switch suppliers from broadcom rf....that means it only depend on apple alone loh! Apple being the Largest company in world & very innovative, it will continue to growth in the western world & being a supplier to apple u cannot be that wrong mah...!! That means it is ok for inari even it means in the worse scenario Broadcom Rf only supply to apple alone loh....!!
4. Btw in event all the other phone makers switch suppliers bcos apple is the owner, this is highly unlikely scenario bcos of the trade war, the likely scenario is that, they want to hedge their bets of totally relying on the chinese manufacturer mah, in that case Samsung, HTC, Nokia and Japanese Phone Makers will go Broadcom RF & business still can be retained Mah...!! That Means Inari still can get a good share of non apple business from broadcom rf loh...!!"

I dun wanna go in lengthy for self-explanatory.
Firstly: it is just my opinion and not you or others else
Secondly: my stated 'NOW ' is refers to the uncertainty which is not finalised yet, is not a confirmation stage.
Thirdly: pls read it collectly, I invest in the company for its good business prospect, good management, etc. Everyone dun like uncertainties, but it is part of the risk we need to take if you wanna invest in the share market. If you can't even accept the risk, u might as well leave it or put your money into the FD.

Co also not aware of Broadcom direction. If Apple is the ultimate buyer, it would certainly be double ++ for Inari.
I have mentioned that the Eco system for OSAT (outsourced assembly and test) service provider is not easy to switch. Would Co move away from a reliable competent supplier who had won numerous supplier of the year award and seek to try out another OSAT player.
I am inclined to opine that if there is a new owner, it would not be a right business decision to switch vendor and possibily screw up if new vendor may not be as technically competent and reliable.
In Inari industry, Reliability and degree of tolerance of an OSAT previous result will determine its success and continuation of the business partnership.
Both Inari and Broadcom have grown and made advance in technology together and shared the technology development and advancement.
This marriage is not easy to breakout as Inari is providing all the critical support process requirements.
I also understand Inari plants orders are currently at its peak.

For those interests on Inari 2019 AGM minutes:
http://www.inariberhad.com/img/ir/2019%20AGM%20minutes%20(Key%20Matter...
Block A in Plant 34 has been allocated to the customer as scheduled and as of the AGM, we opined that business relationship between Inari and the customer remains intact
A number of potential customers have visited the plant and indicated their interest in Block C. The Company will make the necessary announcement when there is new business collaboration
The new products mentioned are new RF products, higher speed fibre-optic transceivers and 3D facial recognition products
Yes. There are many other products which require5G such as sensors and IOTwhich could be added to the Company’s product portfolio
If the move results in an increase in smart-phone sales, it will be a good development for Inari
We have been working on the IRIS Scan facilities and equipment deployment to Health Sensor, 2D and 3D facial recognition after customer declared the end of IRIS application in their new coming smart-phones. We had successfully qualified the Health Sensor, 2D and 3D facial recognition products and in production mode currently
Presently, our priority is more on the ramping of 3D into the coming newer 5G smartp-hones. We anticipated the IOT contribution should around 8% -10% of the overall revenue stream in FY2020.

￼
The market have full of unofficially rumour about Broadcom decided to sell off one of its largest wireless-chip businesses.
However after we study though and read from varible sources, we find that Broadcom never mention want to sell, and not going to find the right buyer for it.
The chip maker is formally shopping the unit that makes radio frequency, or RF, chips for smartphones. Out of no where many news go and simply interpret Broadcom reported the fiscal fourth-quarter conference call for discuss results, Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan called the wireless businesses “stand-alone franchises” that don’t fully mesh with the company’s other operations.
When this “stand-alone franchises” message come out, all media interpret as Broadcom wanted to sell off the wireless business. It's highly misleading at some point because if may not the true meaning as Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan din't said want to sell it out.
“stand-alone franchises” could mean to let it go IPO, have new management in control which Broadcom can have better focus in other business, which doesn't mean have to fully sell it. Could be only part of it. Especially when "" franchises"" mean for an authorization granted by a government or company to an individual or group enabling them to carry out specified commercial activities, for example acting as an agent for a company's products. So it could be still under Broadcom control !
Worst that when we double check the news press on Broadcom about the fiscal fourth-quarter, there din't mention anything about this stand alone !
https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broa...
￼
Not a single word mention about this wireless business. But positive that semiconductor business is bottoming up !
https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broa...
Out of no where news mention that Broadcom is working with Credit Suisse to find a buyer with the hopes of landing a deal in the neighborhood of $10 billion. This has not been announced by Broadcom or Credit Suisse.
Talking about Selling the RF unit is different: Chips that filter signals for smartphones was a key segment for Avago before it began a wave of acquisitions early in the decade. The business is highly concentrated; Apple Inc. accounted for more than one-fifth of Avago’s revenue before the merger with Broadcom. Apple and Samsung are still believed to account for the majority of Broadcom’s RF chip sales, which also makes both problematic as potential buyers. Apple in particular has plenty of cash and a known desire to bring more of its chip-design work in house, but it is also highly unlikely to buy a business that would continue supplying key components to its longtime rival.
Especially when Broadcom has just sign 2 year contract with APPLE, what for they want to sell it?
https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2019/06/11/broadcom-apple-con...
How about other potential buyer ? Broadcom’s main competitors, Skyworks Solutions only has about $1 billion in cash on its books and Qorvo a little more than half that much. A $10 billion deal way to expensive for them and sharply increase each one’s dependence on Apple in particular. Apple already accounts for more than half of Skyworks’s revenue.
Other strategic buyers face their own challenges just like Qualcomm is ramping up its own RF business but may hardly striking a deal with Broadcom as previously Broadcom just Fail to take over Qualcomm. Foreign company such as Taiwan’s MediaTek and Japan’s Murata would face regulatory scrutiny since a deal presumably would include Broadcom’s domestic chip-fabrication facilities. Intel also has been named as a speculative suitor. However the chip giant’s recent M"

Citadel is a smart man...
Two factors why believe 1.88 is doable...
I saw an Edge write up that Foreign Fund has started to come back two days ago. Hence what Citadel said is highly possible.
2nd is this report from IB...
Inari Amertron has been sold down during the last few sessions. As the RSI dipped, it has become oversold. It may rebound in the coming session if it breaks above the resistance price of RM1.65. If this happens, the short-term target price will be RM1.76, followed by RM1.88. Support is anticipated at RM1.58, whereby traders may exit on a breach to avoid the risk of a further correction.
Trading Call: Buy upon breakout above RM1.65
Target: RM1.76, RM1.88 (time frame: 3-6 weeks)
Exit: RM1.58

I’m a long-term investor. I started building my 4 Boutiques in parallel when I renter KLSE after GE14. As you know KLCI is down about 10 % since early this year. My average margin is a very healthy double digit. This mean my selections have outperformed the KLCI.
Warren Buffet said ""Never invest in a business you cannot understand.”
I suppose everyone have different views in making their respective investments. For me, it is easier if you invest on something that goes in line with the country’s direction and at the same time doing something that will benefits this Country as well as the Global community. I always has this rule of thumb when I made my investments. I do this as it will benefits the people surrounding me and also to the Global Community.
Inari is part of my bigger agenda for my Business Plan for 2020 for Digital Economy...
Digital Economy - I have invested in the following companies
Mabel Technologies (10)
Mabel Telecommunication (4)
Mabel Media (3)
Mabel Banking (4)
Catalyst
Digital transformation will boost between US$100 billion to US$136 billion (RM412 billion to RM561 billion) to the country’s GDP by 2025.
Game Changer includes 5G, NFCP, High Speed Internet, Automation, IR 4.0, Artificial intelligence, IOT, E Banking, E Commerce and Electronic Finance
Currently performance in term of margin:
P1 - Plantation
P2 - Oil & Gas
P3 - Digital Economy
P4 - Visit Malaysia Year 2020
It’s just like an F1 Race between Mercedes Benz, Ferrari, Red Bulls and Maclaren. At this moment I'm feeling really upbeat about 2020

Nah !! Trading stocks is not as simple as it seems. What i can say that he might have met his Midas touch a couple of times and start bragging. Always remember Hubris kills in stock market investing. Never think you can outwit Mother Market in investing, be it stocks, currency,commodities, bonds and etc. It will find a way to screw you up before you know.
All i can say is that Inari's selldown is done with on the 19th Dec. There is a blow off in volume and hence represents the final force selling in Inari. Support looks solid at 1.60. Volume has subsided tremendously and hence forced selling is drying up. Now it's time to buy if some of you dare. Don't listen to all those half past six analysts.
Always remember HUBRIS kills in investing no matter what type be it stocks, commodities, currency, bonds and etc. All i can say is that the performance of this GooShen guy in the long run will not be much better off than you guys."

Just trade cautionary.. Expected RF industr in low for year 2020, no others silicon vendor want to buy, that why Apple have to absorb the RF division business for supply continuity...
Inari business is overly rely on Broadcom, there is a risk when to reconsider sometime!
Broadcom Wireless Chip Businesses Hurt By Underinvestment Broadcom's touch controller and wireless charging business generated $1 billion in sales in fiscal 2019. But Broadcom said it sees revenue falling to $500 million next year. The reason for the decline is the likely loss of contracts for touch controllers.
""There is unlikely to be much interest for this asset among merchant silicon vendors and it could be likely acquired by Apple, probably at a discounted price,"" JPMorgan said.
JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur values Broadcom's wireless chip businesses at $18 billion in total. That includes $11 billion for the RF business, $6 billion for Wi-Fi and connectivity business and $1 billion for the remaining business.
In a report last week, Baird analyst Tristan Gerra said Broadcom's wireless businesses suffered from the company's underinvestment in research and development.
""The downside of R&D underinvesting is becoming apparent, driving the reclassification of original Broadcom's high-value wireless business as noncore,"" Gerra said."

Has been persuading people to sell and sell and sell and sell but to no avail. As said the other day, Inari has seen it's worst days in 19/12/2019. Explosive volume on that day signifies a short term bottom. In fact if you look properly at the chart, there exist a divergence from 04/12/2019 till 20/12/2019. As for now onwards all i can say is that it is safe to buy.
In stock market it is very important to differentiate the advantages between short, mid and long term. All of us want to make money in the short term right? Not buying and holding for umpteen years.As for myself short term is very important because the longer the time horizon going forward the riskier will be your investments. This is because we don;t tend to know what is going to happen in the future.
Take for example i am sure you know what are your plans today, tomorrow or even until next week. But can you predict what are your plans 2,3 4 or 5 weeks from now? No right? So the time factor is very important in investments. If there is an opportunity then we just capitalize on it be it 1,2,3,5 10 or even 14 days. Why wait until sell at the highest price. Nobody knows when is the best price. In other words if your investments beat your benchmarks then sell and take profit. Why wait until 2,3,4,5 or 10 weeks where the risk of it going back down is high !!
Thus,don't listen to all those half past six analysts here that only provide you fellows half the solution."

LOS ANGELES: Broadcom Inc disclosed new agreements to provide components for Apple Inc devices released through the middle of 2023.
The San Jose, California-based chipmaker said it entered into two multiyear pacts “for the supply of a range of specified high-performance wireless components and modules to Apple for use in its products”.
That’s in addition to another similar agreement that Broadcom reached with Apple in 2019. The three deals could generate about US$15 billion in future revenue, Broadcom added."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001951.jsp?ftp=708","Feb 10, 2020 6:26 PM","ribort_kok","w Healthy Is Inari Amertron Berhad’s Balance Sheet?
Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Inari Amertron Berhad had liabilities of RM171.3m due within 12 months and liabilities of RM29.1m due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had RM473.7m in cash and RM235.0m in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it can boast RM508.3m more liquid assets than total liabilities.
This surplus suggests that Inari Amertron Berhad has a conservative balance sheet, and could probably eliminate its debt without much difficulty. Simply put, the fact that Inari Amertron Berhad has more cash than debt is arguably a good indication that it can manage its debt safely.
In fact Inari Amertron Berhad’s saving grace is its low debt levels, because its EBIT has tanked 22% in the last twelve months. When it comes to paying off debt, falling earnings are no more useful than sugary sodas are for your health. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Inari Amertron Berhad’s ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you’re focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.
But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. Inari Amertron Berhad may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the most recent three years, Inari Amertron Berhad recorded free cash flow worth 55% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.
Summing up
While we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that Inari Amertron Berhad has net cash of RM460.5m, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. So we don’t have any problem with Inari Amertron Berhad’s use of debt. There’s no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet – far from it. To that end, you should be aware of the 1 warning sign we’ve spotted with Inari Amertron Berhad .
If you’re interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet.
Thank you for reading."

Broadcom BCM4389 blazes trail with multi-gigabit, low latency Wi-Fi and superior Bluetooth audio experience
SAN JOSE, Calif., Feb. 13, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) today announced the world’s first Wi-Fi 6E client device, the BCM4389. Wi-Fi 6E extends the Wi-Fi 6 standard to support the soon-to-be-operational 6 GHz band with wider 160 MHz channel bandwidths that double Wi-Fi speeds and cut latency in half compared to Wi-Fi 5. The BCM4389 delivers over 2 Gbps of real-world speeds and up to five times better battery utilization, making it an ideal solution for flagship smartphones and future AR/VR devices.
Wi-Fi 6E builds on the rich feature set of Wi-Fi 6, which includes improved performance in crowded environments, advanced roaming capabilities and increased security. This enhancement of Wi-Fi 6 uses new spectrum in the 6 GHz band to deliver multi-gigabit speeds while avoiding congestion with legacy devices. The BCM4389 expands on the accelerated deployment of Wi-Fi 6, delivering a steady, swift and secure consumer experience in tandem with over 150 million smartphones already in the market. With the additional innovations of Wi-Fi 6E, it unlocks high-speed bi-directional video applications and augmented reality. For more on Wi-Fi 6E and 6 GHz Wi-Fi, read our blog here.
The BCM4389 also brings advanced multi-radio technology to Bluetooth. Inspired by sophisticated Wi-Fi communication techniques such as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and beamforming, the BCM4389 improves audio performance and range for any connected Bluetooth accessory. Phones equipped with the BCM4389 will provide a seamless, “glitch-free” audio experience with popular Bluetooth headsets even in congested places such as subway stations.
In yet another first, the BCM4389 utilizes Broadcom’s new tri-band simultaneous (TBS) connectivity architecture to mobile devices. In addition to two main Wi-Fi radios and a MIMO Bluetooth radio, the BCM4389 incorporates a third ultra-low-power independent radio for optimizing Wi-Fi and Bluetooth performance. The three-radio architecture:
Enables always-on Bluetooth discovery for faster pairing with accessories and interference mitigation. Phones and headsets can now pair faster.
Quickly scans for interference-free Wi-Fi networks to connect to while main Wi-Fi radios provide data, voice and video services. Phones seamlessly switch to networks with better Quality-of-Service (QoS).
Improves indoor location accuracy with always-on scanning and little impact on battery life.
Enables the BCM4389 to deliver up to five times better battery utilization than current flagship connectivity solutions.
The BCM4389 will benefit from a full ecosystem of Wi-Fi 6E products, including home routers, residential gateways, enterprise access points, and AR/VR devices. The new 6 GHz spectrum band is expected to be operational in the United States in 2020, and a wide range of 6 GHz enabled devices will be available at launch.
“At Broadcom, we pride ourselves in delivering technology that defines the market. The BCM4389, the world’s first Wi-Fi 6E mobile chip, is no exception since it paves the way for our wirelessly connected AR/VR future,” said Vijay Nagarajan, vice president of marketing for the Wireless Communications and Connectivity Division at Broadcom. “The BCM4389 delivers on the core advantages of the 6 GHz band, multi-gigabit wireless speeds and very low latency. It also represents a paradigm shift in wireless design thinking with technology that brings glitch-free audio experience with Bluetooth headsets, fast pairing with wireless accessories, accurate indoor location, high battery efficiency and other everyday consumer experiences.”
“Wi-Fi 6E momentum is moving very quickly with regulatory changes expected and chipsets becoming available,” said Phil Solis, research director at IDC. “There are many video-related use cases that require shorter ranges that fit perfectly with the many large 160 MHz-wide channels that the 6 GHz spectrum band is capable of supporting.”
PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS
The BCM4389 is a smartphone combo chip. Key features include:
Support for 2 streams of Wi-Fi 6E
Multi-Radio Bluetooth 5 with antenna beamforming
Tri-Band Simultaneous (TBS) architecture including a dedicated background scan radio
Simultaneous dual-band operation
2.63 Gbps PHY rate
Operation in 2.4 GHz and 5.1-7.125 GHz unlicensed band
160 MHz channel bandwidth
1024-QAM modulation
OFDMA
MU-MIMO"

Wi-Fi 6E is an extension to the Wi-Fi 6 standard and it lets devices operate in the 6 GHz spectrum. An additional 1200MHz can be split into fourteen 80MHz or seven wider 160MHz channels, thus offering higher throughputs. It was announced just over a month ago by the Wi-Fi Alliance, but the FCC still hasn’t approved the use of the 6 GHz spectrum. Though, it looks like Broadcom is placing its bets to become among one of the first to adopt it. The company’s new BCM4389 is a WiFi 6E and Bluetooth 5.0 compatible chip with a couple of welcoming features.
BCM4389 uses a 16nm manufacturing process in comparison to 28nm found on its predecessor, BCM4375. If you need a refresher of the brain, the smaller the nanometer manufacturing process of the chipset, the smaller the distance between transistors. This results in faster and more power-efficient operating of the device. BCM4389 also supports Tri-band Simultaneous (TBS) radio which uses the third radio for background scans and checks which doesn’t require much power.
Broadcom also promised Bluetooth improvements, such as two times faster pairing time and the support of BT MIMO. The latter will theoretically eliminate audio chopping on Bluetooth connected devices. BCM4389 also doubles the maximum bandwidth capability to 2 Gbps in smartphones.
Broadcom chipsets are used by companies such as Apple and Samsung in their mainstream smartphone series. I would expect the arrival of Wi-Fi 6E supported devices by next year. FCC approval should also be in place by that time."

https://nr.apple.com/d2s6P1c8B4
Cupertino, California — February 17, 2020 — As the public health response to COVID-19 continues, our thoughts remain with the communities and individuals most deeply affected by the disease, and with those working around the clock to contain its spread and to treat the ill. Apple is more than doubling our previously announced donation to support this historic public health effort.
Our quarterly guidance issued on January 28, 2020 reflected the best information available at the time as well as our best estimates about the pace of return to work following the end of the extended Chinese New Year holiday on February 10. Work is starting to resume around the country, but we are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated. As a result, we do not expect to meet the revenue guidance we provided for the March quarter due to two main factors.
The first is that worldwide iPhone supply will be temporarily constrained. While our iPhone manufacturing partner sites are located outside the Hubei province — and while all of these facilities have reopened — they are ramping up more slowly than we had anticipated. The health and well-being of every person who helps make these products possible is our paramount priority, and we are working in close consultation with our suppliers and public health experts as this ramp continues. These iPhone supply shortages will temporarily affect revenues worldwide.
The second is that demand for our products within China has been affected. All of our stores in China and many of our partner stores have been closed. Additionally, stores that are open have been operating at reduced hours and with very low customer traffic. We are gradually reopening our retail stores and will continue to do so as steadily and safely as we can. Our corporate offices and contact centers in China are open, and our online stores have remained open throughout.
Outside of China, customer demand across our product and service categories has been strong to date and in line with our expectations.
The situation is evolving, and we will provide more information during our next earnings call in April. Apple is fundamentally strong, and this disruption to our business is only temporary. Our first priority — now and always — is the health and safety of our employees, supply chain partners, customers and the communities in which we operate. Our profound gratitude is with those on the front lines of confronting this public health emergency."

There are two stocks which is hot today; EDEN and THRIVEN. Both are linked to TSMY. I decided to go for EDEN. Thriven I decided to put on hold since it is a Property Company and I have already 7 Strong Property Companies under my collection.
EDEN is bought today direct from the buyer backed with NTA RM 0.77 per share, and also upside from this ECRL Kuantan land acquisition. Unlike Thriven which registered a loss recently, EDEN is a very Profitable Company with 4 Consecutive Quarter Profits.
EDEN climbs 38% today

The decline was led by the electronics sector, which had expanded in January for the first time after languishing in contraction territory for 14 straight months.
The Singapore Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell 1.6 points in February, the biggest drop in a month since August 2014, according to data from the Singapore Institute of Purchasing and Materials Management (SIPMM).
The first contraction in three months pulled the PMI down to 48.7, the lowest level since February 2016. A reading over 50 indicates expansion, while a reading below points to contraction.
The electronics PMI fell 2.5 points from the previous month to 47.6, the lowest since December 2012. The decline was also the biggest in a month since October 2012.
This is the first set of data to show the true extent of the hit the economy might take from the outbreak."

Worst Dow drop since 1987, and only -10% because of the circuit breakers that were put to deal with 1987-style plunges. If it weren't for these, I have a feeling 1987 would be second to 2020.
During this week I have invested in great companies at good prices— when they are out-of-favor—dream of times like these. They don't come around very often, but when they do it's time to buy and shout gleefully that you are fortunate enough to live in times when stocks are selling at fire sale prices.
This time, I’m not selling, I will stay on course, everything will be alright by the next 18 months. Recovery by end of this year will be an added bonus.
I've had more fun this week since I re-entered the market right after GE14. It's all been pretty amazing and fascinating. Now, I will sit back and let the management teams of these companies do what they do best: manage.
Remember: Volatility equals opportunity—not risk!
As shared earlier by the team...
Crude oil price has rebound ... Europe equities rebound ... US equities futures rebound ...
As at 7.27pm,
Nymex => 33.16 (+1.66) (+5.27%)
Brent => 35.01 (+1.79) (+5.39%)
Dow Jones Futures spike up to => 22,191.0 (+1106.0) (+5.25%) !
Hopefully, the price of Brent crude oil will stay above USD 40. It is even better if the price can stay above USD 50."

Either we will move onto a post-apocalyptic society or the stocks will make a comeback like every other crisis before this.
If the first one was to happen, there is not much difference between wasting your money on stocks compared to anything else. Even stocking on supplies will not help you on the long run.
However, if the markets recover, like they do all the time, then you would be buying the stocks when they cheap, making you a hefty profit. But this might require a long patience, and unfortunately not many people have that.

KUALA LUMPUR (April 6): In facing these challenging times during the Movement Control Order (MCO) to control the spread of COVID-19, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said delivery services and online marketing could be new ventures for those with jobs at stake.
""During this time especially, many of the people lose their jobs, among the things you can do is (related to) the transportation industry, especially delivery. If you have a car, maybe you can provide a delivery service to your area, so you can create a new job.
""Delivery system is in hand because personal delivery is needed. One job shrinks and another will take its place,"" the former prime minister said in a special interview “MyPerintis: A Morning Tea with Tun Mahathir” broadcasted live through social media.
The programme was run by MyPerintis (Yayasan Perintis Malaysia), a non-governmental organisation founded last year to promote youth activation and a purposeful lifestyle.
He added that there is a demand to enhance the delivery system because many products need to be delivered, hence, delivery service is the key at this moment.
""Delivery system is now necessary because if you cannot deliver, you cannot sell the product. A good delivery system is key.
""Without leaving the house, without going to the shop, you still can increase productivity as you can order anything and pay with a credit card and the thing will be delivered to you. This happens when there is a good delivery system,"" he said.
He also stressed that the cargo industry also must think about how to make full use of this as the issue has grown more than before.
""Before this, not many were using it (cargo/delivery system) but now we can even buy or sell bulky things. Like China exporting health products to another country. So, we need to take advantage of the delivery system as you can market the product to a bigger market, not confined to only our country but the bigger international market,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Dr Mahathir also said there was an increase of people who are using online marketing such as Shoppe and Lazada but unfortunately, not many people were aware of how to make use of online marketing to increase their income.
He said, the people need to learn how to do online marketing and how to improve their productivity through digitalisation and other new technologies but these require some teaching.
""We have a lot of young people in Malaysia who are very good in business and they must tell people... step by step how to digitalise their market or product. But now we can teach them through the internet. We don't have to meet the people because on the internet you can see everything that needs to be done.
“For example, if you want to learn about the engine, you can show exactly how this is done repeatedly via the internet. From that, you are able to learn a new skill, do a thing that you have not done before and earn money through from it via the internet and online marketing,"" he said."

Director selling isn't always a bad sign. Company used to reward employees with esos. That's REWARD n there's nothing wrong to ex it n sell in open market. Besides, the directors might have top up money to meet margin call lately. Since share price has risen to acceptable level there's nothing wrong to sell some to recover the money."

While others r still using 7nm chips Apple 5G phone is using 5nm chips. 80% increase in density, 15% faster n 30% less energy consumption. In other words the smaller sell volumn is offset by the more sophisticated components. Phone producers earn less but not necessarily true for chips makers.

Apple Inc.’s most important manufacturing partner recorded a 89% decline in net income to NT$2.1 billion ($70 million) in the first three months of 2020. Revenue slid almost 12% to NT$929.7 billion, according to Bloomberg News’ calculations based on previously reported monthly sales numbers.
The earnings decline drove home to extent to which Covid-19 and the resultant global lockdown has chilled electronics demand and driven up costs for upstream producers like Hon Hai that had to adapt to supply chain disruption. Global shipments of smartphones fell at their fastest rate on record in the first quarter, hitting the assembler’s sales even though its main production facilities managed to return to full seasonal staffing levels around mid-March.
On Friday, Hon Hai, known also as Foxconn, said it incurred costs related to the pandemic of NT$10 billion, though some of that will be compensated by the Chinese government. It added it had put the worst of the slump behind it and revenue should recover to double-digit sequential growth this quarter. But the company, which gets half its sales making iPhones and devices for Apple, warned smartphone demand remained uncertain.

Production at many of Apple’s Asian partners ground to a halt after efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19 kicked in. That resulted in severe shipping delays for devices and led to component supply bottlenecks. Consumers also sheltered at home, hammering retail sales. At one point, Apple shuttered all 42 retail outlets in China, a critical market for the company, followed by store closures in other countries. While shops in China have reopened, most of its international ones have not.
Covid-19 has also delayed product development and launches. Apple’s four upcoming redesigned iPhones with 5G will come out several weeks later than usual -- but still within the fall window -- Bloomberg News has reported. In May, Apple failed to provide a forecast for the first time in more than a decade.
Foxconn has already slashed its 2020 revenue projections in the wake of the pandemic. It told investors in April that it still has time to help Apple launch new iPhones in time for the holidays, but cautioned the schedule could be disrupted if the pandemic persists.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Hon Hai’s sales pressure from the coronavirus pandemic, U.S.-China trade disputes, smartphone-market weakness and a broader slowdown in tech spending won’t abate quickly and will likely mean a w-shaped sales recovery through 2020, even as its Chinese manufacturing gets back to full seasonal capacity.

Likewise same with other counters. Today KLCI rally and I missed a golden opportunities to trade...
Hopefully tomorrow the system behave better..

Big part of Inari's earning comes from optoelectronics which is lackluster at the moment. It will dilute the anticipated incremental earning from 5G related RF. Thus I opine Inari fundamentally will not break RM2.00 in short future. New investor should buy Inari only at <<<1.70.

Of course, processors won't be manufactured in Inari as only a few companies in the world has wafer fabrication capability. Even China cannot manufacture high density silicons.
Apple's PC market share is around 13.6%. If all migrate to Apple's in-house ARM processors, Intel will lose 13.6% in sales. But the rise of Huawei in PC market can easily make up the loss in Intel processor's shipment as Huawei's PC is very strong in China.
Inari is also a beneficiary of 5G products from TSMC (likely from Huawei).
Inari pretty much really depends on TSMC. You need to check out TSMC share price to predict the future of Inari.

More so, RF filters is expected to register the steepest demand growth among the RF chip segment as filtering unwanted signals become even more crucial in the 5G phones. Unsurprisingly, Tangren is so keen to acquire Aemulus' IP rights of its RF tester, which is expected to capture the next explosive demand growth in terms of RF testing requirement.
♦️With 3QFY20 turned profitable on the maiden contribution from its RF and CMOS tester, Aemulus is set to ride on a long term growth story, piggy riding on giants like SMIC and other big Chinese OSAT players as well as the burgeoning 5G chip testing requirement. At a conservative MYR10m profit (protected by the growing IP licensing fee), Aemulus' 25x FY21 PER is undemanding versus its peers like Vitrox and Pentamaster which trades between 35-50x PER.

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001951.jsp?ftp=740","Aug 4, 2020 7:57 AM","Lee Kok Wee","Aemulus stands out as a key beneficiary to the worsening US-China ties as Beijing poised to wean off dependency on US by producing up to 70% (from current 20%) of its chip demand domestically by 2025. Its 20-years JVA with Tangren (Aemulus 40:60 Tangren) was a key milestone for the company's expansion story in China. Tangren is not any tom dick and harry as they are indirectly owned by SMIC, which in time will be China home grown wafer foundry to rival giants like TSMC, noting that SMIC will likely be Huawei's dominant chip supplier (phasing out from TSMC) given mounting US restriction. Hence, Tangren will hold sway over how SMIC and its value chain select its tester equipment, which indirectly will benefit Aemulus over the long run."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001951.jsp?ftp=740","Aug 4, 2020 7:58 AM","Lee Kok Wee","♦️The symbiotic partnership will see both parties benefitting from the technological integration (front to back-end equipment supplier) and market share gain for the tester market in China and abroad. While Tangren specializes in the more front - end processes like the chips packaging machines, Aemulus forte lies in the back - end equipment like the testers. More importantly, the JVA also will be earnings accretive for Aemulus given that Tangren will be paying MYR3.4m for the transfer and use of Aemulus' IP (Intellectual Property) rights of its radio frequency (RF) tester."

Wait till Inari qtr 4 come out and see results
And wait till Apple share split.
As I said ..last 3 working days is profit taking and shares changing hand ..-0.12 is good .
If keep going up without profit taking I will be worry.
Qtr 4 should be good.
Apple 5 G .phone ..will start selling Sep or middle October?
Part of Inari production RF should have arrived
In USA for the 5g mobile phone for the launching
Cannot be past minute manufacture and assembly of phone ...procurement and assembling of latest 5 G phone take at least more than one month ahead.

Inari closed at RM2.06 which is above 0.236 fibonanci line (RM2.04) for quite a few days. This could indicate that this support line (RM2.04) is very strong and effective. Besides, multiple hammers candlesticks can be spotted just above the support line. It might be signal for the ending of retracement. Furthermore, Inari is still on a up trend as the trend line has not been broken yet. The trend line shall act as the second support line after the 0.236 fibonanci level (RM2.04). The trend line will be valued at RM1.92 on Monday. Please note that trend line support point will increases day by day. So as time goes, the support point of the upward trend line will increases. There is no buy and sell recommendation. That's all. Cheers.
Thank you.

Compare to the 3 analyst from respectable banking house estimation profit ?

And where is our bonus ..
They have guideline to follow ..
While the rest like us..no guideline ..
We have own stragety..
I personally look at chart and trade future value.
What is future value for Inari .
5G ...RF..price spike...for Inari .
Once Apple declare 5G phone launching date.
And price fly...then
Yes dont forget to take profit by then..
Inari qty is negligible ..wait big fund come.

On Wednesday, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives reiterated his outperform rating on Apple and boosted his price forecast from $515 to $600. His new target price represents potential gains of roughly 20% for investors, based on shares' current price near $500.
Ives sees as many as 350 million people upgrading to Apple's upcoming iPhone 12 model -- which is expected to include much-awaited fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology -- over the next 18 months. The analyst says this iPhone supercycle is a ""once in a decade"" profit opportunity for Apple -- one that many investors are not yet fully appreciating."

Apple AAPL ’s new phones will be rolling out a bit later than they did during last year’s cycle, but the company is expected to have devices in stock heading into the holidays.
People are increasingly holding on to their smartphones for longer periods of time, and the most important question for Apple investors is whether 5G connectivity will be enough to drive a big wave of upgrades.

It is easy for Netx to get free money just by printing shares and cash out to the public getting money indirectly from them; and then RI to get directly from them again.
So, how much the company raise from RI and how much cash they have in hand wont help their business progression; bec their interest is not there, they only take the listed company as a cash cow, continue milking the public for their leisure lives. They are just legalised robber."

Inari is our preferred pick to benefit from the mass deployment of 5G
networks and increasing sales of premium 5G smartphones. Our earnings
forecasts are unchanged at this juncture, but we raised our TP to
MYR3.40 (+95sen), based on a target 36x CY21E PER (at +2SD) to reflect
the strong near-term earnings growth prospects and our expectation of a
sector re-rating. We rolled forward valuation from 28x FY21E PER (at
+1SD). Medium to long-term growth is supported by on-boarding of new
products/customers and M&As. Inari is our Top Pick for the hardware
technology sector.
Capacity expansion denotes strong demand
We have a strong earnings growth outlook for Inari due to its RF (radio
frequency) division. Inari has 22 SiP (system in package) assembly lines,
after adding six new lines in 1QFY21 and eight in 4QFY20. This denotes a
favourable, sizeable demand outlook from its key RF customer
(Broadcom) and expectation of the end-customer’s strong sales of their
new 5G smartphones. We believe there are also possibilities for
additional capacity to be installed in the near future in the P34 plant.
Notably, Inari’s current RF utilisation rate is about 90-95%.
Earnings forecasts unchanged
Our FY21-23E earnings are unchanged at this juncture. Earnings growths
(5-80% YoY) should be mainly driven by the RF division which is projected
to contribute 51-53% of the Group’s FY21-23E revenue. Elsewhere, Inari
has a healthy FY20 net cash of 17sen/share and FCF of 7.9sen/share
which support future dividends and potential M&A activities.
Risks if 5G deployment is slower than expected
Slower-than-expected deployment of 5G networks globally and lower 5G
smartphone sales of leading brands could represent earnings downside
for Inari, as it would lead to lower demand for Inari’s RF filters. There
are also potential earnings risks at its optoelectronics division,
particularly if there’s a prolonged slowdown of the automotive industry."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001951.jsp?ftp=776","Nov 24, 2020 12:00 AM","Mr.Sm Invest123","KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 23): Maybank Kim Eng has upgraded Malaysia’s technology hardware sector to positive from neutral as they believe the sector will ride an imminent upcycle that appears to be heralded by positive growth of the global semiconductor industry.
In a note today, the research house’s analysts Kevin Wong and Gene Lih Lai said they adopt a positive growth outlook for the tech sector due to rollout of 5G networks, ramp-up of semiconductor components and equipment, development of sub-sectors such as Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) and electric vehicles (EVs), and Industry 4.0.
“These should bode well for Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSATs), automatic test equipment (ATE)/automation manufacturers and electronics manufacturing services (EMS)/precision engineering companies,” they said.

Meanwhile, the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics projected that the global semiconductor market will grow by 6.2% year-on-year to US$452 billion in 2021 while the global industry association SEMI estimated that global semiconductor manufacturing equipment sales will grow by 11% year-on-year to US$70 billion in 2021.
“This upcycle would also be driven by the rollout of 5G networks across key cities — accelerated by the growing number of 5G-enabled devices (i.e. smartphones and IoT) and high adoption rates of 5G by key countries (i.e. China, US and South Korea),” they said.
They expect semiconductor equipment component and module suppliers, OSAT companies and ATE manufacturers to be key beneficiaries of such a favourable outlook, attributed to rising supply and demand for advanced chip sets and components (i.e. sensors).
“This, in turn, would also lead to higher spending and stronger demand for semiconductor equipment,” they added.
They also anticipated growth from up-and-coming tech sub-sectors — namely IoT, EVs and AI.
“Although such sub-sectors would [be deemed] to be more niche (relative to the larger core semiconductor market), we believe there are selective opportunities for semiconductor equipment/ATE manufacturers while the booming of any tech sub-sectors would generally entail demand for components and chipsets.
“Elsewhere, we believe the progressive transition into Industry 4.0 would benefit automation companies,” they said.
While the Malaysia technology universe is trading at an average forward price-to-earnings ratio (PER) of 35 times, they think the rich valuations are justified by the potential earnings growth catalysts and upsides, in tandem with the sector’s upcycle, as well as strong domestic equity fund flows.
Inari Amertron
************[[[[[[[[[ Their top pick is Inari Amertron Bhd as they expect the company to benefit from the mass deployment of 5G networks and increasing sales of premium 5G smartphones.
They have raised its target price (TP) to RM3.40, from RM2.45 previously, based on a target 36 times 2021 PER, to reflect the strong near-term earnings growth prospects and their expectation of a sector re-rating.************************************************************]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
They also upgraded Globetronics Technology Bhd to buy from sell as they believed the worst will be over in FY20 and growth prospects will improve from 1HFY21 onwards.
They have increased its TP to RM3.30, from RM1.95, based on a higher re-rated 32 times FY21 PER.
Meanwhile, they downgraded Greatech Technology Bhd to hold, as they believed most of its near-term positives have been priced in at this juncture.
They, however, raised their FY21 to FY22 earnings for the group by 24% to 28% and revised up their TP to RM8.90 from RM7.20, based on an unchanged 36 times FY21 PER.
They also maintained their sell call on ViTrox Corp Bhd due to lofty valuation.
However, in tandem with their sector upgrade and their expectation of sector upcycle, they have raised their TP for the group to RM11.60, from RM8.80. The TP is based on a higher re-rated 37 times FY21 PER."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001951.jsp?ftp=778","Nov 25, 2020 10:50 AM","Mr.Sm Invest123","KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 25): Analysts have upgraded Inari Amertron Bhd to a ""buy"" as they expect the firm's earnings growth momentum to continue on strong fifth-generation (5G) smartphone demand.
RHB Investment Bank Research’s analyst Lee Meng Horng said in a note today Inari Amertron's Q1FY21 core earnings of MYR77.2 million exceeded his expectations on stronger-than-expected volume loadings and margins.
“The strong results set the mark for a better year in FY21 – this should persist in subsequent quarters to meet the growth and content for 5G smartphones,” said Lee, who favours Inari Amertron as a proxy to the growing 5G segment.

Post results, Lee increased Inari Amertron FY21 to FY23 earnings by 11% to 15.4% after factoring in stronger volume loadings and margins from the radio frequency (RF) business.
Lee, who upgraded Inari Amertron to buy from neutral, also revised up its target price to RM2.87 (from RM2.35).
CGS CIMB’s analyst Mohd Shanaz Noor Azam also said that Inari Amertron Q1FY21 results beat expectations, making up 32% of his FY21 forecasts due to higher-than-expected RF output utilisation.
“We expect its earnings growth momentum to continue on the back of new system-in-package (SiP) line capacity expansion and robust demand for new 5G smartphones,” he said in a note today.
He also raised Inari Amertron FY21 to FY23 earnings per share by 4% to 20% to reflect higher sales volumes.
“We expect Inari Amertron’s earnings to recover in FY21F, driven by higher demand for its RF chips on the back of the new 5G smartphone launch by a North America-based smartphone player,
“In addition, we expect a stronger sales recovery from Amertron Philippines in FY21 on the back of new customer wins; the plant is scheduled to begin mass production for its new customer in 2HFY21,” he said.
He upgraded Inari Amertron to add, and revised up its target price to RM3 (from RM2.35).
Meanwhile, MIDF Research’s analyst Foo Chuan Loong revised Inari Amertron FY21 to FY23 earnings estimates higher to between RM297.7 million to RM391.5 million, after the group’s results beat his expectation.
“We input higher revenue contributions primarily from the RF segment given the positive traction on 5G. In addition, we also expect the opto division to perform better due to the group’s effort to diversify its customer base,” he said in a note today.
Post his earnings adjustment, he derived a new target price of RM2.96 (previously RM2.05) on Inari Amertron.
“Moving forward, as the impact of Covid-19 dissipates, we view that the group’s volume loadings would improve greatly. This would primarily come from the RF segment as Inari is a close proxy to 5G,
“Operationally, we also expect the profit margin to improve continuously arising from various measures to control costs and capex. All factors considered, we are upgrading our call recommendation to buy from neutral previously,” said Foo.
At 10.11 am, Inari Amertron rose 7 sen or 2.83% to RM2.54, valuing the company at RM8.35 billions"

good demand in our RF business during the current quarter. We expect a similar demand

with 5G frequency bands requiring additional RF components over 4G ones.
Barring any sudden deterioration in the global economy, the Group is positive on the
earnings for FY2021 due to the strong demand in our RF business. We will continue to
improve production capacity to meet the continued growth in 5G mobile phones over the
next few quarters; improve utilisation of existing capacity in opto-electronics and other
business units, and invest in automation in areas of improvement to drive better margins

Inari reported its strongest-ever headline profit in 1Q FY21 underpinned by strong demand for RF filters as its northern US-based smartphone client introduced 5G into its entire model line-up this year. With clear order visibility over the next 2 quarters, Inari is set to benefit from the 2.75x increase in its assembly capacity. Growth catalyst is likely to come from its Korean smartphone brand and contribution from the business in Philippines and its JV in the equipment business, which we have yet to incorporate into our model. We forecast a FY20-23E earnings CAGR of 49% and recently raised our 12-month TP to RM3.33, based on 35x CY21E PER. Downside

The biggest problem now is that many sifus are still promoting tech stocks although the PE is sky high. After waiting for two years since Sino-US trade war, profits still nowhere to be seen in these tech companies that justify the current price.
Tech stocks rose in the last two years were due to ID4 and expected many China factories will move to Malaysia or products to be manufactured here and repacked before shipping to USA to avoid the 25% import tax.
If Biden can successfully win the game of throne, China will be waived from the 25% import tax? Or will get higher tax?

根据Yole的分析，从2G到4G，射频前端单机价值量增长超10倍，而从4G到5G，射频前端单机价值量的增长将超过3倍。其中，滤波器的需求量增长最明显，市场空间翻倍。PA主要用于对发射的射频信号进行功率放大，若5G增加信号发射链路，就一定需要增加PA。但是因为PA带宽较宽，可以多个频段共用，比如采用多模多频的PA，从绝对数量上来看，PA的用量虽不及滤波器那么大，但价值量也有较大提高。根据Yole的预测，PA的价值量将由2018年的44.5亿美元增加到2022年的50亿美元。
对于全球射频前端市场，Yole给出的预测是，将由2017年的151亿美元，增加到2023年的352亿美元，年复合增长率达到14%。由此可见，5G技术的升级和变化对射频前端的器件数量和价值量的影响是无比巨大的。"

--------------------------------------------------------------------
週四 (17 日) 投資銀行 Wedbush 根據供應鏈調查顯示，5G iPhone 的需求越來越樂觀，明年可能最高出貨 2.5 億部 iPhone，輕鬆擊敗 2015 年創下的 2.31 億部歷史紀錄。
根據蘋果供應鏈調查結果，美國投行 Wedbush 首席分析師 Daniel Ives 重申 iPhone 12 啟動超級週期的論點。
Daniel Ives 稱，蘋果多年來沒像今年發布新機一樣拉動 iPhone 銷售上升趨勢，唯一類似的場景是 2014 年發表 iPhone 6 的時候。
Daniel Ives 對亞洲的 iPhone 進行了供應鏈檢查，圍繞 iPhone 12 的 5G 需求看漲，鑑於當前趨勢，目前甚至超過了我們在 2021 會計年度的牛市情景。
Daniel Ives 研判，目前預計第四季 iPhone 出貨將達到 9,500 萬部，比早前 Wedbush 和華爾街預測高出約 35%。
Daniel Ives 預測，保持假期旺季的牛市態勢，蘋果 iPhone 出貨量將在 2021 年超過 2.4 億部，最高可達 2.5 億部，這是一個令人震驚的數字，將輕易打破 2015 年 2.31 億部的銷量紀錄。
Daniel Ives 樂觀表示，未來幾個月，iPhone 12 超級週期繼續對蘋果股價帶來大利多，維持目標價 160 美元，預計牛市情形下股價將達到 200 美元。
受此消息影響，蘋果 (AAPL-US) 盤中股價上漲 0.39%，暫報每股 128.30 美元。"

EVERY YEAR THERE IS ONE OR TWO THEMATIC BULL THEME AND MANY AS HIGH AS 50% SPECIFIC UNIQUE SPECIFIC STOCK RALLY OF ABOVE 50% MINIMUM GAIN loh..!!
IF WE CAN CATCH IT EARLY & RIDE THE BULL TO ITS PEAK WE WILL DO EXCEEDINGLY WELL WE WILL BE ABLE TO OUTPERFORM IN A FEW SHORT BULL RUNS AND PERHAPS RETIRE EARLY LIKE PETER LYNCH LOH!
OF COURSE LIKE WARREN BUFFET MAKING MONEY FROM STOCK MARKET AS A MOTIVE IS LONG OVER IT IS THE JOY, THE ADVENTURE & THE CONSTANT INTELLECTUAL CHALLENGE IN THE ART OF INVESTMENTS THAT CAUSED HIM TO SAY
""TAP DANCING TO WORK""
NOW MY HUMBLE OPINION FOR INDIVIDUAL STOCK PICK THIS
YEAR 2021 WILL BE INSAS ""THE COMING SUPER INDIVIDUAL STOCK BULL RUN""
WHY INSAS WILL GO INTO A BULL RUN FOR YEAR 2021?
ANSWER:
BECAUSE INSAS SHARE PRICES NOW REACHING SUPER EXPLOSIVE INFLEXION POINT WITH THE POTENTIAL EXPLOSIVE OUTBURST TO ITS ALL TIME HIGH DUE TO POTENTIAL AMPLIFY PROFITS TREND INSAS GOING TO ACHIEVED DUE TO ROBUST STOCK MARKET , INVESTMENT GAIN & THE STRONG SHOWING OF technology INARI LOH!
AND IF PROFITS KEEP INCREASING IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME OF INCREASE WILL INCREASE DIVIDENDS OR REWARD WITH BONUS ISSUES.
SO INSAS SHARES MUST GO UP HIGH AS THIS IS THE LAW!
TECHNOLOGY STOCKS, GLOVES STOCKS, FINANCE STOCKS ARE GETTING MORE VALUABLE IN WHICH INSAS HAVE EXPOSURE TO ALL OF THEM LIKE TECHNOLOGY THRU INARI & OMESTI, GLOVES THRU DGSB AND FINANCE THRU INSAS CREDIT & LEASING, M&A STOCKBROKING & ADVISORY AND SHARE INVESTMENT THRU INSAS HOLDING & SUBSIDIARIES ALL THESE EXPOSURES WILL REAPED IN SUPER PROFIT FOR 2021 MAH!
FOR YOUR INFORMATION INSAS ALREADY RECORD SUPER PROFIT FOR THE 1ST QTR 30 SEPT 2020 RECORD PROFITS OF RM 65M, EVEN THE WHOLE MSIA ECONOMY REGISTERED NEGATIVE GDP GROWTH LOH INSAS amazingly gain loh!!
LOOKING AT THE TREND OF INCREASING PROFIT FOR INSAS, ITS SHARE PRICE WILL EVENTUALLY SHOOT UP IN TANDEM LOH!
AGAIN WHEN ALL THE WORLD MARKETS ARE STARTING TO RECOVER FROM YR 2020 COVID19 SETBACK, U WILL SEE MAJOR RALLYS DUE TO RERATING OF STOCKS AND SUPER LOW INTEREST RATES enviroment THAT wii SPURS EQUITY PURCHASE MAH!
INSAS BEING SUPER UNDERVALUE WITH NAV OF RM 4.80 AND PE 8X WILL BE THE MAJOR PRIME BENEFICIARY here mah!
U r actually seeing emerging sign of INSAS share at 88 sen starting to run up like the early SUPERMAX & TOPGLOVES Gloves run in March to April Rally, the sign of coming bull which are very subtle with explosive upside b4 it explosively burst out with gains of few hundred % at the later stage mah...!!
U need to join the Insas stock early, as this is a safest fruit pickings when there are still abundance in supply now loh...!!
ALWAYS REMEMBER TO BUY INSAS 88 sen EARLY BEFORE TOO LATE MAH...!!"

IN INSAS AT RM 0.90, U CAN SEE TRANSPARENTLY ITS FAIR VALUE LOH...!!

""Simple"" calculation insas has asset of at least RM 4.50
which can ""Easily"" generate 30-50 sen eps.
which can ""Easily"" yield a 10-20 sen dividen per year.
Paying 90 sen for RM 4.50 asset ? u don't want ? Why ?
Paying 90 sen for 30-50 sen eps ? PE 2 or PE 3 ? Double every 2-3 years ? Don't want ? Why ?
DIY 10-20% ? Still don't want ? Why ?
U rather pay 90 sen for 10 sen asset ?
Or pay RM 6 for RM 2 asset ?
Or pay 70 sen for 2 sen eps ? compare to 90 sen for 20-30 sen eps ?
why ?
At the end, it is okay to do what you want.
Leno has seen company with ""90 sen asset"" selling at 45 sen, and when the company announce they are going bancrupt, meaning asset 0 sen, the share price ""DROP-UP"" to 90 sen ! HAHAHAHAHAH ... how can a counter price go up 100% when company declared bancrupt ? It is a crazy market. Of course the company went bancrupt, and got delisted at the end. The company name is LCL ... anyone still recalled LCL ?
Anyway, leno still wish everyone all the best.
Do what u believe is right.
Change if u think you are on the wrong.
NEver too late for anything.

EVERY YEAR THERE IS ONE OR TWO THEMATIC BULL THEME AND MANY AS HIGH AS 50% SPECIFIC UNIQUE SPECIFIC STOCK RALLY OF ABOVE 50% MINIMUM GAIN loh..!!
IF WE CAN CATCH IT EARLY & RIDE THE BULL TO ITS PEAK WE WILL DO EXCEEDINGLY WELL WE WILL BE ABLE TO OUTPERFORM IN A FEW SHORT BULL RUNS AND PERHAPS RETIRE EARLY LIKE PETER LYNCH LOH!
OF COURSE LIKE WARREN BUFFET MAKING MONEY FROM STOCK MARKET AS A MOTIVE IS LONG OVER IT IS THE JOY, THE ADVENTURE & THE CONSTANT INTELLECTUAL CHALLENGE IN THE ART OF INVESTMENTS THAT CAUSED HIM TO SAY
""TAP DANCING TO WORK""
NOW MY HUMBLE OPINION FOR INDIVIDUAL STOCK PICK THIS
YEAR 2021 WILL BE INSAS ""THE COMING SUPER INDIVIDUAL STOCK BULL RUN""
WHY INSAS WILL GO INTO A BULL RUN FOR YEAR 2021?
ANSWER:
BECAUSE INSAS SHARE PRICES NOW REACHING SUPER EXPLOSIVE INFLEXION POINT WITH THE POTENTIAL EXPLOSIVE OUTBURST TO ITS ALL TIME HIGH DUE TO POTENTIAL AMPLIFY PROFITS TREND INSAS GOING TO ACHIEVED DUE TO ROBUST STOCK MARKET , INVESTMENT GAIN & THE STRONG SHOWING OF technology INARI LOH!
AND IF PROFITS KEEP INCREASING IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME OF INCREASE WILL INCREASE DIVIDENDS OR REWARD WITH BONUS ISSUES.
SO INSAS SHARES MUST GO UP HIGH AS THIS IS THE LAW!
TECHNOLOGY STOCKS, GLOVES STOCKS, FINANCE STOCKS ARE GETTING MORE VALUABLE IN WHICH INSAS HAVE EXPOSURE TO ALL OF THEM LIKE TECHNOLOGY THRU INARI & OMESTI, GLOVES THRU DGSB AND FINANCE THRU INSAS CREDIT & LEASING, M&A STOCKBROKING & ADVISORY AND SHARE INVESTMENT THRU INSAS HOLDING & SUBSIDIARIES ALL THESE EXPOSURES WILL REAPED IN SUPER PROFIT FOR 2021 MAH!
FOR YOUR INFORMATION INSAS ALREADY RECORD SUPER PROFIT FOR THE 1ST QTR 30 SEPT 2020 RECORD PROFITS OF RM 65M, EVEN THE WHOLE MSIA ECONOMY REGISTERED NEGATIVE GDP GROWTH LOH INSAS amazingly gain loh!!
LOOKING AT THE TREND OF INCREASING PROFIT FOR INSAS, ITS SHARE PRICE WILL EVENTUALLY SHOOT UP IN TANDEM LOH!
AGAIN WHEN ALL THE WORLD MARKETS ARE STARTING TO RECOVER FROM YR 2020 COVID19 SETBACK, U WILL SEE MAJOR RALLYS DUE TO RERATING OF STOCKS AND SUPER LOW INTEREST RATES enviroment THAT wii SPURS EQUITY PURCHASE MAH!
INSAS BEING SUPER UNDERVALUE WITH NAV OF RM 4.80 AND PE 8X WILL BE THE MAJOR PRIME BENEFICIARY here mah!
U r actually seeing emerging sign of INSAS share at 88 sen starting to run up like the early SUPERMAX & TOPGLOVES Gloves run in March to April Rally, the sign of coming bull which are very subtle with explosive upside b4 it explosively burst out with gains of few hundred % at the later stage mah...!!
U need to join the Insas stock early, as this is a safest fruit pickings when there are still abundance in supply now loh...!!

Some of 2020’s biggest technology winners - including Zoom Video Communications Inc, Shopify Inc and Nvidia Corp - have delighted shareholders with gains ranging from 100% to 400%. And they have a common thread: Besides being top performers, these companies are all market leaders that benefitted from trends that were supercharged by the pandemic. Whether it was the shift to remote work, the move to cloud-computing software, the rise of video-gaming or the surge in e-commerce sales, these companies were at the right place at the right time to profit.
With the year drawing to a close, the critical question is which of these trends will stick or falter over the next 12 months. The answer will also determine which technology names are best positioned to be victors in 2021. To figure it out, here’s a case-by-case review.
Cloud-computing software
The pandemic had a big impact on enterprise technology budgets. In recent years, companies have steadily shifted their information technology spending away from in-house equipment to the more flexible cloud-computing model, using external vendors such as Amazon.com Inc’s Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp’s Azure. This year’s shelter-in-place orders hastened the trend as companies raced to enable virtualised offices and remote-working environments for their employees. Zoom, too, was a big beneficiary as the company’s video-conferencing tool became the industry standard, because of its ease of use and quality of service.
Once the process of shifting to the cloud begins, there is no turning back. Executives get used to cloud software’s flexibility, savings and ability to generate faster business insights, resulting in a further push to accelerate the transition. And it’s nowhere near over. According to a recent survey conducted by Cowen Research, nearly half of corporate technology buyers said they were in the ""early stages” of their upgrading toward cloud computing, pointing to a growth runway that will be measured in years, not months. This bodes well for a company such as Okta Inc, the leading player in cloud-services user authentication and a stock-market darling this year. Demand for its software, which provides office workers the ability to sign on once to access dozens of different cloud applications, should remain robust for a long time.
Video-gaming
With much of the public spending more time inside with their families, gaming has thrived this year as one of the main options for in-home entertainment. Fortunately, the timing and product cadence of industry’s key releases this year couldn’t have been better. Take Nintendo Co’s virtual-life simulation game Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which was released in the spring and provided a much-needed outlet for escapism just as lockdowns were enforced across the United States. In the summer, Nvidia’s latest lineup of graphics cards were released, giving PC enthusiasts vastly improved performance for their games. Then in the fall, Sony Corp and Microsoft Corp launched their next-generation gaming consoles, marking the first hardware upgrades in seven years.
Going into 2021, the industry’s prospects remain bright. Gamers have developed new social connections online that should lead to greater engagement going forward. It’s also notable that many of the industry’s product cycles are just getting started. Specifically, Sony and Nvidia may be best positioned for success next year on the back of their latest offerings: Sony’s PlayStation 5 and Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 30 Series cards. Ever since these products were launched, the demand has been overwhelming. Whenever hardware becomes available for sale, they both instantly sell out in seconds. The product pipeline looks just as strong, with Sony slated to release an eagerly anticipated lineup of exclusive software titles and Nvidia set to launch new cards at lower price points.
E-commerce
Online sales have soared as consumers increasingly preferred shopping at home on their phones and computers over going to a physical store and risking infection. Even traditional retailers such as Target Corp and Best Buy Co were able to post stunning triple-digit sales growth for their online businesses, helped by popular offerings such as same-day delivery and curbside pickup.
Where things go from here is unclear. For certain categories such as clothing and jewelry, there are advantages for in-person shopping because buyers can touch and try on products. Also, some consumers may have reallocated a portion of what they normally would have spent for dining out or outdoor experiences toward online shopping. This could reverse next year as vaccines become widely available.
E-commerce growth may in fact have already peaked. According to the latest credit-card spending data, online sales have been materially slower over the last few weeks."

The controlling shareholder Dato' Sri Thong and PAC officially hold 32.96% just 0.04% short of the MGO threshold.
Dato' Sri Thong retired 2 year ago and now Insas is head by CEO Dato Wong and Executive Director Dato Dr. Tan.
The ongoing RI at RM 1.00 RPS (3.8 % dividend) with 3 free warrants is some assurance for Dato' Sri Thong to safeguard any hostile takeover.
The ESOS is a way the Board/Management telling Dato' Sri Thong that Board/Management is not part of Dato' Sri Thong PAC and it is about time now to unlock the value of Insas.
If Dato' Sri Thong wants to increase his Insas holding then he need to apply for MGO waiver.
1. Exercise of ESOS
2. Conversion of warrant
3. Share buyback."

Many nights we prayed
With no proof, anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now, we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could, whoa, yes
There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve?
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe
Oh-oh-oh
Mmm, yeah
In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer bird
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My hearts so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speakin' words
I never thought I'd say
There can be miracles
When you believe (When you believe)
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill (Mmm)
Who knows…

The villagers were very happy, after all there were hundreds of Monkeys in a nearby forest.
They caught the Monkeys and got them to the rich man. He bought hundreds of Monkeys and paid 100 for every Monkey the villagers gave him.
They began to make a living out of getting Monkeys from the forest and selling it to the rich man.
Soon, the forest began to run out of monkeys that were easy to catch.
Sensing this, the rich man offers 200 for every monkey. The villagers were ecstatic.
They went back to the forest, set up traps and caught the monkeys and got them to the rich man.
A few days later, the rich man announced he would pay 300 per monkey.
The villagers began climbing trees and risking their lives to catch monkeys and get them to the rich man – who bought them all.
There were no Monkeys left in the forest!
One day, the rich man announced he would like to buy more monkeys – this time for 800 each.
The villagers couldn’t believe this. They were desperately trying to get more monkeys.
Meanwhile, the rich man said he had to go back to the city on some business work and until he returns his manager would deal on his behalf.
Once he left, the villagers were unhappy. They were making quick and easy money from selling monkeys, but the forest no longer had monkeys.
This is when the manager of the rich man stepped in.
He made an offer the villagers could not refuse.
Pointing out to all the monkeys that the rich man had caged. He told the villagers he would sell the monkeys for 400 each.
“Sell them back to the rich man at 800 each when he comes back” the manager said.
The villagers were over the moon. Buy for 400 and sell for 800 in few days. They had just found the easiest way to double their money.
The villagers collected all their savings and even borrowed money.
There were long queues and within a few hours, almost all the monkeys were sold out.
Unfortunately, their happiness did not last long, as the manager went missing the next day and the rich man never came back.
Many villagers kept the monkeys with them, hoping the rich man would come back. But soon, they lost hope and had to let the monkeys back into the forest as feeding and taking care of the noisy monkeys became extremely difficult.
Good Luck!"

comeback in FY21, as we expect it to benefit from the deployment of 5G
wireless technology with more RF contents to be included in 5G devices. Inari
has recently increased its number of SiP lines to 22, from the initial 8 lines, in
order to cater for the strong volume loading. Its new JV with PCL
Technologies also serves as another prong of growth to the Group,
underpinned by the adoption of 400G Ethernet ports. With that being said, we
forecast a CAGR of 32.1% on Inari’s FY20-23F earnings. We initiate Inari with
an Outperform call, with a TP of RM3.80. We derive our TP based on a PE
multiple of 42x, which is c.15% premium to its local peers’ average. We deem
the premium multiple justifiable, given its multiple prong growth strategy that
will support the Group’s near to medium term outlook.
 Closest proxy to 5G. We believe Inari will greatly benefit from the
transition to the emerging 5G technology, given that the wireless
technology evolution will result in higher number of frequency bands
supported by 5G devices, which in turn, increases the need for more RF
filters to be fitted. Inari provides assembly and testing services to its long-
time customer, Broadcom for the latter’s premium FBAR filters. We
highlight that Inari has installed a total of 22 SiP lines currently, from 8
lines initially. Its RF segment is expected to flourish, considering the
overwhelming demand for the US-based smartphone maker’s latest 5G
model. We opine that the wireless component supply agreement signed
between Broadcom and the US phone smartphone maker also helps to
provide clarity to Inari in the short to medium term.
 New JV to start bearing fruit. Inari’s 30%-owned JV with the Taiwan-
based PCL Technologies will be focused on producing optical
transceivers with transfer speeds up to 400Gbps, which is 4x the speed
of current optical transceivers used in data centers. The growth of the
optical transceiver market will be underpinned by the adoption of 400G
Ethernet ports as well as data center growth. The new venture has made
its first shipment in June 2020 and we also expect to see positive
contribution from this JV to the Group in FY21.
 Valuation. We initiate coverage on Inari with an Outperform call,
ascribing a PE multiple of 42x on its CY21F EPS of 9.1sen per share.
The 42x multiple implies c.15% premium to local peers’ average. We
deem the premium justifiable, considering (i) its strong 3-year earnings
CAGR of 32.1%, (ii) closest proxy for 5G growth, and (iii) its exposure to
the growing optical transceiver space."

2021年1月27日 週三 下午1:04·2 分鐘 (閱讀時間)
【時報編譯柯婉琇綜合外電報導】日媒報導，蘋果公司正持續擴大中國境外的iPhone、iPad、Mac與其他產品生產，顯示儘管拜登上任後美中緊張關係或許有望緩解，但該科技巨頭仍馬不停蹄地加快其生產多元化的策略。
報導指出，消息人士透露蘋果最快將在今年中開始在越南生產iPad，這表示這家全球最大平板電腦製造商將首次在中國境外大量生產這個產品。
消息人士亦表示，蘋果也將擴大在印度的iPhone生產，並計畫最快本季開始在印度生產最新iPhone 12系列手機。印度是蘋果iPhone手機的第二大生產基地。
此外，蘋果亦將提高智慧揚聲器、耳機與電腦在東南亞的產能。
蘋果正在越南動員當地供應鏈，以擴大最新推出的HomePod mini產能。該產品自去年推出以來，一直都在越南生產。消息人士表示，蘋果也已經擴大AirPods等音訊產品在越南當地的生產。
另有消息來源透露，蘋果已將其一部分Mac mini桌機產能轉移到馬來西亞，今年也準備將部分MacBook生產轉移到越南。但蘋果大部分電腦的生產仍留在中國。
蘋果供應鏈的一名經理表示，蘋果和許多其他科技公司都希望擁有「中國以外的產能」，即使美國新總統上任，這個趨勢也不會放緩。這些科技公司也不僅是考慮周邊產品的產能分散，以蘋果為例，其目標是在新的據點為iPhone、iPad、MacBook、AirPods等許多核心產品建立產能，而這些新據點以東南亞國家為主。這在兩年前很難想像，但現在沒有什麼不可能變動。

半导体销售火红 科技5杰涨势惊艳
ADVERTISEMENT
（吉隆坡3日讯）全球半导体销售去年上涨6.5%，世界半导体贸易统计组织（WSTS）预测，今年的半导体市场将持续火红，再涨6.9%至4694亿美元，改写历史新高纪录。
在全球半导体销售大涨的加持下，科技股今天气势如虹，科技股指数上扬2.66点或3.23%，至85.04点。而10大上升股当中，科技股就占了半壁江山。
上升榜冠军--马太平洋（MPI，3867，主板科技股）威尽全场，大涨1.64令吉或4.78%，至35.94令吉，成交量为90万股。
另外4只挤入上升榜前10的科技股当中，UWC公司（UWC，5292，主板科技股）上涨64仙或5.17%，至13.02令吉；伟特科技（VITROX，0097，主板科技股）走高62仙或3.70%，至17.40令吉；阁代科技（GREATEC，0208，创业板）升高55仙或9.65%，至6.25令吉；以及科仪工业（KESM，9334，主板科技股）扬升36仙或2.19%，至16.78令吉。
值得一提的是，除了科仪工业以外，其馀4只科技股悉数创下历史闭市新高纪录。据半导体产业协会（SIA）刚公布的最新数据，去年12月全球半导体销售按年上涨8.3%，但按月微跌2%，至392亿美元（约1586亿令吉），写下逾2年以来最高单月销售额。

去年成长6.5% 今年上看6.9%
去年末季，全球半导体销售额为逾2年最高，按季和按年分别上涨3.5%及8.3%，至1175亿美元。至于全年销售成长6.5%，至4390亿美元，超出WSTS原本预测的增加5.1%，至4331亿美元。达证券分析员指出，这反映半导体领域能够抵御新冠肺炎疫情所引致的宏观经济不利因素。该组织也预期，今年全球半导体销售额将进一步增长6.9%，至创纪录的4694亿美元。
同时，该分析员表示，从各别区域来看，除了亚太区和日本分别按月增加0.8%及0.1%之外，去年12月底销售额按月下滑2%。按年比较，所有区域均有所成长，推高去年12月按年上涨8.3%；其中亚太区（所有其他地区）、日本和欧洲分别上涨12.7%、7.3%及4.7%。而美国和中国增幅放缓，各别成长11.1%及4.4%。
与此同时，12月全球半导体领域的出货量按月和按年分别上扬2.6%及7.6%，至26亿8080万美元。
按季比较，末季出货量微降0.4%，但按年稳步上涨18.6%，至79亿4060万美元。“全球半导体领域在去年的出货量按年攀升22.6%，至297亿8270万美元。上一次最高纪录是在2018年的278亿6630万美元。”
分析员称，在前端和后端业者持续投资、5G网络、以及受中国晶圆厂投资强劲推动国内供应链支撑下，出货量料在今年进一步走高。
个股方面，达证券维持该领域“增持”投资评级，并喊买益纳利美昌（INARI，0166，主板科技股）、友尼森（UNISEM，5005，主板科技股）和马太平洋，目标价分别为3.95令吉、9.42令吉及40.65令吉。"

05/02/2021 1:36 PM
Mabel TP is RM 3.90 plus a potential Bonus Split. The bullish sector outlook is in-line with the global outlook. INARI’s assembly and testing of radio frequency (RF) front-end filters for tier-1 smartphones (60% of revenue) ties directly into the thematic of growing smartphone 5G content. It will underpin a 20% revenue compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) till FY23.
Furthermore, with 5G penetration to increase in 2021/2022, Mabel sees limited downside risk to the crucial 1QFY22 (ended Sept) earnings. INARI’s valuations have historically been very buoyant prior to the 1QFY results (announced in late Nov). Lastly, INARI’s earnings outlook (2yr forward) is still 24% below the peak seen in 2018. Bull case future value (FV) of RM3.90 assumes earnings outlook (whether it is achieved is a different matter) rebounds to the 2018 high, and INARI retains the current multiple of 31x PER (2yr forward).
Catalyst: 4QFY21 results, Broadcom results, 5G News Flow, Apple EV New flows

Standardla retrace before next wave. The trend is there. No selling signal yet. INARi is FA counter, just ride as long the trend is there. Everythngs goes up will go down and vice versa.
As for INARI, still in uptrend. Now entering stage 2 correction. Everyone has their own trading plan, know ur entry and exit point. If u swing trader, maybe u can TP first, if u mid to long term, and enter low, still can relax.

Expect PAT to hit close to Rm100mil 1st time in history.
Share price should reflect naturally and dividend at least 2.5cent.
Gooshen is only looking at daily share price, we are looking are company profits, dividends and BI.

What gives comfort and holding power to the value investor is that he knows what he is waiting for and how long the wait might be.
There are more other potential catalysts—growth in earnings as business segments become increasing profitable, spin-offs, reorganizations, a new and good acquisition, big fair value gain on investment securities or simply a change in perception of investors, etc. Where there aren’t visible catalysts, activist investors sometimes get in and do the needful.
Note: The next catalyst time line:
The Board has taken note of the shareholders’ comments and will look into formulating a formal dividend policy depending how market recovers in the next nine (9) months. The Company has via an announcement on 26 November 2018 increased the interim dividend payment from 1 sen to 2 sen in respect of the financial year ending 30 June 2019.
Latest development of Plant 34 in Batu Kawan: Construction of Block A with a floor space of 240,000 sqft has been completed and we target to build in the facilities by Jan-March 2019. Production of a new product is expected to commence by second half of 2019.
Block A has been allocated to one of our current customers while Blocks B & C are targeted for new customers.

Numoni is a fintech startup. While it has not been able to gain traction in the e-payment industry, it continues to hold remittance licenses in Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as e-wallet license in Malaysia. Numoni is currently working on partnership or trade sale opportunities as the e-wallet businesses grow, at the same time continuing to develop its product platforms. We believe fintech continues to be important space for the Group to invest alongside its other Tech portfolio.

Think long term
“The big money is not in the buying and selling, but the waiting” - Charlie Munger
Finally, patience. If you’ve been you’ll know that we’re long-term investors at heart.
As humans we generally have a tendency for activity, we always want to be doing something. In financial markets, that can take the form of buying and selling frequently.
However, if we buy and sell, we unnecessarily interrupt the 8th wonder of the world from working its magic: compound interest.
To illustrate, if you start with $1 and it increases by 1% each day and is compounded daily for a year, it grows to $37. That’s a 37 fold increase.
After 5 years, that initial dollar becomes $77,002,912.
So long term investing is where the big money is made.

REMEMBER INSAS IS A CHEAPER EXPOSURE ALTERNATIVE TO INARI LOH!
Insas main jewel is its 16.4% stake or RM1.92bn tag in Inari, which already exceeded Insas marketcap of RM634m, implying its other divisions such as Financial service and credit & leasing division; Property investment and development division; Investment holding and trading division; Retail trading and car rental division businesses are “free”. Valuation is undemanding as the share price is trading at 0.33x P/B (vs 10Y average 0.4x) and 61% discount to revised SOP of RM2.36 (despite imputing a large 40% holding discount). We think such valuations have provided a sufficient “buffer” and will cushion further slide in share price, thanks to strong earnings visibility from financial serives (stockbroking and credit/leasing arm) and IT-related manufacturing businesses particularly from Inari (+30% EPS CAGR from FY20-23). Also, it has a solid balance sheet with NCPS of 89 sen (~97% to share price).

Malaysia Technology - Seeing new highs - Maintain POSITIVE on sector
POSITIVE rating on the sector as we remain upbeat on the global semiconductor supply chain’s upcycle. This should lead to strong earnings growth for selected Malaysian technology hardware companies in 2021-2022 and support the sector’s re-rating to richer valuations. Elsewhere, valuations are also supported by healthy balance sheets and strong domestic liquidity. However, the sector could face ‘overvaluation’ risks particularly if forward earnings growths start to taper or disappoint. Mabel Techs BUY picks this week are Inari, Greatec and DNEX..

Hence investors are worry liquidity will flow into bonds. This is just a knee-jerk reaction. Equities will still be the favored asset asset as it is easier to move around, unless those bonds give a much higher interest rate. The current yield is still not convincing enough to pull fund out from riskier assets."
