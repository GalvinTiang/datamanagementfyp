Malaysia National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme starts end-Feb 2021 and expected completion by end-2021 (looking at the speed of progress, likely earlier). Full vaccinations are not required to see the effects of Covid-19 cases and most importantly deaths coming down (see Israel). Hence, by 4Q21 (Oct-Dec) you should be able to see the full effects. Note markets are 6-12 months forward looking (see Gloves). Therefore, latest by 2Q21 (Apr-Jun) we should see share prices pop back to at least pre-pandemic levels
Note: this has not take into account re-rating catalysts:
a) Pent-up demand from revenge travel and gaming (Lifting of lockdowns - MY; UK)

Share with you a secret.
Inari Batu Kawan plant existing plant for the 200,000 sf space is 90% utilised for production. The Q2 yielded RM90mil PAT with this current capacity and utilisation.
The current factory still have unused space of 480,000 sf.
Assumption that price of product manufactured remains constant, you are looking at RM270mil PAT per quarter at full utilisation of the 680,000 sf batu kawan factory.
That's more than RM1bil PAT per annum.
Based on IBs report, the company is securing a few new customer to fulfil the space.
1. chip & assembly
2. EV power management module
3. Swiss client-sub module assembly
4. HK client-proprietary optical transceiver

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001951.jsp?ftp=829","Mar 17, 2021 8:00 AM","Mabel","Following Inari Amertron’s (INARI) strong quarter result recorded recently, Macquarie Equities Research (MQ Research) has a positive view on the group with its CY21 earnings outlook remains bullish. MQ Research maintains Outperform on INARI while raising the target price by 8.0% to RM3.80, which is 18.0% above from last Friday’s closing price of RM3.22.
High-certainty CY21E earnings outlook to prop up short-term valuations
INARI CY21 earnings outlook remains bullish, driven by 1) rebounding smartphone volumes from 2020’s COVID-depressed levels, 2) increased market share of a major smartphone end-customer, 3) rising 5G penetration, 4) modest radio frequency (RF)-content growth, and 5) supply chain inventory build. 1H FY21 delivered RF revenue growth of 66% year-on-year (YoY), and MQ Research forecasts +67% YoY RF revenue growth for FY21. Despite reported production trim, Apple is still guiding +11.6% YoY volumes. MQ Research expects elevated 3Q FY21 loadings due to a late 2020 product cycle. Management is also guiding for earlier ramp-up for the 2021 product cycle to avoid bottlenecks; MQ Research estimates loadings +25% YoY for 4Q FY21. As well, Opto segment revenue looks set for a +30% YoY rebound for 2H FY21. MQ Research believes CY21 earnings outlook remains high certainty and quality and sets a solid floor under INARI’s valuations. However, MQ Research also believes the volume-driven outlook is largely reflected in consensus expectations.
But R&D crystallisation to revenue would be a paradigm shift
INARI has been investing into research & development (R&D) for electromagnetic interference (EMI) sealing equipment, which is critical to reduce noise “cross-talk” in miniaturised 5G RF front end (FE) components. MQ Research estimates EMI sealing will add 7-10% to total back-end value-add. If successfully qualified by customers, MQ Research estimates INARI may be able to capture >80% share of the EMI sealing process (vs ~35% share for RF assembly). INARI has also been developing an alternative solution to copper pillar bumping that would allow it to undertake wafer bumping. Combined, MQ Research estimates fully scaled-up deployment of said technology could add roughly +10–20% incremental revenue to the RF segment long term and, more importantly, help to justify the high valuations seen by the stock of INARI, which is perceived as a higher-IP company. Management is guiding to RM20m/RM25m R&D spend for FY20/FY21. MQ Research’s bull-case fair value is RM4.70, factoring in 15% revenue upside and R&D add-back."

Still strong visibility from RF segment. While 1QCY typically is a softer quarter,
management noted that the loading came in unexpectedly strong. Meanwhile, the visibility
from its RF business remains decent with three months of fixed orders plus another three
months of floating orders. This signifies strong demand from its integrated device
manufacturer (IDM) customer on the back of overwhelming smartphone demand alongside
mitigation against any lockdown disruption. Beyond this, Inari is already working with its IDM
customer for the next flagship smartphone which will see additional 10-15% content boost.
Additionally, its IRIS scanner adoption business is picking up steam. Note that the revenue
contribution from this segment was at RM150m in FY18.
Optoelectronics - seeing light at the end of tunnel. The demand for its automobile and
industrial products has improved since 1QFY21 vs 2HFY20, after a washout FY20 which
was dragged by the weak automobile sales and lockdown restrictions which affected its
China and Philippines operations. Utilisation-wise, it is running at 65% vs 50% previously,
although the momentum is still partially hindered by the shortages of key components. Note
that such shortfall is expected to improve from Apr 21 onwards.
New business expansion underway at P55 and P34 plants. Inari (which still has a
remaining vacant space of 480,000 sf out of its new 680,000sft build-up in its P34 plant, and
50,000 sf at its new P55 plant) is benefitting from the ongoing trade tension. The group is
being approached by MNC customers with trade diversion-related orders. The group is
currently exploring business opportunities with three US and Chinese customers for
assembly services related to: a) optical transceiver modules, b chips and modules, and c)
power modules. We believe the net margins should be lucrative (at least 15%) judging from
the group’s track record of customer acquisitions. Management believes that this vacant
floor space could yield a RM700m revenue in a blue-sky scenario. On its floor space
allocation, the plan is to still have Block A reserved for its German customer and its acquirer
(with Inari now the approved vendor for the new entity following the M&A activities), Block B
for its US customer (for RF testers and PCL), while Block C is for customer C (with expertise
in RF tech) and new prospects."

Inari is only the few left's with good profit growth, and along with reasonable valuation by looking at forward PE. Look at the net profit margin it achieved last quarter, it's improved significantly and even exceeded most of the ATE margin. This counter also pay decent dividend to reward investor."

1. Firstly, the shares could have been sold on April 26th 2021 at about RM5.90 (closing price) or more.
2. Secondly, April 6th 2021 was the pay date for the 25.2 cent/share dividend meaning total net sales including dividend is RM6.152.
3. Thirdly, given the 'all in' purchase price of RM6.25 then the loss would only be 1.5% (over 3 months) which is hardly anything for share market investments.

>In a bourse ling, it said it is in contin- uous discussions with potential new cus- tomers within the semiconductor industry to provide OSAT services. And as part of the negotiation process, the group may be required to commit to substantial invest- ments in factory t-outs, and to acquire and install new manufacturing equipment and additional production space to secure new customers and or long-term supply orders.
As such, Inari Amertron said it is crit- ical that it secures the required funds, so that it may expeditiously carry out any ca- pacity expansion plans while putting it in a better position when negotiating with potential customers.
It added that it will be using the raised
funds to accelerate plans to acquire and invest in “good value, high quality and complementary semiconductor and OSAT related companies and assets” that can gen- erate sustainable revenue and earnings growth, good profit margins and good returns on invested capital.
Deduction: Can collect and invest. A well-managed company unlike many other public listed counter where the new share placement like PP is ridiculously at the low price,issuing ESOS or long term incentive plan without considering the shareholders' greater interests.One should note that IF the new placement like ESOS,PP or long term incentive plan were not fairly managed such actions will devalue the share prices!"

Analysts are positive on Inari Amertron Bhd’s RM1.07 billion private placement.
In a note, TA Securities Research analyst Wilson Loo pointed out that while the proposed private placement will be dilutive to earnings per share (EPS) on the onset, he is positive on the move as the proceeds raised will bode well and come in handy, especially for sizeable and accretive acquisitions and investments, while also alleviating potential stress on its balance sheet.
“More notably, by pursuing a private placement, Inari will also have the opportunity to rope in strategic investors to realise synergies,” he said.
Loo said if Inari is able to raise RM1.07 billion from the exercise, he estimates the company's cash position will more than double to RM1.82 billion, from RM755 million at the end of the first quarter of the calendar year 2021 (1Q21).
At the same time, a private placement of 10% of its total issued shares is expected to have an EPS dilution of 9.1%.
Loo has maintained his target price (TP) of RM4.33 and “buy” call on the stock.
Meanwhile, PublicInvest Research’s Chua Siu Li was also positive on the move, as the funds are necessary for the firm to expand and grow at a faster pace.
“The current global chips shortage will boost the need for more assembly and testing services; therefore, any investments and capacity expansions will be timely, allowing Inari to ride on and better benefit from the upcycle,” Chua said.
Based on an enlarged share base of 3.77 billion shares (which includes the placement shares and 91.5 million employee share options scheme [ESOS] options being fully exercised), the impact of EPS on the group will be around 11%. Chua maintained the research house's “outperform” call and RM4.40 TP.
RHB Research’s Lee Meng Horng pointed out that the group is setting on RM755 million in net cash as of the second quarter ended Dec 31, 2020 (2QFY21) and operations cash flow generation ability exceeding RM300 million a year, combined with the RM1.07 billion to be raised in the proposed placement, does allude to a potential imminent sizeable merger and acquisition (M&A) opportunity that is value accretive, especially after weighing its prudent capital expenditure (capex) investment cycle over the past few years.
“Besides, raising its war chest in such a prevailing upcycle market valuation could be optimal from its capital structure point of view,” Lee noted.
The RHB analyst said that on a pro forma basis, the EPS dilution would be at 9.1% on the assumption that the maximum scenario under the placement is achieved. Net assets per share could rise to 65 sen, while net cash share may increase to 54 sen, from 23 sen currently.
When contacted, one anonymous analyst viewed that deploying a private placement is a faster way of raising funds versus a cash call such as a rights issue.
“In this current environment, it is now a great time to raise money via a share placement. However, it may not be such a good time to conduct M&A activities because of the high valuations involved in the sector,” the analyst noted.
As such, given Inari’s conservative M&A track record, the analyst expects a sensible investment to be made by Inari and that it should be within the outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) space. Still, the analyst said this is contingent on Inari securing a good deal for any potential M&A targets.
The analyst was cautious over the placement in general. While a private placement means more expeditious fundraising, shareholders would have to put faith in Inari that it will eventually make a purchase that delivers value, in contrast to the group announcing from the get-go that it would be acquiring a specific company.
The company announced yesterday to Bursa Malaysia that it wants to raise up to RM1.07 billion via a private share placement to be used for capex, acquisitions and investments.
Under its proposed placement, Inari will issue up to 333 million new shares — which accounts for 10% of its share capital — to third party investors at an indicative price of RM3.20 a share.
The placement is expected to be completed in the second half of 2021, the group said, adding that its share capital will rise to 3.77 billion shares after the placement and the full exercise of the group's ESOS.
The private placement is the largest among local semiconductor-related firms which seek to take advantage of the current share price rally.
At noon market close, shares in Inari were 2.76% or nine sen lower at RM3.17, valuing it at RM10.59 billion. It saw 7.32 million shares done."

If that's a week company calling for pp, then you should be wary. After the pp, the money would have gone into purchase of something which might not exist at all, only a fake invoice, or buy something extremely expensive from a seller.

As a student, I would appreciate if you could share some technical analysis/explanation, or you could just completely ignore me too. When looking at fundamentals, on paper we project future CF for eg. over long term. Having rapid sell down in short period for stock like this with good future prospect is a good case study for us.
I've seen the comments above, looking not for target price but the sound technical points that people might make which we have not looked into. You put ample attention to this stock and focus a lot on short term fluctuations. No offence, being hate-motivated, seems like this stock has adversely affected you a lot or could be just your personality.
Good luck to you!"

When a stock is cheap, look for the reason,why a stock is cheap?.
If a stock is cheap for a temporary reason, then it becomes value investing.
If a stock is cheap for a permanent reason, then it becomes a value trap.
When you look at the situation if INSAS, you come to the question:
When can I reasonably expect the temporary undervaluation of INSAS to be resolved to it's proper price?
If your answer is I don't know when it will resolve, how it who will resolve it, or why would they?
Then you are better off not owning INSAS.
Just look at the amazing growth track record of value creation of insas for the past 10 yrs

PP is one of the good way to capitalize the share price, and the fastest way to raise cash.
Let's think: Only dilute 10% but you get almost RM 1bil of fund.
That's almost RM 0.30 cash per share. With Inari's ROE of >20%, I'm confident the management will make good use of this fund to further expand the company.

Inari plan 10% PP for RM 1.07 billion
Insas hold Total (units) 545,503,575 Inari. Mind do the math how much its worth?
Thus U should Think Of Start Buying Insas Mah !
Alot people thought Thong sell Inari is bad for Insas loh!
Tapi it is not true mah...if Thong Sold Inari & bought insas is much a better deal & much better hedge...since owning Insas is equivalent to owning Inari at a much lower cost & with the same or even better exposure mah!
Lu tau boh ?
Insas has the best value in klse loh!
Lets be practical lah....today inari is rm 3.26 loh!
What is Inari value to insas loh?
Rm 3,260 x 0.82 = Rm 2,670.
Inari alone is already worth Rm 2,670 to insas, what about insas other assets & business like invest banking, stock broking, Credit & leasing, properties development & investment, thus Insas may worth at least Rm 5.00 loh...!!
The Incredible point is that u can still buy Insas very cheap at Rm 0.80 per share mah!"

here's what actually happening now on some factories .
The management can play around with workers' shift to fit the 60 % capacity requirement .Depending on how the factory usual night shift capacity, ''some'' factories (not all k) night shift won't be 100% capacity as compared to day shift
.so for example their usual night shift capacity is 40-50%, so for calculation ,lets take 50% as example
Day shift capacity reduced to 60% , hence 40% lost
Night shift compensate by increasing 10% from 50% to 60% capacity
Hence overall 30% hit on capacity with 70% running ad per usual ...it's painful but then its just short term la, undeniable stocks market is emotional but then stocks market is 6 months 9 months ahead of present ma

INSAS HATHAWAY IS AN OPPORTUNITY BUY NOT TO BE MISSED MAH!
PA is just another goreng stock loh...!
PA Rm 0.495 V Insas Rm 0.805
Surely Insas will beat PA flat over the medium term says within a year, just mark my words loh!
Peter Lynch had this very important advice loh....!!
When a stock is cheap, look for the reason,why a stock is cheap?.
If a stock is cheap for a temporary reason, then it becomes value investing.
If a stock is cheap for a permanent reason, then it becomes a value trap.
When you look at the situation if INSAS, you come to the question:
When can I reasonably expect the temporary undervaluation of INSAS to be resolved to it's proper price?
If your answer is I don't know when it will resolve, how it who will resolve it, or why would they?
Then you are better off not owning INSAS.
Why Raider says Insas can beat PA flat within 1 year leh ?
Bcos Insas has shown very consistent earnings support & value mah!
Insas is not a goreng stock like PA mah....thus medium term Insas will surely do better n gain better appreciation than PA mah!
Just look at the amazing growth track record of value creation of insas for the past 10 yrs

Furthermore, CEO Kean Lau is the owner of 1.2% of the company's shares.
On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 9 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones."

The smartphone market continues to enjoy tailwinds, lifted by the overall demand surge in end-point devices among consumers amid the prolonged work-from-home trend. As the chip shortage continues to send MNCs scrambling for floor space, Inari is constantly receiving enquiries as the group still has 480k sq. ft. of unutilised space in its P34 plant to welcome potential customers. Inari is currently in discussion with three potential MNC customers where two of them are exhibiting high probability of success.

2021年07月10日
下半年投资策略
（吉隆坡9日讯）尽管当前乌云密布，但随着本地疫苗接种加速，分析员认为，马股市场应会在下半年恢复元气，并点名股息、科技、商品和复苏主题的投资策略。
大华继显研究分析员在今日发布报告指出，群体免疫的乐观情绪，相信能消除政局不稳的忧虑；昨日富时隆综指挫跌1.4%，因为巫统宣布撤销对国盟的支持，引发投资者担忧。
“不过，我们认为市场在很大程度上，已消化了政治风险。更重要的是，未来潜在新政府采取的政策方向，也不太可能与国盟当前方针有太大偏差。”
因此，随着我国疫苗接种加速，焦点会重新转向经济重开的主题，分析员估计市场将从第三季中期开始复苏。
虽然马股市场复苏不均衡，但预计末季仍会持续复苏，归功于广泛市场赢家所引领。
“在末季达到群体免疫的目标，将令我国在明年可重开边境。”
同时，分析员列出年底综指1635点目标，等同本益比16.2倍，符合历史均值。
分析员还列出了下半年重要正面事件，包括本地封锁松绑，希望可在第三季底开放跨州、云顶（GENTING，3182，主板消费股）户外主题公园开张、特定种植股和商品股迎来异常强劲盈利季度，及年底实现群体免疫。
不过，关键风险则是下月单日卖空禁令将解除，及手套均价进一步潜在走低。
大华继显研究选股
综指明年底料冲1775点
放眼明年，当我国经济重开，并顺利展开复苏的前提下，分析员估计综指有显著上行空间。
“假设盈利增长1到2%，且估值恢复到疫前的16.9倍水平，综指明年底有望触及1775点。”
投资主题选股
近期催化剂不清晰
配合上述展望，分析员列出了4大投资主题，包括价值和高股息投资、科技股（受惠于需求增长、贸易转移及全球5G科技推出）、经济重开，及特定商品超级周期主题。
因此，分析员建议增持有价值的银行股、高股息的产托股、复苏主题的博彩股等、电子与制造业的特定出口股，及商品为主的特定提炼和种植股。
报告补充，分析员大型股首选为联昌国际（CIMB，1023，主板金融股）、云顶大马（GENM，4715，主板消费股）、益纳利美昌（INARI，0166 ，主板科技股）和MyEG（MYEG，0138，主板科技股）。
同时，还有齐力（PMETAL，8869，主板工业股）、双威（SUNWAY，5211，主板工业股）、马电讯（TM，4863，主板电信与媒体股）和云升控股（YINSON，7293，主板能源股）。
中型股首选合成种植（HSPLANT，5138，主板种植股）和腾达科技（PENTA，7160，主板科技股）；环境、社会与监管（ESG）股项首选为亚通、联昌国际、益纳利美昌、MyEG、双威和云升控股。
“不过，在近期市场催化剂不清晰之际，即冠病确诊病例高居不下，投资者最初只会青睐价值/股息和科技增长股。”
手套建筑料跑输大市
至于手套和建筑股，分析员相信下半年仍会跑输大市；这两大股项在今年上半年已显著跑输综指。
“在需求放缓和全球供应强劲增长情况下，手套商应该仍会因均价下跌而表现逊色。”
建筑股方面，虽然受益于房产销售显著恢复，但大型项目加速推进的希望渺茫，将令本就承受打击的建筑股表现不佳。"

Since you say BCorp's share price will be rm5 to rm10 in future, why VT so silly to sell millions of ICULS which he subscribed at RM1 each in 2012, at 26 to 28.5 sens over these few month's even foregoing the 5% interest due in April 2022?
If VT is confident the mothershare price will be RM1 by April 2022, he should wait until maturity to sell at RM1 plus 5% interest when automatically converted to mothershare? Nobody will lose more than 70% of his principal even to loyal supporters or macai since VT is a well known miser?

1. Whenever you invest in any company, you’re looking for its market cap to rise. This can’t happen unless buyers are paying higher prices for the shares, making your investment more valuable.-Peter Lynch
COMMENT: In other words, if there isn't strong demand for such shares, share price can't go up. Refer to 2021's GENETEC and 2020 TOPGLOV's strong demand. By technical analysis, you buy bullish uptrending shares. By fundamental analysis, you buy undervalued shares undiscovered by the market. Note: Whether company makes profit or not, is secondary.
INSAS MKTCAP IS RM 609M BASING ON ITS SHARE PRICE 88 SEN...BUT ITS SHAREHOLDERS FUNDS IS RM 2.05 BILLION OR NTA RM 2.96 PER SHARE LOH!
2. Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism and die on euphoria.-John Templeton
COMMENT: Basically this is the cycle of markets and stocks. Stage 1, nobody wants the stock because the stock is mostly negative conditions. Stage 2, minority see's the potential and buys some of the share. Stage 3, news of profitability and growth is starting to show. More people buy. Stage 4, everyone knows the promising growth story and bullish target prices, rushing to buy the stock no matter how high it goes. (Sounds like 2020-2021 of KLSE healthcare sector ). Right now, I'd argue that we are in overall KLCI stage of skepticism, with political uncertainty and Covid-19 pandemic.
CORRECTLOH....THIS IS THE BEST TIME TO PICK UP INSAS BCOS ITS PE IS LESS THAN 4X MAH!
3. To distill the secret of sound investment into three words, we venture the motto - Margin of Safety.-Benjamin Graham
COMMENT: Margin of Safety = Intrinsic Value - Current Stock Price. In other words, what is the potential gain? It never said share price must go up immediately if you buy with margin of safety, but just shows that the true value is much higher. See how SAM was pretty much sleeping until recently. ON MARGIN OF SAFETY INSAS PRICE IS 88 SEN BUT ITS NTA IS RM 2.96, ITS PE LESS THAN 4X AND INSAS HAS NET CASH OF RM 500M OR RM 72 SEN PER SHARE AND INSAS PAYS A MINIMUM DIVIDEND OF 2 SEN, GIVING A DIVIDEND YIELD OF 2.3% PA.
4. In a world driven by disruption, make sure you’re on the right side of change.-Cathie Wood
COMMENT: Tech has disrupted industries from newspapers to brick-and-mortar businesses to cigarettes. Were STAR, PARKSON, BAT on the right side of change? Invest in innovative companies.THE KEY CONTRIBUTORS TO INSAS SUCCESS COMPRISES OF SUPER GROWTH STOCK INARI THEIR ASSOCIATES AND HIGH CONSISTENT EARNER, ITS FINANCE & ADVISORY DIVISION, BOTH ARE WELL RECEIVE IN THIS CURRENT DISRUPTION ECONOMY LOH!
5. The need for patience if big profits are to be made from investment.-Philip Fisher
COMMENT: Most of us sell stocks when we profit 5%, 10% and so on. Why not wait longer, and aim for bigger returns and above instead? Stocks like SKPRES and SCIENTX were among the 10 baggers in the past 10 years. CORRECTLOH...INSAS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE U SHOULD HAVE LONGER INVESTMENT HORIZON OF MORE THAN 3 YEARS LOH!
GETTING 2 TO 3 BAGGERS HERE IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE MAH!
6. 没成长，不要买。有成长，可以买 -冷眼冯时能(No growth, Dont Buy. Got growth, Can Buy. -Cold Eye Fong Siling)
COMMENT: Our homegrown legendary investor that shares his insights via his books and Nanyang newspaper column. Emphasises growth investing for better than mediocre returns. His 2020 Nanyang articles on stocks after the 2020 crash should have benefited readers.
I hope the 6 quotes picked from a diverse range of investors of different eras would serve readers well. IF U EMPHASIS ON GROWTH....U CAN FOCUS ON INSAS LOH....IT WILL BE REPORTING STRONGEST EPS GROWTH IN EPS FOR 2021 AND ITS ASSOCIATES INARI WILL HAVE BIGGEST FUTURE GROWTH POTENTIAL DUE TO 5G MAH!"

Daily technical highlights – (INSAS, YTLPOWR)
Author: kiasutrader | Publish date: Tue, 3 Aug 2021, 9:17
Insas Bhd (Trading Buy)
• As an indirect technology play – via its 14.4% stake in semiconductor service provider Inari Amertron (whose share price hasrisen 26.8% YTD) – INSAS shares (down 6.4% YTD) could play catch up ahead.
• Noticeably too, INSAS’ share of Inari Amertron’s existing market cap (14.4% of RM12.88b) stands at RM1.85b presently,which is slightly more than tripled its own current market valuation of RM583.5m.
• The group also has exposure to the stock market activity (via its wholly-owned stockbroking company M&A Securities) withother businesses in investment holding & trading, retail trading & car rental and property investment & development.
• For the 9-month period ended March 2021, INSAS reported net profit of RM217.3m (from net loss of RM2.4m previously),lifted by a combination of robust operating earnings and exceptional gains from financial assets.
• Valuation-wise, the stock is currently trading at a PBV multiple of 0.30x (based on its book value per share of RM2.96 as ofend-March 2021), which is near its 3-year historical mean.
• On the chart, the stock could attempt to exit an ongoing consolidation pattern following the DMI Plus crossover of the DMIMinus signal and the rising momentum indicator above the zero line.
• Riding on the renewed strength, INSAS’ share price will probably climb to test our immediate resistance target of RM1.00 (R1;14% upside potential). A break above R1 may then lift the stock towards our next resistance threshold of RM1.07 (R2; 22%upside potential).
• We have pegged our stop loss price at RM0.77 (or 12% downside risk)."

Private placement seems to be welcomed by institutional investors and large corporations alike, coupled with ongoing talks with a few large MNCs (Which is what the PP is for, capex investment to accommodate the needs and requirements of the new prospective customers)"

● The group attributed the lower qoq sales from RF division in 4QFY6/21 mainly to lower
workforce availabilities, which were capped at 60% during the full movement control
order (FMCO) implementation in Jun 21. However we expect a stronger qoq RF
division performance in 1QFY6/22F, in view of higher workforce availabilities, given
that Penang has moved into Phase 2 of the national recovery plan on 7 Jul 2021,
which allows the group to operate with a higher 80% workforce capacity. In addition,
management highlighted that over 90% of its workforce in Malaysia has completed two
doses of Covid-19 vaccine as at early-Aug 2021.
● We expect a higher contribution from value-added processes, such as electromagnetic
(EMI) shield coating for the RF division, in FY22F, following positive feedback from
Inari’s customer. The group expects a higher percentage of RF chips to undergo EMI
shield coating process in FY22F. Inari is allocating RM100m capex in FY22F, mainly
for three new system-in-package lines, eight EMI shield systems and wafer processing
equipment.
● The group is upbeat about the new integrated system for its module division at P55, a
new 50k sq ft 5-storey building extension, located next to P13 in Bayan Lepas. The
group is preparing for the pilot line to qualify for assembly and testing of automotive
power module for a new US customer. We estimate this could be a new growth engine
for Inari — contributing 15% of the group’s revenue within the next three years."

Glaring us right in the face is Insas Bhd, which owns 16.33% or 545.5mil shares in Inari.
At its price of 93.5 sen as of Aug 11, Insas has a market capitalisation of RM648.28mil.
Insas is controlled by Datuk Seri Thong Kok Khee,
Thong, who also serves as the non-executive director of Inari, owns a direct stake of 0.07% or 2.15 million shares in the company.
Insas has started moving since Inari’s uptrend began two weeks ago. From 88 sen on Aug 3, the stock now stands at 93.5 sen.
Nonetheless on its own, Insas is a decent company with strong financial backing.
Based on its latest cash position of RM573.58mil, the stock has cash per share of 82.7 sen. It is also only trading at a price earnings ratio of 2.66 times.
The stock currently offers a dividend yield of 2.13% based on the 2 sen dividend it gave.
For the nine months to June 30, 2021, Insas has so far recorded net profit of RM217.26mil from a previous loss of RM2.42mil last year. The good results were due to the buoyant capital markets last year, and disposal of shares.
For the third quarter to June 30, Insas’ net profit of RM69.72mil from a previous loss of RM51.48mil was also helped by the higher equity contribution from Inari of RM12.6mil."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001951.jsp?ftp=851","Aug 12, 2021 2:43 PM","Mr.Sm Invest123","Insas -The Opportunity
Currently, Inari contributes roughly 8 sen operating profit to Insas every year.
Based on Inari’s growth guidance by Inari’s management, this 8 sen contribution should then be expected to double to 16 sen over the next two years.
Meanwhile, Insas’ other businesses in the financial sector, namely corporate advisory, stock broking, financial lending and investments are expected to generate another 9 sen to 15 sen per annum to Insas.
For the nine month period, Insas already generated earnings per share (EPS) of 32 sen.
Based on this EPS of 32 sen:
PE 6X = RM1.920
PE 8X = RM2.560
Now even without taking into account the contribution from Inari, Insas’ own assets amount to RM2.36 per share.
If we were to assume that the fair value of Insas is its net tangible asset plus its 16% holding in Inari, thus Insas’ revised net asset value (RNAV) with Inari will be as follows
1. When Inari RM3.60, Insas is RM5.19
2. When Inari is RM4.00, Insas is RM5.50
3.When Inari is RM4.40, Insas is RM5.88.
For now, Insas is only 93.5 sen.
For those who want an even cheaper entry to Insas, they may consider Insas warrant C which came to life on March 5, 2021.
With a five year lifespan, the warrant has an exercise price of 90 sen. The warrant is currently trading at 40 sen.
Insas’ business
Insas is most known for being the owner of M&A Securities Sdn Bhd, a stock broking company providing trading services for securities listed on Bursa Malaysia.
However, it has other principle business segments which consist of:
stock broking, provision of corporate finance & advisory services and structured finance
investment holding & trading;
technology & IT related services;
retail trading and car rental;
property investment & development.
The group’s main operations are located in Malaysia and Singapore and its principal associate company’s operations are located in Malaysia, Philippines and China."

Author: HLInvest | Publish date: Thu, 24 Oct 2019, 9:36 AM
Technology and IT-related division is the anchor earnings contributor. INSAS core activity is investment in high growth technology companies in three broad technology sectors namely electronics manufacturing services (EMS), financial transaction processing (“Fintech’) and bio-technology. The major investee companies in the respective tech sectors are INARI, Numoni Pte. Ltd. (“Numoni’) and Sengenics Corporation Pte. Ltd (“Sengenics”).
INARI is involved in the Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (“OSAT”) industry for radio frequency (RF) products and tailored EMS contract manufacturing to the semiconductor optoelectronic industry. According to earnings consensus, INARI is expected to report earnings CAGR of 23% for FY19-21 on the back of a 20% hike on revenue, driven by an expected surged in related RF components demand to support the growing need for frequency bands and smartphone sales volume in next 5G generation smartphones sales. Apart from RF, the group expects improving sales from the optoelectronics division, driven by resilient demand for fibre optics transceivers and higher sales volume for sensors.
Numoni was originally formed to bring financial inclusion to the under-banked with its Cash-in Cash-out solutions, coinciding with rapid changes in the financial payment industry with the onset of mobile enabled financial technology (“Fintech”) during the last few years. Numoni’s subsidiary in Malaysia, Numoni DFS Sdn Bhd is licensed by Bank Negara Malaysia to conduct e-wallet and remittance businesses.
Sengenics is a functional proteomics company that was originally spun out from research that was originally carried out at Cambridge University in the UK. The company has a patented technology called KREX and has made good progress engaging world renowned customers and collaborators that include top pharma, biotech companies and ivy league-class academic institutions in the USA, Europe and Asia as it expands its footprint in the biomarker industry.
Riding on INARI’s success (contributed average 50% to INSAS FY18-19 earnings). INSAS main asset is its 19% stake or RM1.23bn in INARI, which already exceeded INSAS market cap of RM586m, implying that the market is valuing its other divisions such as Financial service and credit & leasing division; Property investment and development division; Investment holding and trading division; Retail trading and car rental division businesses for free. Meanwhile, INSAS is also holding a 12% stake in HOHUP (RM23m market cap), 10% stake in OMESTI (RM20m market cap), 25% in DGSB (RM18m market cap) and 8% in SYF (RM10m market cap).
INSAS is a cheaper entry into INARI as it is the parent company, holding an effective stake of 19%. Despite being an associate company, INARI contributed approximately 50% of INSAS FY18-19 PBT while the rest are coming from its financial services and credit & leasing, property investment and development, retail trading and car rental as well as investment holding and trading segments. Based on INARI’s current price level, INSAS RNAV is worth at least RM4.12, trading at a steep 79% discount (refer to Figure 5). Even after applying a 30% discount for its liquidity, there is still a 241% upside to INSAS revised value of RM2.88.
Bullish signs ahead after staging triangle breakouts on the daily and weekly charts. After building base above the support trendline from a low of RM0.695 (23 May), INSAS finally staged a long awaited triangle breakouts on its daily and weekly charts this week. The two triangle breakouts could potentially kick start a new upswing soon, supported by positive technical indicators and trending above the multiple key SMAs. Taking out the immediate resistance at RM0.87 (24 July high) would spur prices higher towards RM0.90 (52-week high) next before reaching our LT objective at RM1.00 psychological barrier. Supports are pegged at RM0.815 (200W SMA) and RM0.80 (20W SMA). Cut loss at RM0.78."

While Michael Burry and Cathie Wood keep arguing, investors are starting to size up their portfolios as the record highs keep going. Fed taper concerns and the spread of the Delta variant don't seem to be able to weigh on sentiment for more than a day, though trading is getting choppier and warnings of a correction are getting louder. Overnight, Dow and S&P futures slipped 0.5%, while contracts linked to the Nasdaq fell back 0.4%.
Things are especially getting eerie without an S&P 500 pullback of at least 5% since last October, though Q2 corporate earnings have been strong and many investors are betting on a continuing economic recovery. While the ""buy the dip"" crowd may also be becoming a possible force to be reckoned with on Wall Street, some are still flagging caution and say there are ""clouds on the horizon.""
Research from Citi: ""Our panic/euphoria model remains very elevated and is warning of coming losses. This is the longest period of ebullient readings without a market correction since 1999/2000 and we anticipate that something will give. The Street is too complacent.""
Another alert: ""Against a backdrop of thin liquidity as investors take summer vacations, minor stock market corrections are to be expected in a market that is pricing in peak earnings, extended price-to-earnings ratios and elevated economic growth expectations,"" added Richard Saperstein, chief investment officer at Treasury Partners."

Valuation and recommendation
Raise FY22-23 EPS by 8-9%. We raise our FY22-23 earnings forecasts by 8-9% after adjusting for higher sales growth assumption and lower effective tax rate.
Maintain BUY with higher RM4.30 TP. Inari has completed its 10% private placement and raised about RM1.0bn, which we think could be a prelude to something bigger – i.e. securing new major customers or executing value-creating M&A.
Coupled with secured earnings visibility driven by its RF segment, we expect Inari’s valuation re-rating to continue, which is also helped by positive equity fund flows into the tech sector. We maintain our BUY call on Inari with a higher revised TP of RM4.30, based on 35x CY22 PE.
Key risks include: 1) Weaker-than-expected 5G smartphone sales, especially of the US end-customer; 2) Sharp depreciation of USD against MYR; and 3) Global economic slowdown."

派对还没结束 券商续喊买科技股
2021年09月11日
（吉隆坡11日讯）科技股的高估值，已经引起部分投资者却步，不过，大华继显研究继续看好这个增长迅速的领域，高呼“派对还没结束”！
大华继显研究在最新报告指出，在5G时代降临的环境之下，全球半导体销售保持着高速增长，这也带动了半导体设备需求的高速增长，让我国相关领域业者将持续受惠。
世界半导体贸易数据已将今年全球半导体销售额增长预测，从原本的19.7%，上修至25.1%；全球半导体设备销售同样预测增长34.10%。
强劲的增长势头，也让本地的科技业者受惠，分析员预计，本地半导体封测（OSAT）业者今年的销售增长料达19%，明年再涨12%；设备制造商今年的销售增长更可达60%，明年再涨32%。
“由于贸易转移和更便宜的成本基础，这些数据都将高于全球基准。”
大补货时代未结束
高增长已是预期之内，但高估值却引发了担忧；目前，本地半导体封测企业的预期本益比估值，已较5年均值高出2个标准差。
不过分析员仍强调，“尽管风险回报不那么吸引人，估值部分已经反映了强劲的盈利预期，但历史趋势表明，增长仍有空间延伸到2022年。”
在过去半导体设备出现需求和供给两侧强烈冲击，导致的大补货时代降临时，最短的连续按年增长达到了20个月（2009年11月至2011年6月）；而最长的大补货时代持续了29个月（2016年8月至2018年12月）。
而目前的连续按年增长仅为17个月。
在这样的背景下，大部分制造商都已施加了可延迟但不可取消订单的合约条款，以更好地管理库存过剩的风险。
“所以估值已经反映了强劲的盈利预期，但派对仍未结束。”
大华继显研究分析员因此继续呼吁“增持”科技股。
半导体设备制造商净利与赚幅
首选益纳利美昌、阁代科技
尽管看好整体科技领域的前景，但考虑到估值已经偏高，分析员强调需要挑选拥有独特价值和高增长的股项；其中，益纳利美昌（INARI，0166 ，主板科技股）和阁代科技（GREATEC，0208，主板科技板）就成为了首选。
而腾达科技（PENTA，7160，主板科技股）也因股价表现仍落后，而受到青睐。
分析员也总结了科技股今年次季的业绩表现，其中益纳利美昌、阁代科技，以及伟特机构（VITROX，0097，主板科技股），都交出了让人惊喜的业绩表现。
另一方面，电子制造服务（EMS）企业，因为次季的管控趋严而受到了短期的利空，但随着政府逐渐放宽管控，分析员也预计这些企业产能将迅速复苏。
“对于电子制造服务领域，我们钟爱威铖（VS，6963 ，主板工业股），因其投资方向比同行更好。我们预计该公司3年可取得28%的复合增长净利。”"

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001951.jsp?ftp=856","Sep 27, 2021 10:03 AM","kong73","Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., May 15, 2020 – TSMC (TWSE: 2330, NYSE: TSM) today announced its intention to build and operate an advanced semiconductor fab in the United States with the mutual understanding and commitment to support from the U.S. federal government and the State of Arizona.
This facility, which will be built in Arizona, will utilize TSMC’s 5-nanometer technology for semiconductor wafer fabrication, have a 20,000 semiconductor wafer per month capacity, create over 1,600 high-tech professional jobs directly, and thousands of indirect jobs in the semiconductor ecosystem. Construction is planned to start in 2021 with production targeted to begin in 2024. TSMC’s total spending on this project, including capital expenditure, will be approximately US$12 billion from 2021 to 2029. This U.S. facility not only enables us to better support our customers and partners, it also gives us more opportunities to attract global talents. This project is of critical, strategic importance to a vibrant and competitive U.S. semiconductor ecosystem that enables leading U.S. companies to fabricate their cutting-edge semiconductor products within the United States and benefit from the proximity of a world-class semiconductor foundry and ecosystem.
TSMC welcomes continued strong partnership with the U.S. administration and the State of Arizona on this project. This project will require significant capital and technology investments from TSMC. The strong investment climate in the United States, and its talented workforce make this and future investments in the U.S. attractive to TSMC. U.S. adoption of forward-looking investment policies to enable a globally competitive environment for a leading edge semiconductor technology operation in the U.S. will be crucial to the success of this project. It will also give us the confidence this and other future investments by TSMC and its supply chain companies will be successful.
In the United States, TSMC currently operates a fab in Camas, Washington and design centers in both Austin, Texas and San Jose, California. The Arizona facility would be TSMC’s second manufacturing site in the United States."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001951.jsp?ftp=856","Sep 27, 2021 10:09 AM","kong73","Samsung Foundry, the world's second largest contract maker of chips, is another foundry to build a leading-edge fab in the USA The company's Project Silicon Silver manufacturing facility in Texas will cost over $17 billion and is projected to be larger when compared to TSMC's fab in Arizona. It remains to be seen which process technology SF plans to use at the fab, but one of the options is its 3 nm MBCFET-based leading-edge node. Meanwhile, it is unclear whether Samsung is seeking to build chips for the USA government agencies.
While the USA government would prefer to help local chipmakers, such as Intel or GlobalFoundries, its initiatives to assist production of chips in the country have so far gathered significant interest from Taiwan-based TSMC and South Korea-based Samsung. In any case, it looks like the plan to bring leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing back to the USA works and a $27 million planned investment is a good proof of that, depending on tax abatements throughout the process."

The Best Investment Is Here mah!
WHY INSAS IS A GREAT INVESTMENT LEH ?
INSAS AN OPPORTUNITY BUY NOT TO BE MISSED MAH!
Peter Lynch had this very important advice loh....!!
When a stock is cheap, look for the reason ,why a stock is cheap?.
If a stock is cheap for a temporary reason, then it becomes value investing.
If a stock is cheap for a permanent reason, then it becomes a value trap.
When you look at the situation of INSAS, you come to the question:
When can I reasonably expect the temporary undervaluation of INSAS to be resolved to it's proper price?
If your answer is I don't know when it will resolve, how it & who will resolve it, or why would they?
Then you are better off not owning INSAS.
Why Raider says Insas can be a strong growth stock ?
Bcos Insas has shown very consistent earnings growth support & value creation every year for the past years mah!
Insas is not a goreng stock, thus its share show steady appreciation consistently...thus over medium term, Insas will surely do better n gain better appreciation than most goreng stocks loh!
Just look at the amazing growth track record of value creation of insas for the past 10 yrs
June 2021- Nta Rm 2.99
Mar 2021 - Nta Rm 2.96
Dec 2020 - Nta Rm 2.83
Dec 2019- Nta Rm 2.68
Dec 2018- Nta Rm 2.54
Dec 2017..Nta rm 2.49
Dec 2016 ...Nta Rm 2.18
Dec 2015..Nta Rm 1.96
Dec 2014..Nta rm 1.82
Dec 2013 nta..rm 1.71
Dec 2012 nta ..rm 1.51
Dec 2011 nta..rm 1.38
Dec 2010 nta...rm 1.22
Dec 2009 nta ..rm 1.14
Insas Amazing Good Earnings & Value Creation Track records .
Insas has grown from Rm 1.14 NTA per share to Rm 2.99 per share in June 2021 & amazing capital gain of 162% over a period of about 12 yrs or a capital gain of 13.5% pa but if u factored in the dividend as well as u get a return above 14.5% pa loh!
Conclusion; Insas is a very great investment with equivalent to berkshire hathaway mah!
U just sleep well investing in insas loh!"

From account perspective, not all it's subsidiaries are exceeding 100M, then can minus them out from there to avoid this 1-time tax. Do bear in mind some of it's subsidiaries are enjoying tax incentive. So the impact should not be that bad, comparing to FSI, plantation & glove sectors.

In our view, the introduction of “Prosperous Tax” should have minimal impact on Malaysian OSAT like Inari-Amertron and Malaysian Pacific Industries (MPI). They still have pioneer tax exemption benefits that will last till 2023 for Inari and 2025 for MPI. However, Unisem could be the most affected by the potential increase in effective tax rate. We estimate the potential increase in tax expense could reduce Unisem’s 2022F EPS by 8-9%.We estimate Unisem derive 40%-45% of its earnings from Malaysian operation. Meanwhile we see muted impact towards Malaysian Automated Test Equipment (ATE) manufacturers given the lower earnings base, below the RM100m threshold set by the government. Overall, the Malaysian OSAT and Automated Test Equipment sector enjoys a relatively lower effective tax rate (vs. statutory tax rate)."

INARI WILL BE THE 1ST TECHNOLOGY STOCK TO BE INCLUDED IN THE KLSE 30 COMPONENT INDEX LOH!
THE COST OF INARI TO INSAS IS ONLY 46 SEN WHEREAS THE SHARE PRICE IS CLOSE TO RM 4.00 MAH!
Those who sell at Rm 1.00 to Rm 1.05 are just plain silly loh!
Can't they just hold & wait for 1 mth to let insas surge to reap good profit leh ?
Stay focus in insas your best bet mah!
Why Raider says Insas can be a strong growth stock ?
Bcos Insas has shown very consistent earnings growth support & value creation every year for the past years mah!
Insas is not a goreng stock, thus its share show steady appreciation consistently...thus over medium term, Insas will surely do better n gain better appreciation than most goreng stocks loh!
Just look at the amazing growth track record of value creation of insas for the past 10 yrs
June 2021- Nta Rm 2.99
Mar 2021 - Nta Rm 2.96
Dec 2020 - Nta Rm 2.83
Dec 2019- Nta Rm 2.68
Dec 2018- Nta Rm 2.54
Dec 2017..Nta rm 2.49

Dec 2011 nta..rm 1.38
Dec 2010 nta...rm 1.22
Dec 2009 nta ..rm 1.14
Insas Amazing Good Earnings & Value Creation Track records .
Insas has grown from Rm 1.14 NTA per share to Rm 2.99 per share in June 2021 & amazing capital gain of 162% over a period of about 12 yrs or a capital gain of 13.5% pa but if u factored in the dividend as well as u get a return above 14.5% pa loh!
Conclusion; Insas is a very great investment with equivalent to berkshire hathaway mah!
U just sleep well investing in insas loh!
Remember do not sell insas prematurely loh!
Insas CHIAK BEH LIAW !!
If u fear the high price of Inari, just buy insas for Inari exposure mah!
1000 insas is equivalent to 785 inari exposure mah!
That means u buy insas for Rm 1050 ....for Rm 3060 worth of inari share mah!
Btw this rm 3060 of inari value exclude other business value in insas share , that worth more than Rm 2600 per share mah!
Basically insas thereotical value per share is Rm 5660 per 1000 insas share loh!

That Means Insas hold 542m of inari worth Rm 2.16B mah!
Or equivalent to value Rm 3.06 per share of inari exposure per insas share.
That means Insas Net Assets of Rm 2.99 per share ....Rm 0.46 consist of Inari & Rm 2.53 per share comprises of other than Inari loh!
That means Insas can afford Inari share price to crash Rm 4.00 to zero per share, yet insas still can have intrinsic value of Rm 2.53 per share without inari loh!
That means with Inari Rm 2.16B value, in included in Insas is worth at least Rm 5.66 per insas share mah!
Thus U can see how safe insas is loh! ?
Furthermore inside Insas of Rm 2.53 per share ( exclude inari value} its cash per share alone exceeding Rm 1.30, thus its cash per share of Rm 1.30 already exceed insas current share price of rm 1.05 mah!

KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 10): RHB Retail Research said Insas Bhd is set continue its uptrend momentum after breaking past the immediate resistance of RM1.09 on high trading volume yesterday – printing a “higher high” bullish structure.
In a trading stocks note today, the research house said if the stock manages to stay above that level, the bulls may drive the stock towards the immediate resistance of RM1.20, followed by RM1.30.
“Conversely, falling below the RM1.04 support level – forming a “lower low” pattern – will cancel this expectation,” it said.

Healthy new products pipeline
■ Inari’s diversification into automotive is gaining traction with the potential maiden contribution from its newly-created SOM division at P55 in 1HCY22F.
■ Reiterate Add, with an unchanged RM4.95 TP, still based on 38x CY23F P/E.
1QFY6/22 results briefing
● We attended Inari-Amertron’s virtual 1QFY6/22 post-results briefing, hosted by Group CEO KC Lau this morning. We learnt that Inari’s new system-on-module (SOM) assembly division at P55 is on track to begin production in 1QCY22. SOM division is running a reliability testing process that could take up to 12 weeks before it can start production, but we are encouraged to learn Inari’s new customer is expediting the number of products qualified. We see SOM division as a new growth driver for Inari to diversify and grow its exposure in the automotive segment. We expect Inari to utilise a portion of placement proceeds for SOM division expansion from CY22F onwards.
Key takeaways
● The group is allocating RM100m capex for investment in new technology platform and capacity expansion and value-added processes such as electromagnetic interference (EMI) shield coating for RF chips. The group recently added two new system-inpackage (SiP) lines in Oct and Nov 21, which raised its total SiP assembly to 24 lines. In addition, Inari is also investing US$5.8m (RM24.4m) in a new double-sided molding packaging platform that could be utilised in the next generation RF chips in 2022/23F.
● The group expects utilisation in 2QFY6/22F to stay elevated, driven by RF content value growth going into 5G mobile devices. The group highlighted that its RF division’s utilisation is hovering close to 90% currently.
● Meanwhile the group does not expect a significant impact from the Makmur Tax implementation given that Inari’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Inari Technology Sdn Bhd which houses its RF division, still enjoys a pioneer tax exemption until 3QCY22F. The group is also looking to apply for new tax incentives with the commercialisation of newer RF chips for use in 5G mobile devices. The group is guiding for an average of 9-10% effective tax rate in FY22-23F, broadly in line with our expectations.
Reiterate Add and RM4.95 TP
● We reiterate Add, with an unchanged RM4.95 TP, still based on 38x CY23F P/E, which is 2 s.d. above its 3-year historical mean. We see an earnings-accretive outsource semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) JV in China, stronger-thanexpected RF chip demand, consensus earnings upgrades and new customer wins as potential re-rating catalysts for the stock. Slowing demand for 5G smartphones, ringgit appreciation vs. US dollar and delays in new customers’ diversification are key downside risks to our Add call."

Inari recorded its fifth consecutive yoy growth with a record-high profit, thanks to marvelous RF sales amid the 5G technology refreshment cycle. The group also executed its first multi-pronged growth strategy via horizontal integration, which will be done via a JV setup in China with CFTC for OSAT manufacturing in the China market. Further earnings-accretive M&A activities could uplift its market cap for the potential FBMKLCI inclusion. Maintain BUY with a higher target price of RM4.40."

INARI WILL BE THE 1ST TECHNOLOGY STOCK TO BE INCLUDED IN THE KLSE 30 COMPONENT INDEX LOH!
THE COST OF INARI TO INSAS IS ONLY 46 SEN WHEREAS THE SHARE PRICE IS CLOSE TO RM 4.00 MAH!
Those who sell at Rm 1.10 to Rm 1.20 are just plain silly loh!
Can't they just hold & wait for 1 mth to let insas surge to reap good profit leh ?
Stay focus in insas your best bet mah!
Why Raider says Insas can be a strong growth stock ?
Bcos Insas has shown very consistent earnings growth support & value creation every year for the past years mah!
Insas is not a goreng stock, thus its share show steady appreciation consistently...thus over medium term, Insas will surely do better n gain better appreciation than most goreng stocks loh!
Just look at the amazing growth track record of value creation of insas for the past 10 yrs
June 2021- Nta Rm 2.99
Mar 2021 - Nta Rm 2.96
Dec 2020 - Nta Rm 2.83
Dec 2019- Nta Rm 2.68
Dec 2018- Nta Rm 2.54
Dec 2017..Nta rm 2.49

Dec 2011 nta..rm 1.38
Dec 2010 nta...rm 1.22
Dec 2009 nta ..rm 1.14
Insas Amazing Good Earnings & Value Creation Track records .
Insas has grown from Rm 1.14 NTA per share to Rm 2.99 per share in June 2021 & amazing capital gain of 162% over a period of about 12 yrs or a capital gain of 13.5% pa but if u factored in the dividend as well as u get a return above 14.5% pa loh!
Conclusion; Insas is a very great investment with equivalent to berkshire hathaway mah!
U just sleep well investing in insas loh!
Remember do not sell insas prematurely loh!
Insas CHIAK BEH LIAW !!
If u fear the high price of Inari, just buy insas for Inari exposure mah!
1000 insas is equivalent to 785 inari exposure mah!
That means u buy insas for Rm 1200 ....for Rm 3170 worth of inari share mah!
Btw this rm 3170 of inari value exclude other business value in insas share , that worth more than Rm 2600 per share mah!
Basically insas thereotical value per share is Rm 5880 per 1000 insas share loh!

Sslee I remember when I attended my first INSAS AGM in 2017 to ask for better dividend the Executive director Dato Dr. TAN replied if you want dividend and share price appreciation then you can choose to invest in Inari. But if you choose to invest in Insas then we are here to grow Insas net worth and the performancce of share price is not our responsibility.
I should have invested in Inari then but since I already made my choice so let it be.

""If u invest in insas is like u r investing in inari mah!
1000 insas is equivalent to 785 inari exposure mah!""
Suppose James like Inari & he assess it is going to rise to between Rm 5.00 to Rm 6.00 loh!
Thus he use Rm 4180 to buy 1000 inari share loh!
John his colleague decide to invest in insas instead, he use the same amount of Rm 4180 and bought into 3540 insas shares loh!
Suppose after their purchase Inari Shares price move to Rm 6.00...then James will make Rm 1,820 or 43.5%
On the otherhand John will make following revenue 3540 x 0.785 x rm 6.00 = Rm 16,673.
Thus Profit John make is Rm 16,673-Rm 4180 = Rm 12,493 or 300% mah!

Good stock will be Inari, Hibiscus which is long term. Most said glove is in downtrend- a resounding yes but it also present an opportunity.

KUALA LUMPUR: There will likely be changes to the flagship index of Bursa Malaysia's 30 biggest companies next month, following FTSE Russell Malaysia's final semi-annual review for this year.
Hap Seng Consolidated Bhd might be taken out from among 30 constituents of Bursa Malaysia's benchmark FBM KLCI, according to Kenanga Research.
In its place will most likely be Inari Amertron Bhd.
Kenanga Research noted that Nov 22 was the cut-off date for the FTSE Russell Malaysia's final semi-annual review of 2021.
""Data as of yesterday's close will determine the updated constituents of the FBM Index series that will be published on Thursday 2nd December and to be implemented effective Monday 20th December.
""Among the big caps, we expect Hap Seng (unrated) to be removed from the FBM Index series on the grounds of falling below the required liquidity threshold,"" Kenanga Research's Koh Huat Soon said in a report yesterday.
At the closing prices as at Monday's cut-off date, Hap Seng was ranked 25th by market capitalisation. But the diversified group is likely to be disqualified on grounds of insufficient liquidity.
""The ground rules state that to remain in the FBM Index series, a member stock must turn over at least 0.04 per cent of its free-floating shares in issue, based on its median monthly trading volume for at least 8 of the 12 months prior to the semi-annual review.
""For Hap Seng, (its) trading liquidity fell below the required threshold towards the end of review period for five straight months. The median turnover exceeded 0.04 per cent only for six of the last 12 months. As such, it appears to us that Hap Seng has failed to satisfy the minimum liquidity threshold,"" Koh said.
Kenanga Research said Inari is currently the largest non-FBM KLCI constituent with the requisite free float and liquidity.
If admitted, Inari would be the sole technology component in the index, the firm added.
""Based on Inari's represented index shares of 2,275.58 million at the current price of RM4.24 versus Hap Seng's 649.52 million at RM7.70, we estimate that Inari would come in at around 1.97 per cent weight versus Hap Seng exiting at 1.03 per cent weight.
""The final figures will however, be based on closing prices on Friday, December 17, after which the new list will be first reflected at the start of trading on Monday, December 20,"" Koh said.
Kenanga Research said at RM4.24, Inari was the 30th largest by market capitalisation and the company needed to remain at least above 36th to avoid direct removal in the next review round.
""Whether Inari can remain in the FBM KLCI beyond just one semi- annual period would depend on, among others, whether it can remain above 36th position in size, dropping below which it will be dropped according to the rules,"" Koh said.
This was the case with Supermax Corp Bhd which fell off in the June 2021 review just six months after admission in December 2020.
""Our tech analyst Samuel Tan is bullish on Inari, setting a target price of RM4.80 (13 per cent upside), reinforcing our confidence that Inari is likely to remain in the FBM KLCI for the long haul,"" Koh added.

We learnt that Inari’s new system-on-module (SOM) assembly division at P55 is on track to begin production in 1QCY22. The SOM division is running a reliability testing process that could take up to 12 weeks before it can start production, but we are encouraged to learn Inari’s new customer is expediting the number of products qualified. We see the SOM division as a new growth driver for Inari to diversify and grow its exposure in the automotive segment. We expect Inari to utilise a portion of placement proceeds for the SOM division expansion from CY22F onwards.
The group is allocating RM100 million in capital expenditure for investment in new technology platforms and capacity expansion and value-added processes such as electromagnetic interference (EMI) shield coating for RF chips. The group recently added two new system-in-package (SiP) lines in October and November, which raised its total SiP assembly to 24 lines. In addition, Inari is also investing US$5.8 million (RM24.4 million) in a new double-sided moulding packaging platform that could be utilised in the next-generation RF chips in 22/23F."

Any tom, dick and harry can start glove manufacturing. And not forgetting China is also producing glove. We know China can really throw prices if they want to.
But chip production not so easy. Very capital intensive and high tech industry. Not many will be interested to join or compete.
Plus whether you like it or not, in the near future all items will need chip. EV car, household electrical items, office equipment, lab research etc.
Just a temporary setback by weak holders or contra players that do not have the foresight to look into the future. Only one news article of iphone slowing demand in one quarter and they panic sell.
Its a good time to buy for those who does not have this blue chip tech counter."

The provident fund’s stake in the company dropped below 5% after it disposed of 1.40 million shares on Nov 24, according to the filing.
The EPF had also traded in Inari shares on Nov 22 and 23, buying two million shares and selling 1.66 million.

Inari had been embarking on process automation since 2018.
Spent RM163mil that year itself for automation IR4.0 to reduce manual labour.
In 2020, Inari included capex for 2021 RM100mil for that purpose as well.
That's started since 3 years ago.

Planned investment of that quantum takes 2-5 years to materialized.
From factory development approval to fully furnished with equipment and human resource hiring and training.
Look at TSMC plan for Japan, US and Germany. Mass production only possible after 3-4 years after getting approvals."
