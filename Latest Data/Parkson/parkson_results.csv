http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1138642.shtml
thriving demand from the Chinese market for luxury skincare products bolstered the revenues of major cosmetics makers - including L'Oreal, Estee Lauder and Shiseido
Estée Lauder Sales Rise as Chinese Consumers Spend Big on Beauty
https://www.wsj.com/articles/estee-lauder-sales-rise-as-chinese-consum...
The New York-based company said sales in the Asia-Pacific market, led by China and Hong Kong, rose 20% from a year earlier to about $1 billion, offsetting weaker demand in North America. Estée Lauder Chief Executive Fabrizio Freda said the quarter’s strength indicated that broader concerns in China about its economy haven’t hurt consumer spending on higher-quality beauty products.
Prestige beauty has historically been less sensitive to economic downturns because it is a more-affordable luxury category and is driven by repeat purchases. Mr. Freda also noted that uniquely in China younger consumers are spending more than their parents on these products, and that as well helps guard the category against geopolitical and economic concerns."

The “new retail”, a new concept that integrates e-commerce and physical retail stores seamlessly, has flourished in China, with tech giants investing actively in physical retail companies to expand their offline presence. While the emergence of “new retail” has brought increasing challenges to the entire retail industry in China, the Group sees ample opportunities and positive signs ahead, in view of the gradual recovery of the retail market there as evident by the steady Gross Domestic Product growth rate in China.
The Group’s execution of transformation strategies involving the diversification of retail formats and optimisation of operations and omni-channel marketing has yielded encouraging returns. For the FYE 2018, Parkson China posted a positive SSS growth of 0.5% with revenue increasing to RM2,651 million. The higher revenue coupled with improved operating efficiencies have enabled Parkson China to turn profitable with an operating profit of RM111 million against a loss of RM42 million a year ago."

The Group’s efforts in optimising stores’ productivity and implementing cost rationalisation have yielded encouraging results which enabled the Group to register an operating profit of RM3 million for the FYE 2018 against a loss of RM142 million last year.
Overall, the Group reported a loss before tax of RM83 million for the FYE 2018 which included impairment losses on property, plant and equipment, an investment property, intangible assets, investments in associates and joint ventures, and receivables totalling RM89 million.
As at 30 June 2018, the Group’s total assets decreased by 8% to RM8,948 million whilst the Group’s total liabilities were reduced by 10% to RM5,340 million.

Parkson, which operates a network of 46 stores in 30 cities across China, said same-store sales (SSS) in the country contracted 3% in 1HFY19. Parkson’s operations in China contributed close about two-third of the group’s revenue.
“The retail market in China has seen slowdown amid macroeconomic headwinds resulting in Parkson China reporting a negative SSS growth of 3% during the period under review,” it said.
Despite this, Parkson China reported a marginally higher revenue of RM1.3bil for the six months ended Dec 31.
“The lower operating profit of RM29 million against RM32 million a year ago was mainly attributable to the negative SSS growth,” it said.
Meanwhile, Parkson Malaysia benefited from the buoyant consumer confidence resulting in a positive SSS growth of 5%. Operations, it said, reported a growth of 3% in revenue to RM522mil following the closure of underperforming stores.
“Savings arising from rationalisation of stores and improved operating efficiencies have resulted in operating loss narrowing considerably to RM1mil compared with RM15mil a year ago,” it said.
Parkson Malaysia has 45 stores as at Dec 31 with the opening of a new store in Sarawak in this quarter.

If not for the rough patch this stock went through these last few years, do you think we can buy it this cheap. No way. In fact, I can only buy so much today because it's so cheap. So, hold on to this gem and patiently wait for the retail cycle to return and you will see the rewards. They're in the right market in China for more than 20 years and they know the market well having seen it's ups and down. TSWC is passionate in his endeavour and committed to turning it around. In fact, parkson has been reporting operating profit for the last few quarters and you can expect the momentum to get better with the new retail formats to capture the younger effluent crowd which is ever willing to spend. In fact, the net loss experienced by Parkson has been to a large extend the payment of taxes. China is a very large market to be in and Parkson is a household name there and I'm sure parkson will grow in tandem with the recovery when it comes. Be patient and you will savour the sweet.victory in the not too distant future. Remember, Parkson is moving to the 2nd and 3rd tier cities where the market is more vibrant and they can unlock good value by disposing their appreciated assets in the 1st tier cities like Beijing and cash in on the big profits, if there is a need. Plenty of avenue for Parkson to raise huge cash flow when the situation present itself. So, stay invested in this stock and ignore the market noises, cheers."

PRGL had announced that on 26 February 2019, Parkson Retail Development Co., Ltd. (“Tenant”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of PRGL, and China National Arts and Crafts Group Company Limited (“Landlord”) entered into 7 new lease agreements in respect of the leasing by the Tenant from the Landlord of the properties in Beijing, the PRC (“New Lease Agreements”). Prior to entering into the New Lease Agreements, the Tenant had been occupying the Properties as tenant for its retail business since 1 October 1993 pursuant to the previous 7 separate lease agreements entered into between the Landlord and the Tenant which were in existence immediately prior to the New Lease Agreements.
Pursuant to the International Financial Reporting Standard 16 (IFRS 16) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, the entering into the New Lease Agreements as lessee will require the PRGL Group to recognise the premises as the right-of-use assets in which the aggregated amount was approximately Rmb393.9 million calculated with reference to the aggregated present value of the fixed lease payments as discounted using a discount rate which is equivalent to PRGL’s incremental borrowing rate during the entire terms of the New Lease Agreements, thus the entering into the New Lease Agreements and the transactions contemplated thereunder will be regarded as an acquisition of assets by the PRGL Group (“Acquisition of Assets”).
The entering into the New Lease Agreements constitutes a discloseable transaction for PRGL, and is subject to the reporting and announcement requirements but are exempt from the circular and shareholders’ approval requirements under Chapter 14 of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the HKEx.
The Acquisition of Assets does not have a material impact on the earnings of the Group for the financial year ending 30 June 2019 and the net assets of the Group based on the audited consolidated statement of financial position of the Company as at 30 June 2018."

His plans for MUI’s best known business venture — Metrojaya department stores — come at a tough time for the domestic retail sector. Indeed, MUI acknowledges this in its 2018 annual report. It says Metrojaya faces challenging retail conditions with increased competition from traditional retailers and online shopping portals, against a backdrop of uncertain consumer sentiment.
Andrew agrees that department stores as they stand today are becoming outdated and, hence, changes are needed.
“Department stores will have a dim future if we don’t make changes. We need to be open-minded and aggressive in changing the dynamics of the business. If this works, it could be a beacon of light for department stores in the future, but only time will tell,” he says.
“I am not ready to give up on the idea yet, but department stores as we know them must change. It could mean a reduced footprint ... smaller stores.”

PRA is the holding company for all the Parkson Stalls in Malaysia.

How did Ks55 manage predict that PRA is worth 1.5 cent at 11pm last night and it fell to 1.5 cent only this morning?
Who is Ks55? Is he related to the troubled Parkson Core Team or Some Fund Houses that are manipulating the stock prices with negative news in multiple forums and holding substantial shares to be able to move the prices, since the volume is low.
Whatever it is, till today, nobody knows who is Ks55.

Are you having some long-standing feuds with Parkson and its management or even William Cheng's Family?
Those negative comments are coming from you frequently and it seem that you are able to predict the drop in price.
Are there any conflicts within the Parkson Family/Team/Community that you are aware of and any consolidation of power and shares within several members within?
It seems that you belong to someone close or within the Parkson Group that is trying to destroy Parkson for some interests.
It's always easiest to destroy someone or something when they are at it weakest and most vulnerable.

於二零一九年首六個月，儘管中美貿易局勢持續緊張，中國零售市場仍然保持穩步增長。中
國經濟亦錄得國內生產總值增長6.3%，而通脹則為2.2%。雖然工業產出僅次上升6.0%，但零
售銷售額於本年首六個月按年上升 8.4%，超出預期。本集團相信，消費升級的趨勢將會在中
國持續，而消費將繼續是中國經濟的主要增長動力之一，故雖然預期經濟將持續受到宏觀局
勢和地緣政治因素影響，我們仍然對中國的消費市場前景保持樂觀。
於二零一九年上半年，本集團錄得銷售所得款項總額（「銷售所得款項總額」）人民幣 7,494.9
百萬元（含增值稅），較二零一八年同期下降 3.3%，主要由於關閉業績表現欠佳的門店的影
響。二零一九年上半年的同店銷售（「同店銷售」）下降 2.2%，主要由於中國經濟的持續放緩，
以及受到客流分流的影響。本集團的整體銷售毛利率上升至 22.0%，而二零一八年上半年則
為 21.5%，經營利潤為人民幣 357.1 百萬元，較去年同期增加 183.2%。"

Business Review
The Board delighted to report that the Group achieved stable performance in the first six
months of 2019. This is the result of our dedication to diversify our retail formats and
enhanced product offerings aimed at reinforcing our position as a leading lifestyle retailer in
China."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001080.jsp?ftp=197","Aug 23, 2019 1:24 PM","yucaihacai","Financial Results
During the first six months of 2019, the Chinese retail market maintained stable growth
despite continued trade tensions between China and the United States. China’s Gross
Domestic Product recorded a 6.3% growth in the period, while inflation was 2.2%. Although
industrial output slowed to 6.0%, retail sales growth was 8.4% in the first half of this year,
ahead of market expectations. The Group believes that the trend of consumption upgrade will
continue to prevail. Consumption is expected to remain the main driver of China's economic
growth. China's consumer market is expected to maintain a positive outlook regardless of the
macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges.
In the 1H2019, the Group recorded total gross sales proceeds (“GSP”) of RMB7,494.9
million inclusive of value added tax, a decline of 3.3% compared with the same period of last
year, which was mainly due to closure of underperforming department stores. Same store
sales (“SSS”) in 1H2019 decreased by 2.2%, reflecting the continued slowdown of the
Chinese economy and the diversion of customer traffic. The Group’s overall gross profit
margin increased to 22.0% from 21.5% in the same period last year, profit from operations
increased by 183.2% year-on-year to RMB357.1 million."

The rising consumer demand for quality products and service in the past several years has
bolstered innovation, which, in turn, has facilitated further development in the retail industry.
In order to stand out in the department store industry, one has to be innovative and dynamic.
In the first half year of 2019, Parkson continued diversifying its retail formats. This strategy
covers a range of areas, including the expansion of product categories such as more
international cosmetic brands, sports and apparel brands on top of traditional products, as
well as upgrading traditional supermarkets into gourmet supermarkets in department stores to
cater for rapid changing of consumer demands. We also work on the interconnectedness
between our businesses and further upgrading our product offering. The Group believes that
these measures will translate into a stable income in the future.
Known for their quality products and services, Parkson’s food and beverage (“F&B”) brands
also continue expanding their footprint. Thus, Hogan Bakery is expected to open a franchise
store in Fuzhou in the third quarter of 2019. Together with“雞薈”(Ji Hui) restaurant brand,
Parkson’s F&B continue to develop and launch more new products. One of our main
objectives is to provide a full spectrum of consumer experience, and that is why we are
committed to integrating the retail and catering businesses so that our customers can enjoy a
18
quality dining experience while shopping.
With consumption upgrading and demand for premium domestic and imported products
rising across second-tier and third-tier cities, we plan to open supermarkets in our department
stores in more places. In April 2019, we opened a new supermarket in Mianyang and expect
to open another new supermarket in the same city in the third quarter"

FY19 CNL of RM64m expanded, compared to CNL of RM31m in FY18, is deemed within expectations of both our/consensus estimated CNL of RM60.9m. Malaysian operation has returned to black with the on-going rationalization strategy and China operation recorded higher operating efficiencies (+40%). At the current pace, PARKSON is expected to be in the black with FY20E CNP of RM8.5m and we introduce FY21E CNP, which is higher by 16%. Upgrade to OP from UP with a higher TP of RM0.270 (from RM0.240) based on the revised SoP.
FY19 within expectations. FY19 CNL of RM64m expanded, compared to CNL of RM31m in FY18, is deemed within expectations of both our/consensus full-year estimate of RM60.9m each. No dividend was declared, as expected.
YoY, FY19 core losses expanded to RM64m compared to core losses of RM31m in FY18 mainly due to higher finance costs and higher tax expenses. This was despite marginally increase in revenue (+1.3%) due to improved SSS growth from: (i) Malaysia (+5.1% vs. FY18 of -1.2%) which benefited from the spending spree during the zero-rated tax holiday as well as strong festivities sales, and (ii) Indonesia (-1.4% vs. FY18 of -3.8%) mainly driven by the targeted promotions and increasing house brands’ contribution, which more than offset the lower SSS growth in China and Vietnam/Myanmar operations. China’s FY19 SSS growth was lower at -2.2% vs. +0.5% in FY18 mainly due to lower direct sales arising from stores closures in 2018 but improving operating revenue was seen from strong sales performance in the Cosmetics & Accessories category (51% of merchandise sales). On the other hand, Vietnam’s SSS growth rates (-20.5% vs. FY18 of -8.3%) sunk deeper due to intense competition, especially with the launch of Vincom Center Landmark 81 Mall. Nevertheless, 53%-owned Parkson China recorded higher operating efficiencies to report an operating profit of RM155m (+40%) and Malaysia operation recorded operating profit of RM14m from operating loss of RM47m, which more than offset other region’s losses to record EBIT of RM100m.
QoQ, 4Q19 returned to the black with core PATAMI of RM12.6m compared to core losses of RM6.5m in 3Q19 from improved operating efficiencies and stores productivity, as the group recorded higher operating profit of RM55m (+2.6%), mainly contributed by China and Malaysia operation following the closure of underperforming stores (Malaysian segment saw the closure of Parkson stores in Suria KLCC and Puchong Square M Mall in the quarter, and China closed 3 stores YTD). These more than mitigated lower turnover (-13%) due to higher base in the previous quarter from seasonally stronger consumer spending during the CNY festivities and extended holiday but cushioned by Hari Raya Aidilfitri sales in Indonesia (+42%).
Outlook. We like Parkson for the following; (i) its strategy of optimising its retail format, expanding its product and services offerings, which is paying off, (ii) it is minimising stores losses via optimising store effectiveness and efficiency, which are bearing fruits, and (iii) China operation’s improvement to gain further momentum. As of June 2019, the group’s department stores network comprises 44 stores in China and 61 stores in South-East Asia, including Malaysia (42 stores), Vietnam (4 stores), and Indonesia (15 stores). Note that, Parkson has ceased its Myanmar operation with the closure of its only store in 2Q19.
Upgrade to OP from UP with a higher TP of RM0.270 (from RM0.240) based on the revised Sum-of-Parts (SoP) (implied PER of 34x based on FY20E EPS, above regional PER of 27x). The share price has plunged 20% since our UP call and we believe most negatives have been priced in. Key risks to our call are: (i) higher-than-expected losses in the South-East Asia region, and (ii) slower-than-expected China operation.

Nevertheless, 53%-owned Parkson China recorded higher operating efficiencies to report an operating profit of RM155m (+40%) and Malaysia operation recorded operating profit of RM14m from operating loss of RM47m, which more than offset other region’s losses to record EBIT of RM100m.
QoQ, 4Q19 returned to the black with core PATAMI of RM12.6m compared to core losses of RM6.5m in 3Q19 from improved operating efficiencies and stores productivity, as the group recorded higher operating profit of RM55m (+2.6%), mainly contributed by China and Malaysia operation following the closure of underperforming stores (Malaysian segment saw the closure of Parkson stores in Suria KLCC and Puchong Square M Mall in the quarter, and China closed 3 stores YTD). These more than mitigated lower turnover (-13%) due to higher base in the previous quarter from seasonally stronger consumer spending during the CNY festivities and extended holiday but cushioned by Hari Raya Aidilfitri sales in Indonesia (+42%).
Outlook. We like Parkson for the following; (i) its strategy of optimising its retail format, expanding its product and services offerings, which is paying off, (ii) it is minimising stores losses via optimising store effectiveness and efficiency, which are bearing fruits, and (iii) China operation’s improvement to gain further momentum. As of June 2019, the group’s department stores network comprises 44 stores in China and 61 stores in South-East Asia, including Malaysia (42 stores), Vietnam (4 stores), and Indonesia (15 stores). Note that, Parkson has ceased its Myanmar operation with the closure of its only store in 2Q19.
Upgrade to OP from UP with a higher TP of RM0.270 (from RM0.240) based on the revised Sum-of-Parts (SoP) (implied PER of 34x based on FY20E EPS, above regional PER of 27x). The share price has plunged 20% since our UP call and we believe most negatives have been priced in. Key risks to our call are: (i) higher-than-expected losses in the South-East Asia region, and (ii) slower-than-expected China operation.

今天就浅谈昔日的蓝筹股怎么沦落成今日的仙家股。百盛集团(Parkson) 是一间零售连锁集团。百盛售卖的产品一般都有品味和时尚的知名品牌。百盛也有从事饮食，消费融资业务和投资控股领域。百盛集团在大马拥有42间零售店，中国用有44间，印尼和越南分别有16和4间。
随着网络时代来临，一台智能手机，一个购物平台就轻易的把百盛集团每年可赚取几亿令吉的生意给搞砸了。阿里巴巴(Alibaba) 的购物平台诞生彻彻底底打击了百盛集团在中国的业务。年轻一般的消费者都比较喜欢网购，因为方便，省时间，有折扣价甚至可以回退货物。百盛实体店面慢慢的变成了消费者试衣试裤的免费平台，然后上网购买便宜三四成同款货物。
网购的威力把百盛集团的股价给打败了。当年每股7块钱的百盛如今只剩下每股24.5仙。百盛集团真的只值这个价吗？我们来看看该集团如何为他的零售业止血。
开设Parkson Beauty概念店
Parkson Beauty 是一家为时尚，潮流，高端，品味的消费人群定位。Parkson Beauty 以美容，美妆为主，并配有美发，男性护肤等等。该集团已经引进多项知名品牌如Dior, Chanel, La Praines, Albion, Cucci等等。消费者如果想要美容，美发都要亲自去Parkson Beauty 实体店面才能享受此服务。网购平台是无法提供这些服务。
关闭表现不佳的广场或分行
百盛集团为调整集团的销售策略而关闭了三家在大马表现欠佳的分行和广场。该集团关闭了吉隆坡市中心Maju Junction 广场，金河广场分店和经营长达20年的吉隆坡中成阳光广场Suria Klcc的分行。关闭表现欠佳的分行或广场为该集团省了不少的开销。
我们在看看百盛集团的努力到底有没有帮到该零售业务止血。从季报看来关闭三家广场和分行不但没有降低营运额反而有稍微的增加主要是Parkson Beauty 的贡献。该集团的税后亏损明显的有在降低主要是改善营运效率。2019年，第四季报显示亏损明显的放大主要受到越南和印尼的零售业务放缓，中国饮食业务亏损。
股价24.5仙贵吗
随心认为只要该集团能转亏为盈的话，每股24.5仙是超便宜毕竟该集团总资产每股1.910令吉。资本投资（ICAP,5108）持有百盛集团的股票主要看到该公司的中国业务已经转好。整篇文章并没有任何买卖建议，单纯分享个人看法，本人不对你赢亏负认何责任"

Don't be misled by stupid idiots that Parkson is cash rich (probably now is 'cos recent disposal of asset in Beijing, but the money is held by PRGL not PHB).
Don't be misled by idiots PHB net asset is 2.70, just find out how much is its goodwill, and how this goodwill arises.

Positive: looks like abundant cash. High NTA hopefully not like london biscuits which turned into negative just in one quarter.
Negative: Faded business potential as retail market landscape changed totally but management and bod is too slow in response. HK business (HK parkson used to be above HK80, now less than 0.70) is expected to hit badly by non stop riots and significant weakening economy arising from the riots. Ability to raise MYR 2.1 b in HK is not a good news. Spore parkson is already under the watch list due to 3 years consecutive losses. Business in other countries most likely with poor if not poorer results. Management and bod incompetent to deliver under the current environment. As in Selangor, already highlighted as above.

Parkson in fact is undervalued. NTA nearly RM 1.80 not forgetting its property asset has yet to evaluate since year 2004 and 2008 worth of RM 5 Billion in China.
Actual NTA is nearly RM 2.50 i think.
No need to think so much, the fund manager has been spending so many years to bring down the price. Now they are full and it is now the time to bring the price up.

KUALA LUMPUR: The second extension of the movement control order to contain the Covid-19 outbreak — now totalling six weeks until April 28 — means that economic activities will remain subdued for at least another 14 days.
The pandemic, which has infected nearly two million and killed over 100,000 worldwide, presents the worst start possible for the recession expected ahead. As the infection curve has yet to near its peak, it is anyone’s guess on the depth of the economic downturn.
Against this backdrop, survival is the prominent concern now. Investors’ attention is drawn to companies’ balance sheets instead of growth prospects, which is widely expected to be minimal in the best-case scenario, as business volume dwindles and operating cash flow shrink.
Asia Analytica data shows that of some 880 listed companies (after excluding the 40 banks, insurers and investment trusts), 597 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia have cash that is less than their short-term liabilities.
Companies in many different sectors are underlined here, from furniture companies to retailers, automotive-related firms, and a wide range of manufacturers and trading companies.
Meanwhile, 223 listed companies have an interest cover ratio of below one times, meaning their earnings before interests and tax cannot cover interest expenses for a full year. The market capitalisation of most of these companies are below RM2 billion.
Some 321 companies were already in the red last year. Of the 599 profitable ones, around 45.6% of them saw profit decline in the period. Again, most on the list are small-cap firms, according to Asia Analytica data.
It is also worth noting that the economic downturn would be a tough test on companies’ sales quality. Companies with a high portion of credit sale with mounting receivables could be at risk amid the potential cash trap.
A random check shows that 75 listed companies or 8.2% have net gearing of over 100%. Sectors with the most companies in this category are logistics, construction, oil and gas, building materials and property development.
Others with net gearing of above 80% include power companies, telecommunications companies and building materials companies. Power producers’ liabilities are usually backed up by the steady cash flow from power purchase agreements.
On the flip side, notable sectors with low net gearing average include Internet and gas utility companies, and technology solution providers.
Of 79 generic companies with market capitalisation of above RM2 billion (ex-banks, real-estate investment trusts and insurers) only 22 have a cash ratio of above one times and net gearing of below 50%, led by Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd, Petronas Gas Bhd and IOI Corp Bhd.
As reflected by the price-to-book valuations, preference is given for companies with high cash, low debt, steady recurring income and high-quality clients, such as tech companies, and broadband providers.
There are also lesser-known small-cap companies that are cash-rich with sturdy past operations.
As a fund manager pointed out that a downturn is a brewing pot for merger and acquisition activities, as smaller, cash-rich companies with good assets or business prospects usually become undervalued after the market selldown.
The first quarter’s (1Q20) financial result will show how much cash was exhausted amid the two-week shutdown in the second half of March, while prospects of the entire half of 2Q20 being under movement restriction are still visible."

Based on Parkson Holdings cash of more than RM 2 billion, it will be so cheap for WC to take Parkson private. I hope WC consider this move to allow shareholders to exit at a fair price. This is because Parkson is worth much more than RM1.69 based on its latest book value on March 20. This is because there are Parkson owned malls worth more than their book value if these malls are disposed for profit in the future. Parkson can be repackaged and relisted later in the future if there is a need.
So, William Cheng if you follow this thread, you should consider this proposition as this is the best opportunity for you to take Parkson private at this ridiculously low liquidation price currently."

KUALA LUMPUR: Shares of Parkson Holdings Bhd￼fell over 8% in early trade Tuesday over a lease dispute.
The retailer fell 8.7%, or one sen to 10.5 sen with 1.22 million shares traded.
Singapore-listed Parkson Retail Asia Ltd's (PRA) Cambodian unit has been ordered to pay US$144.50mil as damages to Hassan (Cambodia) Development Co., Ltd as rental fee over the whole period of the lease under the agreement.
The unit, Parkson (Cambodia) Co. Ltd’s security deposit and all advanced rental payments paid to Hassan (Cambodia) amounting to US$4.48mil will also be forfeited.
This was based on a statement issued by PRA, a 67.96% owned subsidiary of Parkson Holdings.
The Phnom Penh Court granted judgement against Parkson Cambodia and ordered the forfeit and payment of damages.
PRA had in November 2018 and October 2019 announced that it had issued a notice of arbitration to Hassan (Cambodia) under the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) over the lease.
Parkson Cambodia is currently seeking advice from its Cambodian lawyers whether to petition to set aside the judgement, to appeal to the Cambodian Appellate Court or if other forms of recourse are available."

Reference is made to the announcements made by Parkson Holdings Berhad (“PHB” or the “Company”) on 15 November 2018 and 29 October 2019 in relation to the announcements made to the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) by Parkson Retail Asia Limited (“PRA”), a 67.96% owned subsidiary of the Company listed on the SGX-ST, in respect of the issuance of Notice of Arbitration to Hassan (Cambodia) Development Co., Ltd. (“Lessor”) and the update on the litigation in relation thereto (“Announcements”). Unless otherwise stated, the terms used throughout this announcement shall have the same meaning as defined in the Announcements. PRA had on 27 April 2020, announced that in its Unaudited Financial Statements for the Fourth Quarter and Twelve Months ended 30 June 2019 released on 27 August 2019, it had mentioned that despite the disputes between Parkson (Cambodia) Co., Ltd (“PCCO”) (a wholly-owned subsidiary of PRA) and the Lessor in relation to the Lease Agreement being pending arbitration under the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC Arbitration”) in Singapore, the Lessor had on 12 December 2018 filed a petition (“Case No. 2577”) in the Phnom Penh Municipal Court of First Instance (“Phnom Penh Court”). On 22 April 2020, the Phnom Penh Court granted judgement against PCCO in Case No. 2577 (“Judgement”) to, inter alia: 1. forfeit the security deposit and all advanced rental payments paid by PCCO to the Lessor amounting to USD4,488,750; and 2. order PCCO to pay damages of USD144,504,960 to the Lessor, being the rental fee for the whole period of the lease under the Lease Agreement. Prior to the Judgement, PCCO had filed an appeal motion to the Cambodian Appellate Court to transfer the jurisdiction of the Phnom Penh Court to hear Case No. 2577 to SIAC Arbitration jurisdiction. The appeal motion is currently pending in the Cambodian Appellate Court. PCCO is seeking advice from its Cambodian lawyers whether to petition to set aside the Judgement, to appeal to the Cambodian Appellate Court or if other forms of recourse are available. The Judgement is only applicable against PCCO and does not extend to PRA, PRA’s other subsidiaries nor its holding companies. The PRA Group’s maximum potential exposure resulting from the Judgement will therefore be limited to its capital contribution in PCCO which had been fully provided for in the audited financial statements of PRA for the financial year ended 30 June 2017. As stated in PRA’s announcement dated 15 November 2018, the PRA Group had in its audited financial statements for the financial years ended 30 June 2016, 2017 and 2018 recognised the impairment losses in connection with, inter alia, the full amounts of prepaid rental, rental deposit and property, plant and equipment in respect of the Cambodia Store. Accordingly, the Judgement, even if not successfully reversed or appealed against by PCCO, is not expected to have a material impact on the earnings per share and the net tangible assets per share of the PRA Group for the financial year ending 30 June 2020. PRA will make further announcements as and when there are material developments on the above matter. The Judgement does not have a material impact on the earnings of the PHB Group for the financial year ending 30 June 2020 and the net assets of the PHB Group based on the audited consolidated statement of financial position of the Company as at 30 June 2019.

Out of 100 retailers, including those in Sabah and Sarawak, Retail Groups MD Tan Hai Hsin is expecting “not more than 10%” of mall tenants to close versus “closures as high as 30%” for those located outside malls.
PETALING JAYA: Even as Malaysia moves into recovery mode with more businesses allowed to operate under the movement control order (MCO) period, retail stores had already started to close three to four weeks ago, Retail Group Malaysia said.
Out of 100 retailers, including those in Sabah and Sarawak, its managing director Tan Hai Hsin is expecting “not more than 10%” of mall tenants to close versus “closures as high as 30%” for those located outside malls.
Tan, who is also managing director of Henry Butcher Retail, said there were more retailers located outside mall settings than within.
Henry Butcher is a retail property consultancy, while Retail Group Malaysia is an independent research consultancy.
Since March 18, when the MCO was implemented, there have been reports that as many as 51,000 retail stores out of a total supply of 325,000 will be closing. He is sticking to that figure.
“We can expect about 15% of the total retail supply, or at least 51,000 stores, to close down in Malaysia within the next five to seven months.
“This crisis will lead to the survival of the fittest, ” Tan said.
Under the present recovery mode, Tan said “malls and commercial centres will benefit as more of them are allowed to open”.
“Consumers will adjust to this ‘new normal’ or new lifestyle. Inconvenient (as it may be), they will bear with it. This is evident from the crowds at Mid Valley Mega Mall, Sunway Pyramid in Bandar Sunway, One Utama Mall in Petaling Jaya and IKEA Cheras during the last one to two weeks.
“Malls and commercial centres will benefit when more businesses are allowed to open, ” he said.
As with everything, there will be winners and losers. Already, some had started to close during the second and third weeks of May, Tan said.
He said there are more “for sale” or “for lease” banners found in many shop offices and commercial centres throughout the country. “Many of these retailers are also looking for buyers for their retail businesses, ” Tan said.
Dividing retailers operating inside and outside of malls, Tan said the majority of tenants in shopping centres in Malaysia were national chain retailers and established retail operators.
“They have more resources to ride through the crisis. In addition, they also have more bargaining power with the landlords compared to those located in shop offices, commercial centres and commercial buildings, ” he said.
For retailers located outside of malls, most of them are located in shop offices, commercial centres and commercial buildings. These are the small-scale independent retailers and they are one of the most affected businesses during this crisis, he said.
Tan said these individual shop owners are “most likely to be cash-strapped” due to this period.
“We expect many of them to close down in the next three months. Many of them have shut down their stores during the last few weeks, ” Tan said.
The off-shoot of closures among non-mall retail stores is that as more operators and owners throw in the towel, this will affect shop rentals, which are already under pressure due to the excess supply.
According to the National Property Information Centre (Napic), as at the first quarter of 2020, the number of unsold completed shops in the country had risen to 6,042 units at a value of RM4.87bil, up from 5,472 units or RM4.50bil a year ago.
These shops, according to Napic, may range from one to 5½ storeys high. They may be semi-detached, detached or stratified units.
There was a time about a decade or so ago when shop investments were a much sought-after investment, especially corner lots because banks, coffee shops and some fast-food chains had a preference for them.
Be it corner or intermediate lots, being business operators or part of a larger chain, they committed to leases which were of a longer duration than housing tenants.
But the pandemic has laid bare the many weaknesses in the different segments of the property market.
As more non-mall retail stores are shuttered, this will add to the vacancies, even as more unsold completed shops enter the market."

KUALA LUMPUR (June 11): Malaysia's sales value of wholesale and retail trade plunged 36.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) in April 2020, which was the biggest decline in history after recording a decrease of 5.7% in March 2020, according to the Department of Statistics Malaysia.
Chief statistician of Malaysia Datuk Seri Dr Mohd Uzir Mahidin further said that in the normal business environment, it is estimated that the sales of wholesale and retail trade fell RM45 billion in April 2020.
""The steepest fall was recorded by motor vehicles which plummeted -93.2%, mostly due to precipitous drop in sales of motor vehicles of -93.7%. During MCO (Movement Control Order), car dealership centres and showrooms were not allowed to operate, thus affecting the sales of vehicles to customers,"" he said in a statement today.
However, it is noted that online retail sales continued to record a significant increase at 28.9% in April 2020, indicating the expansion of e-commerce activities.
Retail trade recorded a y-o-y decline of 32.4% to RM28.3 billion, as the imposition of the MCO since March 18 has resulted in negative growth for most retail activities.
""The main declines were observed in retail sales in specialist stores (-56.8%), retail sales of automotive fuel (-56.3%), retail sales of cultural"

Even Vincent Tan buys back his companies shares regularly. Why William Cheng is not doing anything? Wonder why Parkson is not doing share buy back at this ridiculously low price?

It will be irresponsible of the management to not defend the share price by at least performing share buyback when Parkson is selling at liquidation prices.

Revenue contracted 3% to RM677.99 million in 4Q, from RM698.94 billion in 3Q, according to the departmental store operator’s filing with Bursa Malaysia.
The latest net loss compares with a net loss of RM42.13 million a year earlier (4QFY19), on revenue of RM954.32 million.
This is the group’s ninth loss-making quarter. Its last profitable quarter was 3QFY18, when it reported a net profit of RM25.30 million.
For the full financial year ended June 30 (FY20), Parkson’s net loss expanded to RM427.28 million from RM129.18 million a year ago (FY19), as revenue fell 19.36% to RM3.25 billion from RM4.03 billion.
On a positive note, the group said it had posted an operating profit of RM44 million in 2QFY20, compared with the RM57.92 million operating loss recorded in 1QFY20, driven by operations in China.
Operations in the Chinese market saw an uptick in terms of profitability, where it recorded a higher profit of RM89.48 million in 2QFY20, rising 45% compared with RM61.82 million in 2QFY19.
The group said it maintains a positive outlook on the retail industry in China.
With the effective control of the pandemic and the implementation of various measures to stimulate consumer spending, China's retail market has recovered gradually with consumer consumption picking up steadily.
Nonetheless, the group said it will continue to adopt an active and cautious strategy and diversify its business development by exploring various operation models to broaden its income sources.
As for the Southeast Asian region, Parkson said the operating environment is expected to remain challenging, amid competition and the Covid-19 pandemic.
The group has nevertheless taken various measures to weather the impact of Covid-19, as well as the challenges ahead. Much emphasis will be placed on cost containment, improving stores' productivity and optimising operational efficiency to improve results, it said.
Parkson’s share price closed up 0.5 sen or 5.56% higher at 9.5 sen today, valuing the group at RM101.39 million. Some 9.24 million shares were traded. Over the past 12 months, the counter has been trading between seven sen and 26 sen."

Why???? It is because of this stupid Cambodian debacle arranged by corrupt people to issue a ridiculous award in favour of the plaintiff when they were clearly the culprit. Now that the Tribunal has overturned the decision and awarded compensation to Parkson, it is hoped that the poor perception can be cleared although Parkson had strenuously stated that the liability to PHB was negligible and impaired in the books in prior years. So, what's next? I think William Cheng lost a golden opportunity to at least do a share buyback at fire sale prices. Better still, he should have launched a takeover of the remaining shares not owned by him and parties acting in concert. Even a Novice businessman would have done it. No point keeping the listing when the market do not accord any reasonable value to the business and assets owned by Parkson. Why keep Parkson listed at this ridiculous price??? Might as well delist and repackage to relist later when market favours the Retail business again. Wonder what William Cheng has up his sleeves as it seem very disappointing. Best to step down as CEO if the right decision for the good of the company is not coming. Maybe, one of his daughters can assumed the role and do justice for the minority shareholders, cheers."

Description
Announcement by Parkson Retail Asia Limited - Update on Legal Proceedings involving Parkson (Cambodia) Co., Ltd
Reference is made to the announcements made by Parkson Holdings Berhad (“PHB” or the “Company”) on 15 November 2018, 29 October 2019, 27 April 2020 and 21 May 2020 in relation to the announcements made to the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (“SGX-ST”) by Parkson Retail Asia Limited (“PRA”), a 67.96% owned subsidiary of the Company listed on the SGX-ST, in respect of the issuance of Notice of Arbitration to Hassan (Cambodia) Development Co., Ltd. (“Lessor”) and the update on the litigation in relation thereto (“Announcements”). Unless otherwise stated, the terms used throughout this announcement shall have the same meaning as defined in the Announcements. On 15 September 2020, PRA had announced that it was informed on even date that Parkson (Cambodia) Co., Ltd (“PCCO”)'s lawyers had received the final award (“SIAC Award”) from the tribunal hearing the SIAC Arbitration (“Tribunal”) (“PRA Announcement”). The Tribunal had found, inter alia, that the Lease Agreement was lawfully terminated by PCCO, and has ordered the Lessor to pay to PCCO approximately SGD10,641,471, which includes: 1. security deposit of USD2,463,750 (approximately SGD3,363,167); 2. advance rental of USD2,025,000 (approximately SGD2,764,247); 3. costs and expenses incurred by PCCO of USD2,692,253 (approximately SGD3,675,087) which has been wasted as a result of the Lessor’s breach of the Lease Agreement; and 4. costs and expenses of the SIAC Arbitration, and legal fees and various disbursements and expenses incurred in connection with the proceedings of approximately SGD838,970. A copy of the PRA Announcement is attached herewith. Following the receipt of the SIAC Award, PCCO will continue to work closely with its Cambodian lawyers, and PRA will make the relevant announcements as and when there are material developments. The SIAC Award does not have a material impact on the earnings of the PHB Group for the financial year ending 30 June 2021 and the net assets of the PHB Group based on the audited consolidated statement of financial position of the Company as at 30 June 2019.

2016年5月03日, 鍾廷森接受《The Edge財經日報》專訪時，不否認公司股價受打壓
为什么受打壓? 他不敢解释
1. Parkson lost 36m Q3.
Net lost attributed to share holder 25.5m
Maju Junction 3 month loss 5m, 6 months loss 11m.
So total losses from Maju Junction (only 9 months) is estimated to be 15m for FYE2016.
http://www.bursamalaysia.com/market/listed-companies/company-announcem...
2. Lion Industries lost 130m Quarter ending 31 Mac 2016.
Lost attributed to share holders stood at 115m.
Lost per share 16.5 sen.
http://www.bursamalaysia.com/market/listed-companies/company-announcem...
3. LionForest Industries lost 54m Quarter ending 31 Mac 2016

4. Lion Diversified lost 34m Quarter ending 31 Mac 2016
http://www.bursamalaysia.com/market/listed-companies/company-announcem...
5. Lion Corp lost 91m Quarter ending 31 Mac 2016
http://www.bursamalaysia.com/market/listed-companies/company-announcem...
6. With all meow-meow losing money, and not able to pay dividend, how WC going to pay interest on margin finance of his pledged securities to tune of 20m to 50m a year?
7. Also take note Parkson derives its valuation from these two operating units. They are selling dirt 'cheap' now, and should be going down some more.
PRGL at HK$0.69 - record low, will break its own record again.
PRA at S$0.1580 - near record low, can make record any time.
Sum of Parts (SOP) is at 69 sen.
With 30% discount attached to holding company (as safety margin), safe to buy at not more than 50 sen.
8. WC has been selling Parkson share at around 91 sen.
WC sold 10.35M Parkson shares on 12.04.2016, 2.06M on 14.04.2016, and 2.18M on 20.04.2016 and 5.3m on 26.04.2016.

9. Meaning that either he think the share already overvalued, or he has to get some money to pay interest, or the pledged shares were forced sold, or he invite all meow-meow share-holders to go holland together with him.
10. All Lion meow-meow face potential forced selling by the creditors.
This include Parkson shares.
11. Parkson rests on yesteryears business model. No hope for any turn around at least in next 3 years.
12. Share Buy-backs are weakening the balance-sheets even of the most cash-rich firms.
Is Parkson really cash rich? How about 89.39m interest paid for 9 months on 2.49 billion borrowings? Since 2008, WC already used up 2.1 billion to buy back Parkson shares, otherwise he could have saved 75m on interest payment for 9 months.
13. Parkson share buy-back has become a kind of corporate cocaine that induces a temporary feeling of invincibility but masks weakness and vacuity. It has become a norm for any punter to buy by 4.30pm, then park to sell at 4.49pm. WC is going to pay these punters 'toll' to push up closing price everyday. He cannot stabilize Parkson share price with such tactic, but just draining the valuable cash.
Worst still it become clear for WC to commit suicide by drinking sea water in the ocean to quench thirst (飲鳩止渴).
Sooner or later Parkson is going to bleed to death.
14. Please don't tell me WC cannot understand the logical reasoning above. To me, he is paying peanuts to get monkeys to run his business empire -- from the very top to the sales personnel.
Don't believe, just go to any Parkson outlet to see what are the sales girls doing......"

Parkson didn’t do anything wrong, but somehow, it lost.
Sales on Singles day (11.11) by Alibaba (USD 14.3 billion or RM 60 billion) is equivalent to 5.04 times PHB Gross Sales Proceeds (RM 11.9 billion) for the whole financial year of 2015.
WC need not do anything wrong, by not doing anything right, he is bringing Parkson to holland just like Nokia.
PRA is now at S$0.156. It simply reflects how Singaporean think of the future for traditional departmental stores like Parkson.
I wish to reiterate, Parkson share valuation is only worth 75 sen, taking into consideration of PRA and PRGL current share price.
With 30% discount for holding company, plus yesteryear business model, plus risk of forced selling by Affin Hwang (Penang) on WC pledged securities, safe bet on Parkson is 50 sen.
It is now up to you to rebut my opinion as stated above. I am more willing to accept reasonable argument rather than statement like WC can buy back more share cheap-cheap at 50 sen. I am still skeptical about the wisdom of share buy back at 4.50pm each day. To me, it amounts to manipulation of closing price to avoid further margin calls. Any form of manipulation of share price is a criminal offence regardless its motive. Repco Lau went to jail for 5 years on similar offence............"

Parkson is a good case study.
It is drifting downwards without any support level, everyday low just like Tesco slogan.
You know characteristics of drifting counter?
Unless sudden sharp fall with a surge in volume (associated with forced selling), or WC step down, or WC decide to sell all PRGL assets, or PRA sold to third party, or engaging external management consultant like Mc Kinsey to have organization restructuring, share price will drift downwards everyday.
Why not WC using internal management team to conduct organization restructuring?
Reasons:
1. Interference from WC.
2. Internal management teams are paid peanuts, so all are monkeys. Monkeys can only run monkey business.
3. Management consultants will be made accessible to all business entities within the group. What asset to dispose off, what asset to merge, how to cut operating cost, how to improve cash flow via fresh capital infusion, which dead wood to be removed, how to enforce and strengthen company policy statements, how to make CEO responsible and accountable, how to down size and optimization.
4. Management consultants will just make recommendations.
They will have lesser consideration on one off losses, but more on turn around.
Implementation all depends on will and wisdom of WC.
5. WC should place more trust on external expert recommendation, rather than seeking advice from his internal management team (all monkeys because paid with peanuts). Monkeys cannot give creative and innovative business direction. They just follow typical business model from book."

PARKSON HOLDINGS BERHAD
Type Announcement
Subject OTHERS
Description Announcement by Parkson Retail Group Limited - Major Transaction: Formation of Joint Venture
We attach herewith the announcement made to The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (""The HKEx"") on 16 October 2020 by Parkson Retail Group Limited (""PRGL""), a 54.97% owned subsidiary of the Company listed on The HKEx, in relation to the major transaction on the formation of a joint venture.
On 16 October 2020, PRGL had announced that Shanghai Shengrui Commercial Management Co., Ltd., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of PRGL, and Hongxiang Real Estate Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hongxiang Holding Group Co., Ltd., had on 15 October 2020 entered into a joint venture cooperation agreement (""Joint Venture Cooperation Agreement"") to establish the joint venture to jointly locate suitable land resources within Jiaxing City of Zhejiang Province in the People's Republic of China for future development and construction of properties on such land resources (""Joint Venture"").
As one or more of the applicable percentage ratios in respect of the consideration under the Joint Venture Cooperation Agreement are more than 25% but all of such ratios are less than 100%, the entering into the Joint Venture Cooperation Agreement constitutes a major transaction of PRGL under Chapter 14 of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The HKEx (""Listing Rules"") and is therefore subject to announcement, circular and shareholders' approval requirements under Chapter 14 of the Listing Rules. In this regard, the written approval of certain shareholders interested in an aggregate of 1,448,270,000 ordinary shares of HK$0.02 each, representing approximately 54.97% of the total number of issued shares of PRGL, has been accepted in lieu of holding a general meeting of PRGL pursuant to Rule 14.44 of the Listing Rules.
The formation of the Joint Venture does not have a material impact on the earnings of the Group for the financial year ending 30 June 2021 and the net assets of the Group based on the audited consolidated statement of financial position of the Company as at 30 June 2020.

Aeon is already up , Bonia is up , Padini is also up. Parkson will be another Pandemic Recovery companies for 2021. Parkson operates retail stores in Malaysia, the People’s Republic of China, Vietnam, Myanmar, and Indonesia.
Over the weekend, Jack gave Mabel a Fantastic Insight of China. He was very passionate about investing in China. Parkson China is currently doing well and it's helping the Group. In addition, Parkson owned subsidiary Parkson Retail Group Ltd has entered into an agreement with Hongxiang Real Estate Co Ltd to establish a joint venture to jointly locate suitable land resources within Jiaxing city of Zhejiang province in China for future development and construction of properties on such land resources. Forecast future growth of Retailing is 40.7%.
For your information, Parkson's distribution channel compliments Mabel Innature Body Shops.
Mabel Body Shop’s customer loyalty programme, Love Your Body™, has 298,999 active members in Malaysia and 43,352 active members in Vietnam. Love Your Body™ members contributed appropriately 71.0% of annual sales in Malaysia and 66.4% of annual sales in Vietnam..
Mabel loves potential turnaround companies as it usually gives the best capital appreciation over relatively short period of time. Parkson is forecasted to move back to profitability in 2021. So this will be another purrfect turnaround stories just like Mabel collection of Battleships.
PARKSON is currently unprofitable but has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years, due to free cash flow being positive and growing by 33.2% per year. They have narrowed down their losses. Currently it is trading 98% below Fair Value, all thanks to the Pandemic.
Thank you for selling...

For long term investor, Buy below 20 sen is safe price to entry, you can enjoy rebound , but the main investment purpose is the transformation plan. It take few years to get back to the right road. Thanks to MCO, long term investor can enjoy lower entry price.
The cash flow ok, lost narrow down.
Aeon share price close to its book value.
Parkson share price big discount to book value due to lost money few years...
When they start make money, take book value discount 50% is 70 sen.
But business take year to build, so prepare to hold long term.
Business also got risk, you can enjoy the rebound, left the free share to enjoy the transform.
If successful, it is 10 bagger

From heated local tourism to surging dining and online shopping, China saw a consumption boom that was above the expectations of many during the weeklong Spring Festival holiday, and experts said the trend should continue after COVID-19 vaccines become widely available in mid-2021.
The boom was not all usual, particularly after China's efforts to discourage people from going back home during the Spring Festival to prevent a resurgence of the pandemic - a move that raised some worries about lackluster consumption.
The positive results, however, were better than many people thought and are read as another signal of China's economic strength.
In the tourism sector, which many believed would take a serious hit from the stay-put order, certain cities still saw tourist numbers surge compared with last year's Spring Festival holiday.
Beijing's key tourism sites, for example, received 3.7 times as many people as they did in last year's Spring Festival holiday, while their revenues skyrocketed nine times year-on-year and were even 1.9 times higher than the 2019 holiday.
Shanghai's tourist numbers almost recovered to the level seen in 2019, showing that the tourism market almost returned to pre-pandemic level.
The booming tourism business greatly boosted hotel room bookings, as many hotels, such as those in suburban Beijing, were fully booked for the holiday. Rooms in Shanghai's Disneyland were also entirely booked for this year's New Year's Eve, according to data sent by tourism service provider qunar.com to the Global Times.
This apparently shows a trend of improving after China's tourism market slumped amid the coronavirus hit.
Tourism during the holiday showed a significant increase from last year, and it almost reached 90 percent of the 2019 level in terms of visits and revenue, Xu Xiaolei, marketing manager at China's CYTS Tours Holding Co, told the Global Times on Thursday.
""With the development of vaccines and an increase in epidemic prevention and control measures in place this year, we expect tourism for the coming Qingming Festival holiday may be the same as 2019,"" Xu predicted.
Consumers also spent lavishly on other activities such as dining and shopping during this year's Spring Festival. According to data monitored by the Ministry of Commerce, China's key retail and dining enterprises saw revenues grow 28.7 percent year-on-year to 821 billion yuan ($127 billion) from February 11-17.
A Shanghai resident surnamed Dai said that his family dined out at restaurants three times during this year's Spring Festival holiday, spending 1,500 yuan on food each time.
""We usually wouldn't spend so much dining out during Spring Festival, but as we canceled travel plans this year, we dined out more to compensate,"" he told the Global Times.
The rising spending on tourism and other activities came as sporadic outbreaks of the coronavirus were put successfully under control. China has now cleared all high-risk COVID-19 areas.
Cong Yi, a professor at the Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, said that China has around 400 million people with middle-class or higher income levels, which shows a clear trend of consumption structural upgrading.
""We believe that China is a market with massive potential and resilience, with a solid consumer base and an upgrading trend,"" Cong told the Global Times.
Cong predicted that China's consumption would show a strong rebound this year, particularly after COVID-19 vaccines become widely available in May or June.
""After the pandemic is put under control completely, all sectors including consumption and investment would show a robust recovery in China,"" he said.
China's unexpectedly strong consumption growth was also in stark comparison to the US market, which presented a gloomy picture of consumer sentiment, global research data showed.
Ipsos' February index of global consumer confidence noted that China's consumer index surged 6.5 points year-on-year to 71.8 for February 2021, the largest growth among the 24 monitored economies. In comparison, the US' consumer sentiment index decreased 12.6 in February from one year earlier, the largest drop among all countries.

(March 15, 2021 12:48 pm +08)
BEIJING (March 15): China's factory and retail sector activity surged in the first two months of the year, beating expectations, as the economy consolidated its brisk recovery from the coronavirus paralysis of early 2020.
While the impressive set of numbers released on Monday were heavily skewed by the very low base from last year's massive slump, analysts said they nonetheless showed China's strong rebound remained intact.
Industrial output rose 35.1% in the first two months from a year earlier, up from a 7.3% on-year uptick seen in December, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed, stronger than a median forecast for a 30.0% surge in a Reuters poll of analysts.
Retail sales increased 33.8%, also faster than a forecast 32% rise and marking a significant jump from 4.6% growth in December and a 20.5% contraction for January-February of 2020.
""We have a positive outlook for exports and manufacturing investment this year,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics and Oxford Economics. ""And we expect household consumption to become a key driver of growth from Q2 onwards as confidence improves and the government’s call to reduce travel is toned down.""
China's ability to contain the coronavirus pandemic before other major economies were able to do so has allowed it to rebound faster.
In 2020, it was the only major economy to report positive annual growth, with an expansion of 2.3%.
The recovery has been driven by robust trade, pent-up demand and government stimulus.
Export growth hit a record pace in February while factory gate prices posted their biggest expansion since November 2018.
China’s economic activity is normally distorted in the first two months because of the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in February in 2021.
Modest expectations
Despite the statistical noise in the latest data, other measures show a broad-based recovery with industrial output up 16.9% and retail sales growing 6.4% compared with the first two months of 2019.
However, Liu Aihua, an NBS spokeswoman, warned that while positive factors for China's economy are increasing, the foundation for the recovery is not yet solid.
""Covid-19 is still spreading around the world and global economic conditions are complex and severe; domestically the imbalances of the recovery are still quite obvious,"" Liu told a briefing in Beijing.
The country saw scattered Covid-19 outbreaks re-emerge earlier this year, but brought them under control by early February.
Surveyed urban unemployment reversed a steady decline and rose to 5.5% in February from 5.2% in December, indicating increasing pressure on China's job market.
While millions of workers normally travel home over the Lunar New Year holiday, many stayed put this year due to Covid-19 fears. That kept factories humming over the period, but it also had some impact on consumer spending.
Seasonally adjusted month-on-month data showed retail sales growth actually fell in January-February, likely due to both travel restrictions but also elevated unemployment, analysts at Capital Economics said in a note.
Fixed asset investment increased 35% in the first two months from the same period a year earlier, slower than a forecast 40.0% jump. That compared with 2.9% on-year growth in 2020, and a 24.5% plunge in January-February last year.
Investment grew 3.5% compared with the first two months of 2019.
Private-sector fixed-asset investment, which makes up 60% of total investment, rose 36.4% in January-February, versus a 1.0% increase for the full year of 2020.
Beijing this month set a modest annual economic growth target, at above 6%, well below analysts' consensus forecast of more than 8% this year.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said last week the focus for growth this year is on consolidating the economic recovery.
Zhang Yi, chief economist at Zhonghai Shengrong Capital Management, said the recovery seen in month-on-month indicators may have already peaked, a sign momentum is slowing.
However, he expects infrastructure to receive a boost from still accommodative fiscal policy while exports are likely to maintain growth as the world economy opens.

March 30, 2021, 4:23 PM GMT+8
~ Ambitious target of 10 million doses a day will have to be met
~ Consumption, tourism and business confidence will benefit
China’s ambitious plan to vaccinate 40% of its population by the end of June could pave the way for lifting the economy’s growth rate to 9.3% this year, Oxford Economics forecast.
Business confidence and consumer spending will improve should China be able to achieve its targeted rate, which Oxford Economics estimates will require inoculating 10 million people a day -- twice the current pace. If Beijing is able to maintain that rate in the quarter through September as well, it could translate into some form of herd immunity, with 60% to 70% of the population vaccinated.
This would translate into a 0.4 percentage point gain to the gross domestic product growth rate from Oxford Economics’s 8.9% baseline scenario, which assumes five to six million doses are administered per day, according to its report released Tuesday.
Household consumption this year could increase by 7% from its pre-Covid level in 2019, while export of tourism services will recover to about 50% of its 2019 level in the second half of the year, and imports of tourism services will recover around 70%. Fixed investment will also improve, the research institution said.
China’s vaccination drive has so far lagged the U.S. and European countries, with only 107 million of its residents, or 3.8% of the population, being administered the shots. The government’s successful containment of the virus had previously made it cautious about pushing for vaccination.
In a worse-than-expected scenario, where only 40% of population will be vaccinated by the end of the year, economic growth could end up 0.2 percentage points lower from the baseline case at 8.7%, the report said.
“While China’s economic outlook depends less on the speed of vaccine rollout than other countries’ do, it does matter for a ‘full’ return to normalcy domestically and to close the immunity gap with other countries, which will allow China to open its borders safely,” Tommy Wu, lead economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in the report.
Economists expect China’s GDP to expand 8.5% this year, based on median forecast of a Bloomberg poll.

PARKSON Holdings Bhd surprised investors and analysts when it announced on July 15 that it would be undertaking an internal reorganisation of its group structure that would see its 67.6% Singapore-listed Parkson Retail Asia (PRA) moved to its 52.7% Hong Kong-listed Parkson Retail Group Ltd (PRGL).
Parkson is expected to report a profit next quarter. PRA and PRGL both reported profits. Price should go back above 20 sen easily when result is announced soon, cheers.

Indonesian subsidiary is left to rot/ bankrupt by action of its creditor. Without one off gain from deconsolidation, you should work out how much is the net loss.
All Parkson in KL and Selangor still close for business until 20 August. I am not sure if these stalls already opened for business or not. Too scare to die for no reason.

Then I got fed-up. I change my strategy, I just look-out for potentially big ones... just buy and wait... then one big hit in few years. Then find another one, another big hit in few years without doing anything. These big hit are not 100% or 200%, they are usually several thousand %
If you do not believe what I say can work, go and look at the historical share price of most of the good companies, how you wish you have foresight... many of them are dirt cheap, that is before they move. The tricky part is, can you hold long enough to get the rewards ( ignoring all the ups and downs )

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001080.jsp?ftp=238","Sep 10, 2021 5:51 PM","Felixck","Agreed Bro Mabel.
I’m not a trader. I’m long term investor who buy 1-2 share annually, earn 100% then sold.
Most of the time I buy company with short term problem or do major Capex.
But around 2017 I couldn’t find cheap company to invest. Then I start speculating. At 1st quite easy to earn. And I didt aware that I’m speculating. I average down to the share i speculating… I tot another 100% I can have million before age 30.
So end up lost wealth in 2018. And I lose my confidence too.
But that is a great lesson. I review and adjust my risk management. Then my wealth came back again.
What you said, I can see from most of my friend behaviour.
Due to “ scare” ,most people will buy sell buy sell because they think that is the faster and safety way to earn money.
What they didn’t aware is, the more you buy sell, the more short term decisions you have to make in a short period of time. End up, lose money and processing fees.
My remisor’s friend who work in this line more than 10 years told me, people who end up lose money are people who always sell the share they earn a bit , then change new share.
if paper lost, hold the share. End up earn little only.
Stock market is very random. Especially in short term.
Most of the investor use technical , fundamental to buy sell share. Actually they use these tools to guess the short term future only.
The more short term you buy sell, the more lousy decision you make.
Study deep, accumulating when people don’t want , hold for long term, then you can earn big. (long term is a mind set, not time frame)
Technical analysis most of the time i see the comment is:
If break XX price then can buy, if drop the support then need to run.
Actually simple said: if up then up, if down then down.
My mom also can make this comment. Guessing up and down, is 50:50.
Off course sure got right or wrong. When right we tot our tooth is power without aware that it is luck too.
Fundamental analysis: if the business earn more money, then share price up. Also is a guess. Most of my ffiend use fundamental, but they also cant accumulate wealth.
Simple because when share price up a bit, they took profit and change to another share.
At the end, most of the tools we use, end up the decision almost same.
Use them predict they short term , got profit sell, then change new share.
repeat this then can earn money very fast.
No matter what tool you use, the quality investment decisions take time.
Use more time to do homework, when chance come, put more capital, build a pro-folio, don’t simple take profit due to the share price up. Because you kill the goose that lays the golden eggs too early…
2013 I invested 30K in Vitrox, I took 100% profit in 1 year. I tot I’m smart. End up I lose million. This is a good lesson for me.
*Review your buy sell record.
Around 8-9 friend who seek for my help regarding their poor investment result.
I asked them review pass year result. Although each share is different, but They are suprice to see the same pattern keep repeat. If you not happy with the result, is time to change your investment pattern. Find the investment way that suit you with good long term result.

The key positive takeaway from the results is the group’s improvement in operating profit, rising from RM94.3m in FY20 to RM299.7m in FY21.
• The MACD indicator is also showing weaker downward momentum, thus laying the ground for an ensuing rally.
• The stochastic indicator is turning bullish too, suggesting that the stock could continue trending upwards.
• With the aforementioned positive technical signals, an anticipated upward movement in the share price could challenge our resistance levels of RM0.24 (R1; 14% upside potential) and RM0.28 (R2; 33% upside potential).

The reduction of capital is done by companies for numerous reasons, including increasing shareholder value and producing a more efficient capital structure.
Understanding Capital Reduction
After a capital reduction, the number of shares in the company will decrease by the reduction amount. While the company's market capitalization will not change as a result of such a move, the float, or number of shares outstanding and available to trade, will be reduced.
The act of capital reduction may also be enacted in response to a decline in a company's operating profits or a revenue loss that cannot be recovered from a company's expected future earnings. In some capital reductions, shareholders will receive a cash payment for shares canceled, but in most other situations, there is minimal impact on shareholders.
A company is required to reduce its share capital using a set of specific steps. First, a notice must be sent out to creditors of the resolution of the capital reduction. Second, the company has to then submit an application for entry of the reduction of share capital no earlier than three months after publication of the initial notice. Share capital reduction is then expected to be paid to shareholders no earlier than three months after the entry of reduction in the commercial register.
Example of Capital Reduction
Many companies decide to reduce capital through repurchase agreements (buybacks). For example, Sirius XM Radio, an American broadcasting company that provides ad-free satellite radio services, announced on January 29, 2019 that its Board of Directors had approved an additional $2 billion common stock repurchase. The additional $2 billion repurchase in 2019 will bring the company's buyback authorizations to $14 billion in total since 2013. Sirius XM will fund the repurchase through cash on hand, future cash flow from operations, and future borrowings."

KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 8): Parkson Holdings Bhd has proposed to cancel RM2 billion of its issued share capital in a move to reduce the group's accumulated losses.
According to a bourse filing on Monday, the group is in the red as accumulated losses amounted to RM932.47 million as at June 30, 2021.
The group expects to return to the black with retained earnings of RM1.05 billion after the capital reduction exercise.
After the exercise is completed, its issued share capital will be reduced to RM2.15 billion from RM4.15 billion.
Parkson said that the exercise will allow the company and group to rationalise their financial positions by reducing their accumulated losses through the reduction of its share capital which is lost or unrepresented by available assets of the group while reflecting a more accurate picture of the value of its underlying assets and financial position.
The reduction of accumulated losses from the exercise is expected to enhance the credibility of the company with the bankers, customers, suppliers, investors and other stakeholders according to the retail group.
The proposal, subject to shareholders' approval, is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2022.
Parkson's share price was flat at 22 sen on Monday, valuing the group at RM240.66 million.
