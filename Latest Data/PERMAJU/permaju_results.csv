KUALA LUMPUR: The second extension of the movement control order to contain the Covid-19 outbreak — now totalling six weeks until April 28 — means that economic activities will remain subdued for at least another 14 days.
The pandemic, which has infected nearly two million and killed over 100,000 worldwide, presents the worst start possible for the recession expected ahead. As the infection curve has yet to near its peak, it is anyone’s guess on the depth of the economic downturn.
Against this backdrop, survival is the prominent concern now. Investors’ attention is drawn to companies’ balance sheets instead of growth prospects, which is widely expected to be minimal in the best-case scenario, as business volume dwindles and operating cash flow shrink.
Asia Analytica data shows that of some 880 listed companies (after excluding the 40 banks, insurers and investment trusts), 597 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia have cash that is less than their short-term liabilities.
Companies in many different sectors are underlined here, from furniture companies to retailers, automotive-related firms, and a wide range of manufacturers and trading companies.
Meanwhile, 223 listed companies have an interest cover ratio of below one times, meaning their earnings before interests and tax cannot cover interest expenses for a full year. The market capitalisation of most of these companies are below RM2 billion.
Some 321 companies were already in the red last year. Of the 599 profitable ones, around 45.6% of them saw profit decline in the period. Again, most on the list are small-cap firms, according to Asia Analytica data.
It is also worth noting that the economic downturn would be a tough test on companies’ sales quality. Companies with a high portion of credit sale with mounting receivables could be at risk amid the potential cash trap.
A random check shows that 75 listed companies or 8.2% have net gearing of over 100%. Sectors with the most companies in this category are logistics, construction, oil and gas, building materials and property development.
Others with net gearing of above 80% include power companies, telecommunications companies and building materials companies. Power producers’ liabilities are usually backed up by the steady cash flow from power purchase agreements.
On the flip side, notable sectors with low net gearing average include Internet and gas utility companies, and technology solution providers.
Of 79 generic companies with market capitalisation of above RM2 billion (ex-banks, real-estate investment trusts and insurers) only 22 have a cash ratio of above one times and net gearing of below 50%, led by Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd, Petronas Gas Bhd and IOI Corp Bhd.
As reflected by the price-to-book valuations, preference is given for companies with high cash, low debt, steady recurring income and high-quality clients, such as tech companies, and broadband providers.
There are also lesser-known small-cap companies that are cash-rich with sturdy past operations.
As a fund manager pointed out that a downturn is a brewing pot for merger and acquisition activities, as smaller, cash-rich companies with good assets or business prospects usually become undervalued after the market selldown.
The first quarter’s (1Q20) financial result will show how much cash was exhausted amid the two-week shutdown in the second half of March, while prospects of the entire half of 2Q20 being under movement restriction are still visible."

The product is one of the very few solutions in the world that have successfully been tested to work against the Covid-19 virus, Permaju said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia today.
The group said its wholly-owned subsidiary Team Japs Sdn Bhd has entered into a collaboration agreement with Pentaweft Biotech Ltd to study the feasibility of making and distributing the “Penaclo solution” in Southeast Asian countries.
The countries are Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines.
The first batch of the Penaclo solution will be aimed at the personal precautionary market. The parties will then develop other Penaclo solutions aimed at sanitising high-risk areas such as hospitals, offices, restaurants, schools and public transport."

There were no comparative numbers from the previous year, due to a change in its financial year end from Dec 31 to June 30.
For the nine-month period ended March 31, the group posted a net loss of RM3.58 million on revenue of RM51.69 million. Going forward, Permaju said its automotive division may continue to face weak sales amid the Covid-19 crisis. It also expects the property sector to remain challenging due to ""weak demand and oversupply market"". Permaju has planned a rights issue for additional working capital, which it believes will be positive for the group's operations, moving forward. The Edge Fri, Jun 19, 2020"

I think he uses macd, rsi, volume, sma, golden cross and etc to predict potential price movement. with permaju diving so sharply, it will rebound sharply too, question is how high, nobody knows. too risky.
my advice is, if want to trade, trade big companies. less profit but less risk too."

Permaju Industries Bhd last week incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Permaju Glove Sdn Bhd (PGSB) to venture into glove manufacturing and is banking on the global shortage of gloves to make the jump in the business.
In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, Permaju said the intended principal activity of PGSB is to manufacture, distribute, buy, sell and generally deal in rubber goods for industrial and commercial purposes.
Permaju said the rationale of the incorporation of PGSB is to facilitate the expansion of the business activities of the group and its subsidiaries,"" it said.
Permaju is involved in the distribution of Volkswagen and Ford franchise.
It is also involved in property development and owns big parcels of land in Sabah and Seremban, Negeri Sembilan.
The group owns 121.4 hectares of land in Seremban that is suitable for housing projects or industrial activities.
New Straits Times reported that Permaju may set up a production facility in Seremban, investing between RM150 million and RM200 million.
The group may start construction this year, subject to approvals from the relevant authorities.
Permaju intends to manufacture gloves among other rubber-related products for the export market and also to sell in Malaysia.
The biggest glove makers in Malaysia are Top Glove Glove Corp Bhd, Supermax Corp Bhd, Hartalega Holdings Bhd, and Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd and they have seen a surge in demand since the emergence last December of the deadly novel coronavirus or Covid-19 in China.
More than seven million people have been infected and the virus has now claimed over 400,000 lives worldwide.
Last year, global demand for gloves was 290 billion pieces, of which 187 billion were supplied by Malaysia. The current global demand for gloves is more than 300 billion pieces, owing to the pandemic."

MInda is the first choice among this counters because it directly benefit from the university reopen later.

So on Monday, the price might just goes back to above 30.0 sen and you guys get 5 free PR for every share you hold before ex. My optimistic mind tell me that IF the mother trades above 30.0 sen, then when PR listed on 15/07, theoretically it worth 2 sen, but IF the market managed to push the mother share up to 35.0 sen (recent high) by month end, then PR worth 4.0 sen. Wow..it is 55 sen cum ex price. Cheers. ."

Subscribe at 0.05 per piece = 10 x 0.05 = 0.5
Total money paid to get 10 ICP = 0.55
To convert to 2 mother shares = 0.55 ÷ 2 = 0.275 per mother share.
Which is about at the current price of the mother shares.
But you get an extra Warrant.
If the ICP and warrant is listed at 0.05 each and you sell all of them, you'll get 0.05 x10 + 0.05 x 1 = 0.55
Nett profit = 0.55 - 0.55 = 0.0
So to be in the money, the ICP and warrant must be above 0.05 each during listing.
Is it possible?"

If you have 50 lots ICPS from your entitlement and you subscribe all by paying RM2, 500, you get 5 lots of free warrants in return. Your investment will be safe even if the mother share price drops to 0.25. What puzzled me is why the current holders of preference share rights (pr) sold them at 0.005 n queuing to sell at 0.01 when the mother share is at between 0.305 n 0.325? Does this mean the mother share price will drop lower than 0.25 by the time you convert your ICPS into mother share n when this mother share is deposited into your account?

Basically, the ICPS to be capped at its subscription price of 5 sen on listing day, meaning the subscriber to lose 1/2 sen per ICPS or 5 sen for 10 ICPS. But that can be covered up if the free warrant is traded at 5 sen on listing day. If an ICPS is capped at 5 sen, the mother share should at 25 sen to break even. (5 sen lost due to the subscription is covered by the warrant if it is traded at 5 sen). If the mother share is at higher than 25 sen, then the ICPS is in the money to do the conversion. If the ICPS is traded higher than 5 sen, then it is in the money too. Every 1 sen traded higher than 5 sen is a gain is 10 sen. If one has subscribed 100,000 ICPS, then the gain is RM1,000. If the ICPS is to be traded at 7 sen on listing day (which is quite possible) the gain from 100,000 ICPS = RM2,000.
Perhaps can make a study and comparison to Age's-Pa and ARBB-Pa, where subscribers, I believe have made quite a handsome money."

Share price can go up as well as come down. The news of Permaju involvement in glove business with Anzo isn't great at all for me because for me Anzo is not trustworthy and their recent announcement of Purchase Agreement of a glove manufacturing factory (that had ceased production n closed down more than 2 years ago) is very suspicious in nature. One can see from the lack of informations on how Anzo has replied to the 2 queries by SC. The same goes for Anzo's deal in the scrap copper business. A lot of naive n stupid investors (oppsss i should not address them as investors as these ppl are just traders/speculators) got themselves burnt n losing money badly by jumping n buying into a few companies that made announcements to be involved in gloves business.

Quantity of PR share : 100,000
Cost of PR share (RM0.005/share x 100,000) : RM500.00
Subscribe Cost : RM0.05/Share
Total Subscribe Cost : RM5,000
PR + Subscribe Cost + Stamp Duty : RM5,510.00
Convert to Mother : 5:1
Quantity of Mother share : 20,000
Current mother price: RM0.330/share)
Total Mother Price : RM6,600
Gain : RM6,600 - RM5,510 = RM1,090
Free Warrant 10:1
Quantity of warrant : 10,000
Exercise Price : RM0.25 x 10,000 : RM2,500
Current mother price: RM0.330/share) x 10,000 = RM3,300
Gain : RM3,300 - RM2,500 = RM800
Therefore 100,000 PR can have gain of RM1,890 if mother is RM0.330

Mah Sing Group Bhd is the biggest beneficiary of the reintroduction of the HOC as most of its projects are eligible and are in strategic locations. In 2019,60% its assets were sold under the HOC
PETALING JAYA: Property developers are seeing strong bookings, particularly in June, since the reintroduction of the Home Ownership Campaign (HOC).
However, UOB Kay Hian said the conversion from bookings into sales remains a concern, as evidenced by the lower mortgage loan approval rate by the central bank.
“Mah Sing Group Bhd is the biggest beneficiary of the reintroduction of the HOC as most of its projects are eligible and are in strategic locations. In 2019,60% its assets were sold under the HOC.”
Even though most property companies experienced a surge in the number of property bookings during the second quarter of this year, UOB Kay Hian said the conversion of bookings into actual sales will be less encouraging, given stringent financing by banks.
“Traditionally, companies under our coverage report a conversion rate of between 50% and 70%.
“But due to the pandemic, the conversion rate has been lowered to below 50% on average.
“According to Bank Negara, mortgage applications in June increased significantly to RM25.4bil, which mirrored the amount in May 2019, a month after the first HOC was officially launched last year.
￼Prospective buyers looking at a model of a Mah Sing project
“Furthermore, apart from the HOC, the strong loan applications were also attributable to the back-loading effect due to the movement control order.”
The government reintroduced the HOC in June under the Short-Term Economic Recovery Plan (Penjana).
Under the campaign, stamp duty exemption will be provided on the transfer of property and loan agreement for the purchase of home priced between RM300,000 and RM2.5mil. Meanwhile, the exemption on the instrument of transfer is limited to the first RM1mil of the home price, while full stamp duty exemption is given on loan agreement effective for sales and purchase agreements signed between June 1 to May 31,2021.
In addition, the government has announced real property gains tax exemption for Malaysians for the disposal of up to three properties between June 1,2020 and Dec 31,2021.
The HOC was kicked off in January last year to address the overhang problem in the country.
The campaign, which was initially intended for six months, was extended for a year.
The HOC proved successful, having generated total sales of RM23.2bil in 2019, surpassing the government’s initial target of RM17bil.
Citing Bank Negara statistics, UOB Kay Hian said mortgage loan approval rates declined to a historic low of 24.5% as at June 2020.
“In absolute terms, out of RM25.4bil of mortgage loans applied in June, only RM6.3bil were approved. This was largely due to the fact that banks are becoming more stringent in dishing out mortgage loans, particularly to applicants that are employed in sectors affected by Covid-19, such as hospitality, aviation and tourism.
“For perspective, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, mortgage loan approval rates were at 43.3% and 43.1% respectively for 2018 and 2019.”
Additionally, the research house said more companies are diversifying into healthcare.
“In light of the pandemic, there are a handful of local property developers who have recently ventured into the healthcare business.
“We are concerned about this development, especially for property developers with no expertise in either manufacturing or the healthcare segment.
“Our concern is on the grounds of potential oversupply of healthcare-related products, particularly with the massive production in China where the barriers to entry are relatively lower.”"

KUALA LUMPUR (June 5): After announcing plans to venture into bottling and distributing of sanitiser products, as well as selling air purification products amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Permaju Industries Bhd is now eyeing the rubber gloves business.
Permaju, which is mainly involved in distribution of vehicles, property development and plantation, said in a filing today that it has incorporated a company named Permaju Glove Sdn Bhd (PGSB).
“The intended principal activity of PGSB is to manufacture, distribute, buy, sell and generally deal in rubber goods for industrial and commercial purposes and other related goods, wares and merchandise of every nature and description,” it said.
On April 28, Permaju inked a memorandum of understanding with a local firm to sell the firm’s air purification products to its customers in the automotive sector, citing exponential demand growth for the product.
Prior to that on April 7, the group said it is looking into bottling and distributing Penaclo, a Hong Kong firm’s sanitiser product, for the Southeast Asian market.
Shares of Permaju Industries Bhd slid half a sen or 0.75% to 66 sen today, valuing the group at RM129.32 million. Year-to-date, the counter has retreated 19.02%.

Permaju Industries enters deal to make HK firm’s sanitiser for SEA market
Justin Lim

April 06, 2020 20:44 pm +08
KUALA LUMPUR (April 6): Permaju Industries Bhd is looking into bottling and distributing a Hong Kong firm’s sanitiser product for the Southeast Asian market.
The product is one of the very few solutions in the world that have successfully been tested to work against the Covid-19 virus, Permaju said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia today.
The group said its wholly-owned subsidiary Team Japs Sdn Bhd has entered into a collaboration agreement with Pentaweft Biotech Ltd to study the feasibility of making and distributing the “Penaclo solution” in Southeast Asian countries.
The countries are Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines.
The first batch of the Penaclo solution will be aimed at the personal precautionary market. The parties will then develop other Penaclo solutions aimed at sanitising high-risk areas such as hospitals, offices, restaurants, schools and public transport.
“With over one million people now infected with the global pandemic, and the rest of the world panicking, the quick roll-out of this solution is key to alleviating and containing the further spread of the virus,” Permaju said in a separate statement.
Pentaweft Biotech is the sales and manufacturing arm of the Pentaweft group of companies that is engaged in the biotechnology industry and focuses on the development and commercialisation of various medical products and medicines.
Pentaweft said the Penaclo solution is in the process of patenting in China and other countries. It claimed that the solution has been tested by a leading key respiratory disease research institute in China and found to be effective in eradicating over 99.95% of the Covid-19 virus within the first 30 seconds of application.
It added that the Penaclo solution is shown to have a low toxicity rate and is safe for use on Vero E6 cells.
""We are planning to launch a series of Penaclo sanitiser products for personal and institutional applications,"" Pentaweft said.
Permaju Industries’ share price closed three sen or 3.64% lower at 79.5 sen, valuing the group at RM148.87 million."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001302.jsp?ftp=70","Aug 25, 2020 5:35 PM","Victor Yong","Further news on such biz will boost the share price, i believe :)
Permaju said that AFLM’s products are based on technology developed by the North America Space Agency (NASA), which was used to aid in keeping astronauts healthy on space missions.
The MoU is intended for both parties to work towards the appointment of Cergaz Autohaus as a non-exclusive sub-distributor to sell and market AFLM’s products to its customers in the automotive sector, Permaju said.
Cergaz Autohaus is currently an authorised dealer for Volkswagen cars.
“The entire world is fighting with the Covid-19 pandemic and the demand of Air For Life equipment is increasing exponentially.
“The main objective of signing this MoU is to introduce Air For Life products that help to make our environment safer after the Covid-19 pandemic and increased revenue in our group’s automotive division and corporate customers,” said Permaju executive director Yvonne Chai.
The MoU will be valid for a period of three months, Permaju said.
Permaju’s share price fell four sen or 5.8% to 65 sen, giving the group a market capitalisation of RM127.36 million."

Permaju Industries Bhd (Permaju) and Anzo Holdings Bhd (Anzo) will jointly expand a glove manufacturing plant in Manjung Perak, which could cost about RM25 million.
The amount is also to refurbish the factory’s existing 9 production lines and to add 4 or 6 new lines to meet the increasing orders coming in from the United States and Europe.
People who are aware about this said that, Permaju and its consultants have done a feasibility study on the Manjung factory to determine the fastest way to get the factory to produce over 3 billion pieces of medical or nitrile gloves per annum.
Anzo is paying RM55 million to acquire a company called Wintrade World Sdn Bhd which owns the land, factory, machinery and equipment.
The assets are ready to be mobilised and commissioned to produce 1.2 billion pieces of medical and nitrile gloves a year but Anzo needs more than 3 billion pieces a year to meet the existing orders from the United States and Europe worth about US$200 million.
Looks like Permaju and Anzo have to speed up refurbishing and expanding the factory as the outbreak of the disease is getting worse and there is currently a shortage in the supply of medical or nitrile gloves worldwide.
It seems to me Anzo is moving ahead with its expansion, both in copper and glove manufacturing despite CSTME Resource Sdn Bhd’s exit from the company on July 8
CSTME emerged as Anzo’s largest shareholder on June 23 with an indirect 11.62% stake. The stock closed 13 sen on the day this was announced to Bursa Malaysia.
On July 8, CSTME disposed of its shares in Anzo via the open market. CSTME sold a total of about 115 million shares at 23 sen worth about RM25 million. It sold the shares at 81 per cent higher than its buying price.
Even though CSTME sold its shares in Anzo, the stock traded actively. It closed 20 sen on July 10 and the average daily volume exceeded more than 100 million for 8 days.
Despite CSTME’s exit from Anzo, their copper deal is still moving ahead and it is business as usual for both the companies.
Last month Anzo secured a RM1.3 billion contract to supply copper scrap over 40 months to a steelmaker in South Korea effective from July 1.
Anzo and its subsidiaries entered into a supply agreement with CSTME, which holds an AP licence to export the goods. CSTME agreed to buy birch/cliff copper scrap or berry/candy copper scrap from Anzo and export the products to the steelmaker in South Korea.
Anzo is expected to supply 60,000 tonnes of copper scrap to CSTME at RM23,000 per tonne over 40 months. CSTME has been supplying the copper to South Korea effective July 1. As of July 11, it has supplied up to 600 tonnes worth almost RM14 million.
With this copper deal and the orders it is getting for medical gloves, Anzo is set to post more than RM200 million in net profit in its next financial year ending July 31, 2021 and onward.
This is quite possible given the high trading price for gloves, which is at US$75 per box of 1,000 pieces. It was also reported that copper prices will stabilize in the coming quarters despite a recent surge in the red metal’s value."

Permaju Bags RM1.2bil Contract For Selangor Housing Project
Pavither • July 17, 2020
￼
Permaju Industries Bhd is said to have clinched a RM1.2 billion construction contract for the development of over 7,000 apartment units in Selangor.
Citing construction industry sources, the New Straits Times (NST) reported that the contract was awarded by a reputable property developer who owns a large tract of land within the Seri Kembangan/Serdang area, around 15km of Cyberjaya and south of Kuala Lumpur city centre.
The highest building within the development will have more than 50 floors, potentially making it the tallest building in the Seri Kembangan/Serdang area.

To be built in the next six to seven years, the project is believed to have a gross development value of around RM2.4 billion, reported NST.
“The developer decided to kick-start construction after the Penjana plan was announced as they are now more confident in the market recovering. They received approval to develop the project last year but had put it on hold and feel now is a good time to re-start,” NST quoted the source as saying.
In June, Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin unveiled the RM35 billion National Economic Recovery Plan (Penjana) in a bid to revive the economy.
To encourage growth within the property sector, the Home Ownership Campaign (HOC) was reintroduced, in which stamp duty exemptions were offered on the instrument of transfer as well as loan agreement for the purchase of homes priced from RM300,000 to RM2.5 million.
Limited to the first RM1 million of the property’s purchase price, the exemption is applicable between 1 June 2020 and 31 May 2021.
The government also offered an exemption on real property gains tax (RPGT) to Malaysians for the disposal of up to three properties from 1 June 2020 to 31 December 2021.
Permaju, via its subsidiary companies, is involved in timber plantation, trading of motor vehicles, construction, and property development.
The company, through Hardie Development Sdn Bhd, developed a mixed housing estate in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah – known as Alam Puteri."

For eg.: scenario
A.) Buy PA @ 7c 100Lot + RM 20k top up = RM 27,000 (Cost) Based on Mother price (0.42), Profit = (100,000 units x 0.42) - 27,000 => RM 15,000.00
B.) If buy RM 27,000 worth of PA @ 7c ( 385,714 Lot PA => 77,142 units mother ) Based on Mother price (0.42), Profit = (77142units x 0.42) - 27,000 => RM 5,399.64

Section 175 of the CMSA - False Trading/Market Rigging
This involves matched transactions where the buyer and seller are the same i.e. either involving the same Central Depository System (CDS) account or ""passing around"" a specific group of CDS accounts. Transactions result in no change in beneficial ownership (NCBO).
Note: Essentially, the law provides that a person shall not create, or cause to be created, or do anything that is calculated to create, a false or misleading appearance of active trading in any securities on a stock market in Malaysia or a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for, or the price of, any such securities.
Section 176 of CMSA - Stock Market Manipulation
Stock market manipulation is the act of transacting in the securities of a company that will have or is likely to have the effect of raising or lowering or maintaining the price of the company's securities on a stock market, with the intention of inducing other persons to purchase or subscribe for the company's securities. Such acts are illegal under the CMSA.
Note: Essentially, the law provides that a person shall not effect, take part in, be concerned in or carry out, either directly or indirectly, any number of transactions in securities of a corporation, being transactions that have, or are likely to have, the effect of raising, lowering or fixing the price of securities of the corporation on a stock market in Malaysia, for the purpose or purposes which may include the purpose of inducing other persons, to purchase or dispose of the securities of the corporation or of a related corporation."

You can choose to ignore me, be a dickhead everywhere you go and be nasty to ppl whom you don’t even know and has no business with, ppl like me will just walk away, the only ppl who suffer would be those stuck with you (family). Ultimately, you are the bearer of pain, creating a vicious cycle.
Or, you can take a moment to try something you have never done before - use your brain and feel your heart to understand what went wrong in your life that cause so much pain and hatred that you would so something so brainless as barking at random innocent ppl. Then do something about it. Maybe you got raped by 10 men while you were a kid, or your wife cheated on you with a dog... whatever it is, you won’t get closure by barking at random ppl. Try to fix it inside you instead of taking it out on others.
I wish one day you would recover from your mental illness.

Else nowadays I prefer to hold on to certain stock which I knew beaten down badly then I quietly buy..lorries. I think you saw me in some counters also haha those are waiting for big profits...Short term if the criteria don't match I no masuk, because short term trade the chances of losing without certain criterias present is no difference than go casino.

We wish to provide the overview and outlook of the luxury car rental market in Malaysia as follows:-
The luxury car rental market in Malaysia is where luxury car rental service operators operate in to offer long-term or short-term luxury car rental services for business or leisure purposes. Luxury car rental service operators are typically scattered across the country, with offices and booths located at strategic locations such as airports and hotels to facilitate pick-up and return of vehicles at users’ preferred locations.
Luxury cars are vehicles with high-end features such as sleek outlook, plush interior and more powerful engine performance. These luxury cars are available in various forms such as sedan, sport utility vehicle (“SUV”) and multipurpose vehicle (“MPV”).
Luxury cars are often rented for social events such as weddings and formal events, discreet airport pickups, drop-offs and general transfers for very important persons (“VIPs”) and celebrities for business or leisure purposes, and long-term corporate hires. With the emergence of the luxury car rental market, users are able to experience luxury cars without owning the vehicle."

These days, luxury car renting is done mainly through service operators’ websites and/or mobile applications, which enables users to book vehicles online conveniently. Rates are disclosed along with options from the fleet of luxury cars and other value-added services offered by operators, providing users a thorough view of the vehicle and services to be obtained before proceeding to book and pay. The value-added services which may be provided by the luxury car rental service operators include chauffeur, concierge and security services.
The luxury car rental market in Malaysia where luxury car rental service operators which specialises in providing rental services of high-end luxury car makes such as Bentley, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Range Rover and Rolls Royce, serves a niche market as the rental rates of these high-end luxury car makes generally are significantly higher than rental rates of standard cars. The barriers to entry of the luxury car rental market in Malaysia is high as new entrants have to incur high initial capital investment on a fleet of luxury cars and to develop a booking platform. To sustain and expand the luxury car rental business and to remain competitive in the market over the long term, the luxury car rental service operators will be required to expand the fleet of high performing luxury cars, offer competitive rates, have wide geographical coverage, good customer service and value-added services, employ effective marketing strategies and convenient booking platforms, which will incur substantial capital investments and operational costs.
The outbreak of the COVID-19 since early 2020 has impacted many countries around the world. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organisation (“WHO”) declared a public health emergency of international concern on COVID-19. Later, on 11 March 2020, the WHO made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterised as a pandemic due to the alarming levels of spread and severity and levels of inaction.
Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the Government of Malaysia imposed a MCO throughout Malaysia from 18 March 2020 to 3 May 2020, conditional MCO from 4 May 2020 to 9 June 2020 and recovery MCO from 10 June 2020 to 31 December 2020, and re-imposition of conditional MCO in states and federal territories (e.g. Sabah, Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya and Labuan) that recorded alarming levels of COVID-19 infection cases in October 2020 to restrict the movement of people. Further, the Government also imposed travel bans; limit event participants; and imposed physical distancing rule to curb the spread of the virus. As a result, business and leisure travels, as well as weddings, concerts and business summits which were expected to draw large crowd were cancelled, postponed or simplified. This has significantly reduced the demand for luxury car rental services and has adversely impacted the luxury car rental market.
Nevertheless, while the luxury car rental market in Malaysia is expected to experience a slowdown in 2020 mainly due to dampened economic outlook from the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, Smith Zander International Sdn Bhd (“SMITH ZANDER”) anticipates that in the longer term, after the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic ends and after the recovery of the economic conditions, the luxury car rental market is expected to be supported by the rise of more affluent population and high income households, growth of the meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (“MICE”) industry as well as increasing awareness of the sharing economy.
Key Market Drivers
 Rise of more affluent population and high income households drive the demand for high-end lifestyles
Malaysia is an upper-middle income economy with aspirations to achieve high income status by 2030. GDP per capita increased by 12.47% from approximately RM38,860.70 in 2016 to RM43,707.53 in 2019. Notably, 1.46 million households were recorded within the top 20 (“T20”) household group in 2019, an increase of 5.04% from 1.39 million households in 2016. This indicates a rise of more affluent population and high income households with greater spending power, leading to demand for high-end lifestyles involving luxury spending such as renting of luxury cars for various purposes such as events, weddings or long distance drives.

Nevertheless, moving forward, in view"

On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organisation (“WHO”) declared a public health emergency of international concern on COVID-19. Later, on 11 March 2020, the WHO made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterised as a pandemic due to the alarming levels of spread and severity and levels of inaction.

Due to these reasons, the demand for luxury car rental services may have significantly reduced, adversely impacting the financial performance of market players during the period of the COVID- 19 outbreak.
 Exposure to high car maintenance and upkeep cost as well as inadequate insurance coverage
Luxury car rental service providers are required to ensure their fleet of luxury cars are in pristine condition before handling over to users. Failure to do so may cause luxury car rental service providers to lose their competitive edge to other competitors. As such, luxury car rental service providers are subject to high costs to maintain and upkeep the luxury cars.
Further, luxury car rental service providers are subject to the risk of inadequate insurance coverage. In the event that the vehicles are involved in car accidents or damaged in natural disasters in excess of insurance coverage, luxury car rental service providers are required to incur significant costs in repair work. In such circumstances, their financial performance may be materially and adversely affected.

Permaju to develop high-rise housing project worth RM2.4 billion
Permaju Industries Bhd will undertake the development of a high-rise housing project in Seri Kembangan/Serdang for a reputable developer. File photo of Alam Puteri.
Permaju Industries Bhd is believed to have won a construction contract worth about RM1.2 billion to undertake a massive property development project in Selangor.
Sources in the construction industry said that the contract was awarded by a reputable developer who owns a big plot of land in the Seri Kembangan/Serdang area, located to the south of Kuala Lumpur city centre and about 15km from Cyberjaya.
It is understood, the contract is to build more than 7,000 units of apartments over the next six to seven years.
The highest tower in this development will stand at a height of over 50 floors which may make it the tallest structure in the Seri Kembangan/Serdang area.
Permaju officials were not available for comment at Press time.
The project will be a boom for both Permaju and the construction industry.
Activities in the construction sector had slowed down more than a year ago and further dampened by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Last month Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin announced the RM35 billion National Economic Recovery Plan (Penjana) for economic regeneration, which will benefit among others, the construction and property sectors.

To encourage the growth of the property sector, the government reintroduced the Home Ownership Campaign (HOC), which offers stamp duty exemption on the first RM1 million of a property's value on the Memorandum of Transfer for properties priced from RM300,000 to RM2.5 million, and 100 per cent stamp duty exemption for the financing agreement under the Penjana plan.
The exemption is applicable between June 1, 2020, to May 31, 2021, subject to properties that are priced at a 10 per cent discount provided by developers.
The government also announced an exemption on real property gains tax (RPGT) for Malaysians for disposal of up to three properties between June 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021.
""The developer decided to kick-start construction after the Penjana plan was announced as they are now more confident in the market recovering. They received approval to develop the project last year but had put it on hold and feel now is a good time to re-start,"" said a source.
It is firmly believed that the estimated gross development value is in the region of RM2.4 billion.
Permaju will come in as a design and build contractor.
It is unclear if Permaju will also help in selling the apartments.
Permaju, through its subsidiary companies, is involved in the trading of motor vehicles, timber plantation, construction, and property development.
Through Hardie Development Sdn Bhd it had developed a project called Alam Puteri, a mixed housing estate located in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah."

Permaju latest developer to diversify
Permaju Industries Bhd last week incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Permaju Glove Sdn Bhd (PGSB) to venture into glove manufacturing and is banking on the global shortage of gloves to make the jump in the business.
In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, Permaju said the intended principal activity of PGSB is to manufacture, distribute, buy, sell and generally deal in rubber goods for industrial and commercial purposes.
Permaju said the rationale of the incorporation of PGSB is to facilitate the expansion of the business activities of the group and its subsidiaries,"" it said.
Permaju is involved in the distribution of Volkswagen and Ford franchise.
It is also involved in property development and owns big parcels of land in Sabah and Seremban, Negeri Sembilan.
The group owns 121.4 hectares of land in Seremban that is suitable for housing projects or industrial activities.
New Straits Times reported that Permaju may set up a production facility in Seremban, investing between RM150 million and RM200 million.
The group may start construction this year, subject to approvals from the relevant authorities.
Permaju intends to manufacture gloves among other rubber-related products for the export market and also to sell in Malaysia.
The biggest glove makers in Malaysia are Top Glove Glove Corp Bhd, Supermax Corp Bhd, Hartalega Holdings Bhd, and Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd and they have seen a surge in demand since the emergence last December of the deadly novel coronavirus or Covid-19 in China.
More than seven million people have been infected and the virus has now claimed over 400,000 lives worldwide.
Last year, global demand for gloves was 290 billion pieces, of which 187 billion were supplied by Malaysia. The current global demand for gloves is more than 300 billion pieces, owing to the pandemic."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001302.jsp?ftp=80","Nov 10, 2020 1:11 PM","Victor Yong","Steps taken by the Group to improve its financial condition
Historically, the Group was principally involved in the sale and distribution of motor vehicles, specifically the operations of dealerships of the Volkswagen and Ford franchises. This automotive segment of the Group has been incurring consecutive losses since 2007 due to the highly competitive environment in the automotive division. In view of this, in 2010, the Group diversified into property development via its 70% subsidiary, Hardie Development Sdn Bhd.
On 16 April 2018, Mercury Securities had, on behalf of the Board, announced that the Company proposes to undertake, amongst others, the Rights Issue of ICPS with Warrants. The Rights Issue of ICPS with Warrants was completed on 21 August 2020, raising a total of RM46.82 million. The proceeds from the Rights Issue of ICPS with Warrants was intended to be utilised mainly for the following:
(i) to fund the development of the Land including the Mydin Project, which will be leased out to Mydin Mohamed Holdings Bhd (“Mydin”) upon completion for a period of 20 years. The Group expects the rental income to be earned upon the completion of the Mydin Project, as well as the development of the surrounding plots to contribute to the Group’s future earnings and improve its financial performance; and
(ii) to increase its inventory levels of its automobiles and spare parts. This increase in inventories is expected to enable the Group to better meet demand for customers’ orders by reducing the average lead time for delivery of automobiles and services. A reduction in average lead time for both delivery of new vehicles as well as spare parts and services is expected to increase customer satisfaction, which may in turn lead to an increase in sales in the future.
Concurrently with the Rights Issue of ICPS with Warrants, the Company had also undertaken the settlement of an amount of RM22,248,918 owing by the Company to certain creditors via the issuance of ICPS (“Debt Settlement”). The Debt Settlement, which was completed on 21 August 2020, has improved the Group’s financial standing and ability to obtain more favourable financing terms by converting its existing debts into ICPS which are not redeemable for cash and are not entitled to any dividends.
In addition to the above, the Group has been implementing cost-cutting measures such as monitoring office expenditure and staff expenses closely for the automotive division. In addition, the Company is also working towards identifying marketing programs to boost the sale of automobiles and after-sales services.
However, the Group anticipates the economic landscape for the automotive industry to remain challenging due to softer demand as a result of the COVID- 19 pandemic as well as stiff competition from other automotive brands. As such, moving forward, the Group will be focusing on the development of the Land as well as delivery of the Mydin Project to generate revenues and profits for the Group moving forward.
Upon completion of the Mydin Project, the Group will earn rental income via the lease of the hypermarket to Mydin. In addition, the operations of a hypermarket on the Land is also expected to improve the demand for the Group’s other property development projects in the vicinity.
14
In addition, the Group has identified the luxury car rental business as a potential new source of revenue for the Group. This represents an expansion from the Group’s existing automotive business which entails the sale and distribution of motor vehicles. The Group intends to leverage on its existing resources and expertise in the automotive business to ensure the success of the new luxury car rental business.
Premised on the above as well as the overview and outlook of the automotive industry, the car rental industry and the property market in Malaysia, the Group is cautiously optimistic of its future prospects moving forward despite a challenging economic outlook ahead as the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic gradually becomes observable."

Possible for further rebound. PERMAJU formed a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern yesterday, of which signifies a potential halt in its prior downtrend. Slightly improved RSI and MACD indicators currently signal reasonable entry level, with anticipation of continuous improvement in both momentum and trend in the near term. Should resistance level of RM0.205 be broken with renewed buying interest, it may continue to lift price higher to subsequent resistance level of RM0.225.
However, failure to hold on to support level of RM0.180 may indicate weakness in the share price and hence, a cut-loss signal.

many businesses across the globe. The COVID-19
pandemic which begun in December 2019 has brought
unprecedented difficulties to the global economy, the
impact of which is expected to last for many months
to come, as our country continues to battle its spread
through these uncertain times. In its wake, new measures
and innovations are brought to the forefront while
businesses strive to support their operations and their
employees.
The Group’s business in the marketing and distribution of
automotive vehicles has also been greatly impacted by
this instability but we believe that the economic stimulus
packages announced by the Government of Malaysia will
support the gradual recovery of economic activities and
in turn help the automotive industry return to pre-COVID
performance.
The Group had completed the disposal of its subsidiaries
involved in its timber business, which were loss-making,
on 15 June 2020. On 21 August 2020, the Group
completed a Rights Issue Irredeemable Convertible
Preference Shares (""ICPS"") with Warrants, of which part
of its proceeds were allocated to repay its overdraft
facility. As at 5 October 2020, we have fully repaid this
overdraft facility. We hope that this will place us in a
stronger financial footing for the coming financial years.
Besides recovery actions, the Group has turned to new
opportunities which will help us achieve continued growth
despite the setbacks brought on by the pandemic.
Approximately RM43.5 million of the Rights Issue ICPS
with Warrants, which was completed on 21 August 2020,
was earmarked for the development of a 4-storey Mydin
hypermarket located within our Princess Heights project,
and to facilitate the expansion of our automotive segment.
Thus far, we have utilised almost 30.0% of these allocated
proceeds from the Rights Issue ICPS with Warrants.
Further, the Group is also expected to benefit from its
recent foray into renewable energy via our joint venture
agreement with VSolar Group Berhad (""Vsolar""). Permaju
and Vsolar will jointly submit a bid to build and operate a
large-scale solar power plant in Seremban with an output
capacity of 50MW on land owned by our subsidiary,
Genbayu Gemilang Sdn Bhd. Investing in solar energy
is not only be an additional revenue stream to the
Group but will be sustainable for our operations and the
environment. Due to technological advancements, the
For the financial year ended June 2020 the Group reported an annual revenue of RM57.58 million
which is a 49.7% decrease compared to RM114.38 million in the previous year. This decrease
in revenue has mainly been caused by lower vehicle sales volume arising from the closure
of businesses due to the Movement Control Order imposed by the Malaysian Government in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as decreased demand for automobiles due to
consumer uncertainty.
capital costs for solar energy has significantly decreased
over the past few years and harnessing the power of
the sun in our geographically blessed nation will result in
fruitful productivity.
The Group’s commitment to sustainability is not only
evidenced from our investment into clean energy but also
in our daily business operations. We maintain our 3 tenets
of sustainability – Environment, Economics, Social – and
continue efforts in both reducing the negative impact that
our businesses have on the environment and increasing
the positive impact we have on society at large. We
understand the value that sustainability matters bring to
the long-term viability of the business and strive to balance
commercial success with corporate responsibility.
Finally, on behalf of the Board, I would like to welcome
Mr. Tang Boon Koon on his appointment as Executive
Director on 5 June 2020 and we certainly look forward
to his support and contribution to the Group. I would also
like to thank Mr. Teh Foo Hock, who has resigned as an
Executive Director on 6 October 2020, for his valuable
contributions to the Group.
Further, I would like to express gratitude for the continued
hard work and commitment given by our management
team and our employees, especially during these trying
times. I also wish to thank our customers, shareholders
and partners for their support and faith in the business.
Through perseverance and dedication of everyone in the
Group, I believe we will achieve greater progress and
milestones in the years to come.

Maybank IB Retail Research
Permaju Industries acquired 100m ordinary shares of Meridian Bhd (MEDA MK, Not Rated), representing 16.97% of issued shares in Meridian, for MYR26m cash or MYR0.26/sh. The acquisition will be funded entirely via internally generated funds. Pursuant to the acquisition, Meridian is now an associate company of Permaju.
At MYR0.26/sh, Permaja is effectively valuing Meridian at a P/B of 1.2x. The acquisition would allow Permaju to expand its property ventures into the West Malaysian market. At present, Permaju’s property projects are mainly located in Sabah. The acquisition would allow both parties to leverage on respective resources, as Meridian is also involved in property development and construction.
That say, execution is key to success. Meridian has been in the red since FY14 while Permaja’s earnings track record has also been volatile. Meridian’s earnings were affected by the subdued property market while Permaju, which has been in the red since FY07, was weighed by high operating costs. Its property and automotive industries are exposed to weak consumer sentiment.
Permaju has been trying to diversify its earnings base in its bid to turn around. In Sep 2020, the group entered into a joint venture (JV) with VSolar Group (VSOL MK, Not Rated) to submit a tender to build and operate a Large Scale Solar 4 (LSS4) proposed 50MW plant in Seremban. It is also in talks with Anzo Holdings (ANZO MK, Not Rated) to collaborate in the manufacturing of gloves.
But until any deal materializes, its outlook will remain subdued. Permaju recorded a loss after tax of MYR6.6m in FY6/20, with its automotive, timber, and property development divisions all in the red. This does not help when the government implements partial or full lockdown to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, which in turn, would hurt the demand for automotive as well as properties.
Valuation wise, P/B methodology is preferred here due to Permaju’s weak earnings track record. At current price, the stock is trading at a trailing P/B of 0.9x, above its 3-year historical average P/B of 0.7x. The only silver lining is that, its net gearing stood at 0.01x at end-Jun 2020. Investors with lower risk appetite should stay on the sidelines for now."

Setujulah, permaju PA , kesan pengganda 5x, tak Payah commit banyak modal. Lagi pun Kini harga 4sen x 5 = 20sen=ordinary share price juga.
PERMAJU INDUSTRY: (MYR0.19) Acquisition to expand into West Malaysian property market
Maybank IB Retail Research
Permaju Industries acquired 100m ordinary shares of Meridian Bhd (MEDA MK, Not Rated), representing 16.97% of issued shares in Meridian, for MYR26m cash or MYR0.26/sh. The acquisition will be funded entirely via internally generated funds. Pursuant to the acquisition, Meridian is now an associate company of Permaju.
At MYR0.26/sh, Permaja is effectively valuing Meridian at a P/B of 1.2x. The acquisition would allow Permaju to expand its property ventures into the West Malaysian market. At present, Permaju’s property projects are mainly located in Sabah. The acquisition would allow both parties to leverage on respective resources, as Meridian is also involved in property development and construction.
That say, execution is key to success. Meridian has been in the red since FY14 while Permaja’s earnings track record has also been volatile. Meridian’s earnings were affected by the subdued property market while Permaju, which has been in the red since FY07, was weighed by high operating costs. Its property and automotive industries are exposed to weak consumer sentiment.
Permaju has been trying to diversify its earnings base in its bid to turn around. In Sep 2020, the group entered into a joint venture (JV) with VSolar Group (VSOL MK, Not Rated) to submit a tender to build and operate a Large Scale Solar 4 (LSS4) proposed 50MW plant in Seremban. It is also in talks with Anzo Holdings (ANZO MK, Not Rated) to collaborate in the manufacturing of gloves.
But until any deal materializes, its outlook will remain subdued. Permaju recorded a loss after tax of MYR6.6m in FY6/20, with its automotive, timber, and property development divisions all in the red. This does not help when the government implements partial or full lockdown to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, which in turn, would hurt the demand for automotive as well as properties.
Valuation wise, P/B methodology is preferred here due to Permaju’s weak earnings track record. At current price, the stock is trading at a trailing P/B of 0.9x, above its 3-year historical average P/B of 0.7x. The only silver lining is that, its net gearing stood at 0.01x at end-Jun 2020. Investors with lower risk appetite should stay on the sidelines for now."

""Cubetech Asia intends to submit its tender to build and operate a large-scale solar 4 (LSS4) proposed 50MW plant in Seremban subject to the terms and conditions stipulated in the JV agreement,"" the group said in a bourse filing.

""The project consists of terms including a concession period under a power purchase agreement with Tenaga Nasional Bhd, spanning 21 years starting from the commercial operation date by Dec 31, 2023,"" it added.
Under the agreement, Genbayu Gemilang will lease the required land to Cubetech Asia at no cost to undertake the project. The former will hold a 70% stake in Cubetech Asia, while Vsolar will hold the remaining 30% equity interest.
Permaju said Vsolar will manage and operate Cubetech Asia and assist the latter to secure financing for the project via a mix of equity and debt financing amounting to RM173.6 million and RM43.4 million respectively.
Vsolar is also to assist Cubetech to secure a bid bond amounting to RM1 million and a performance bond totalling RM10 million in the event the latter is awarded with the project.

In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, Permaju said the intended principal activity of PGSB is to manufacture, distribute, buy, sell and generally deal in rubber goods for industrial and commercial purposes.
Permaju said the rationale of the incorporation of PGSB is to facilitate the expansion of the business activities of the group and its subsidiaries,"" it said.
Permaju is involved in the distribution of Volkswagen and Ford franchise.
It is also involved in property development and owns big parcels of land in Sabah and Seremban, Negeri Sembilan.
The group owns 121.4 hectares of land in Seremban that is suitable for housing projects or industrial activities.
New Straits Times reported that Permaju may set up a production facility in Seremban, investing between RM150 million and RM200 million.
The group may start construction this year, subject to approvals from the relevant authorities.
Permaju intends to manufacture gloves among other rubber-related products for the export market and also to sell in Malaysia."

KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 13): An additional allocation of RM200 million has been provided to the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture Malaysia (MOTAC) for the implementation of the stimulus package under the Tourism Rehabilitation Plan for 2021.
Its Minister Datuk Seri Nancy Shukri in a statement today said apart from the allocations announced by the Finance Minister during the presentation of the Budget, there were several other provisions under MOTAC specifically to assist the tourism, arts and culture sectors.
""This is expected to stimulate and inject domestic spending consistently and in turn create a multiplier effect, especially for industries linked to the tourism, arts and culture sectors,"" she said.
She said the stimulus package included accommodation vouchers, tourist destination discounts, family travel package discounts as well as the revitalisation of arts and culture.
""Also included in this recovery plan are transportation discounts, shopping discounts and discount packages for frontliners as well as the ‘Meet in Malaysia Campaign’,"" she said.
Yesterday, she chaired an online engagement session with tourism and culture industry activists.
Among those involved were Malaysia Airlines, Air Asia, Malaysian Association of Tour and Travel Agents (MATTA), Malaysian Association of Hotel Owners (MAHO) and Malaysian Artistes' Association (Karyawan).
Nancy said the government also understood the situation of industry players who were badly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and would work to ensure the industry remained competitive and recovered quickly through various stimulus packages and recovery plans to be implemented based on the announced Budget."

Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd economist Adam Mohamed Rahim said the local bourse could expect to see further retracement in the glove counters due to Covid-19 vaccine news.
He also expects small capitalisation stocks to start making a comeback.
“We expect to see the FBM KLCI move between a support level of 1,580 and resistance level of 1,595 next week,” he told Bernama.
Asked whether Malaysia's third-quarter (3Q) gross domestic product (GDP) performance would influence trading next week, he said “it would not because many people have likely priced it in.”
During the week-just-ended, market sentiment was largely influenced by the expansionary Budget 2021 and Pfizer's successful Covid-19 vaccine Phase 3 trial."

Average new home prices in 70 major cities rose 0.2% in October from a month earlier, the slowest monthly growth rate since March and down from September's 0.4% growth, according to Reuters calculations based on data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
Compared with the same month a year earlier, home prices rose 4.3% in October, easing slightly from September's 4.6% growth.
Zhang Dawei, a Beijing-based analyst with property agency Centaline, said the tightening measures imposed by many cities have started to put pressure on home prices growth, especially as some have rolled out price caps on new home projects.
Sales promotion campaigns amid increasing housing supply during the traditional peak season also weighed on prices, Zhang added.
China's massive property market recovered quickly from the coronavirus crisis earlier this year, due to cheaper credit and looser purchase restrictions in some cities.
But with sales picking up steam, policymakers have taken a tougher stance since the start of the second half of the year, with regulators increasing scrutiny on financing activities of developers and buyers to prevent rampant growth in borrowing.
The NBS data on Monday also showed the number of cities reporting monthly price increases for new homes fell to 45 out of 70 from 55 in September.
In contrast with the softening prices data, China's October real estate investment rose 12.7% from a year ago, quickening from September's 12% and the fastest pace since July 2018, according to Reuters calculations based on data from NBS.
Property sales by floor area rose by a solid 15.3%, the highest in more than three years, while new construction starts expanded 3.5%, improving from last month's fall of 1.9%.
""The robust investment data was mainly fuelled by home construction activity, as developers' land purchase slowed down since the third quarter as regulators planned to impose rules to curb their debt levels,"" said Nie Wen, economist at Shanghai-based Hwabao Trust.
""I expect solid 5-10% year-to-date property investment growth to continue till the first half of next year if current sales momentum remains."" The Chinese Communist Party leadership recently reiterated its existing policy of discouraging speculation in the property market.
Analysts say strict buying restrictions and price caps are likely to remain in place, especially in higher-tier cities where pent-up demand is still robust.
In addition, deleveraging for homebuilders to tackle unbridled borrowing is becoming an increasingly important policy, an effort by authorities to institute a long-term supervision mechanism for the market. - Reuters"

Permaju, AT Systematization to roll out Sanitiser Gateway
By FocusM
04/28/2020
in Mainstream
PERMAJU Industries Bhd’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Team Japs Sdn Bhd, has teamed up with AT Engineering Solution Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AT Systematization Bhd (ATS), to distribute Penaclo solution via an engineered sanitising box.
In a joint statement, Permaju said the sanitising box (Sanitizer Gateway) is able to dispense sanitiser and disinfectant liquid solution evenly on any person walking through it.
Permaju executive director Teh Foo Hock said it is important to be ready for the post-Movement Control Order (MCO) as people would be confronted with a new environment.
On April 6, Permaju collaborated with Pentaweft Biotech Ltd for the supply of the Penaclo solution.
This solution is one of the very few sanitiser solutions in the world that was successfully tested by China’s State Key Lab of Respiratory Diseases, as effective in eradicating over 99.95% of the Covid-19 virus within the first 30 seconds of application, and is proven safe to animal cells.
“While looking for bottling and distribution partners for the sanitiser solution, our company came out with the idea of Sanitizer Gateway and decided to approach AT Systemization for the design and manufacturing of the Gateway.
“Time is of the essence. We need to roll out the product fast before the MCO is lifted,” said Teh.
Meanwhile, ATS managing director Choong Lee Aun said fabrication of the first Sanitiser Gateway will be ready soon, and the company has been getting many enquiries for its post-MCO products in the last few weeks.
“Both Permaju and AT Systematization aim to design, engineer, manufacture and distribute the Sanitizer Gateway that dispenses Penaclo solution to high-risk areas.
“This include hospitals, offices, restaurants, shopping malls, schools and public transportation hubs where high human foot traffic occurs on a daily basis, especially once the MCO is lifted by the government and until a definitive vaccine is found for the Covid-19 virus, manufactured and administered worldwide,” Choong said. — April 28, 2020, Bernama"

1) Company latest quarter accunt balance sheet ended sept20 have cash in hand 92mil with zero current and non current borrowing. Company in 18/11 private placement RM8mil and 21/1 P.P another RM8mil . Total cash in hand to date RM108mil. NET CASH 18 cents .
2) In 2020 , company disposed non-profit timber business and release a causing lost burden.
3) Company private placement at the lowest price at RM0.1612 and RM 0.1509 can see that these two batches are place for company related boss or operators.
4) Company venture business in solar panel project in September in Seremban and have sign selling power agreement with tenaga for 21 years period.
5) Company also venture in glove manufacturing sector via permaju glove. This will the themeplay of current market.
6) In july 20 , NSTP publish a news saying Permaju potential to be won a design and built highrise project worth RM1.2bil pending the kick start of project due to COVID. I believe the project will resume in Feb21 since our Malaysia vaccine arrival is targeted in Feb21. This was tremedously boost the permaju share price spike to the moon again.

Hardie is an existing 70%-owned subsidiary of Permaju.
In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Permaju has also proposed to undertake a private placement of up to 182,410,000 new ordinary shares representing 30% of its existing total number of issued shares to independent third-party investors to be identified later.
Permaju said Hardie is a property developer currently developing the Princess Heights Project in Sabah and upon completion of the acquisition, Hardie will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company.
“Thus, the acquisition will allow us to fully consolidate its interest in Hardie. In turn, this allows the company to derive all the future benefits that may be accrued from the ongoing development of the Princess Heights Project which is expected to enhance the future profitability and cash flow of the group,” it said.
Meanwhile, the proceeds raised from the proposed private placement will be utilised mainly for the settlement of the purchase consideration.
Upon completion of the proposed private placement, the enlarged capital base is also expected to further strengthen the financial position of the company, it said.
Moving forward, Permaju intends to focus on the development of the Princess Heights Project and the launch of its luxury car rental business as part of its effort to continuously enhance its business performance, maximise shareholders’ value and improve its financial position."

But this up 1 to 2 sen is chicken feed mah, why up so little leh ??
Timber & palmoil share r suffering from lack of production mah and also huge impairment losses on its assets mah & previous falling share price mah!
Thus they are jittery on recovery of palmoil & timber share loh!! They want to see actual profit b4 jump in loh!!
That means if u base on profit...as indicator that means the share price will be lagging loh!
Then why promote Wtk leh ??
1. The owner , directors and insiders already accumulating quietly without fanfare mah!
2. The palmoil & timber production volume of wtk already creeping up loh...this is further support by the record price of its commodities. Just imagine u have higher prices & higher volume....that will be a very important sign of higher big profit coming mah!
3. The share price already corrected over 3 yrs of downtrend previously, when there is a big shakeout of all the weak holders...u can only grow more optimistic as time past by loh!
4. Wtk is sitting on some prime land that invested at a very low cost near major town & city, they are good development mah!
5. With all the liquidity & quantitative easing & low interest rate environment, u can see big inflation will be coming loh...!! Wtk in commodities business plus very big cheap land bank is a very good inflation protector mah!
Based on the above i think wtk is the best pick to make profit & this is concur by sifu calvin findings mah!

Hardie is an existing 70%-owned subsidiary of Permaju.
In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Permaju has also proposed to undertake a private placement of up to 182,410,000 new ordinary shares representing 30% of its existing total number of issued shares to independent third-party investors to be identified later."

“Thus, the acquisition will allow us to fully consolidate its interest in Hardie. In turn, this allows the company to derive all the future benefits that may be accrued from the ongoing development of the Princess Heights Project which is expected to enhance the future profitability and cash flow of the group,” it said.
Meanwhile, the proceeds raised from the proposed private placement will be utilised mainly for the settlement of the purchase consideration."

==================================================
The figures in the PERMAJU announcement don't look correct based on the entitlement ratio of rights shares in MTOUCHE announcement.
As at entitlement date, 50,000 shares should be entitled to 300,000 shares (not 50,000,000 shares) with 150,000 free warrants D.
Put the figures aside, it looks like Permaju is very kind and generous to support MTOUCHE fund raising exercise by subscribing for more shares by way of excess application. If not for Permaju excess application, MTOUCHE rights issue will be under subscribed at higher percentage.
There goes the cash on hand from Permaju's company account
=========================================================
Finally they get the figure correct....
==========================================================
NON RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS PERMAJU INDUSTRIES BERHAD (""PERMAJU"" OR ""THE COMPANY"") - ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE ACQUISITION OF 185,050,000 RIGHTS SHARES TOGETHER WITH 92,525,000 FREE WARRANTS IN MTOUCHE TECHNOLOGY BERHAD BY ICONWORLD RESOURCES SDN. BHD., A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY
Reference is made to the Company’s announcements made on 14 June 2021 and 17 June 2021.
1. The background and details of the acquisition, including the number of Mtouches shares held by Iconworld as at the entitlement of Rights Shares, the entitlement of Iconworld under the Rights Shares and If relevant, the details of excess application
The Board of Permaju wishes to clarify that there was no share held by Iconworld as at the entitlement of Rights Shares. Iconworld purchased 50,000 units of Ordinary Rights from the open market at RM0.005 per unit with a total consideration of RM250.00 on 17 May 2021.
With the Ordinary Rights of 50,000 units, Iconworld was entitled to subscribe for the 50,000 units Rights Shares. Hence, Iconworld decided to subscribe for 50,000 units of Rights Shares at RM0.10 per unit and 185,000,000 units of Excess Rights Shares at RM0.10 each. Overall, Iconworld successfully subscribed for 185,050,000 units of Rights Shares together with 92,525,000 Free Warrant.
2. To provide further elaboration and justification on the rationale for the acquisition
The Company is of the view that the investment is expected to yield a positive impact to the Group in the foreseeable future as in accordance to Mtouches’ abridged prospectus which stated that the purpose of the Rights Issue is to raise sufficient fund to diversify into the healthcare business with a view to turnaround its performance via the new venture, given that expected strong demand in the healthcare sector in light of the present pandemic coupled with the strong performance of companies that are involved in the same industry and provide an alternative source of income to Mtouches’ current core business.
This announcement is dated 21 June 2021.
*Remark: the amendment was made on item 1 of the announcement dated 17 June 2021.
=============================================================
There is clear intention of PERMAJU directors to support MTOUCHE directors fund raising activity by merely buying 50,000 units of MTOUCHE-OR (costing RM250) followed by subscribing for 50,000 rights shares as well as subscribing excess 185,000,000 rights shares costing total of RM18,505,000 of the company fund."

On behalf of the Board, Mercury Securities wishes to announce that pursuant to the close of acceptance, excess applications and payment for the Rights Shares at 5.00 p.m. on 22 November 2021, the Company had received valid acceptances and excess applications for a total of 959,813,224 Rights Shares, representing 99.95% subscription of the total number of Rights Shares available for subscription under the Rights Issue.
No. of Rights shares % of total issue
Total valid acceptances 55,797,276 5.81
Total valid excess applications 904,015,948 94.14
Total valid acceptances and excess applications 959,813,224 99.95
Total Rights Shares available for subscription 960,272,695 100.00
Not subscribed for 459,471 0.05
The total number of excess Rights Shares available for allocation was 904,475,419. In view that the total number of excess Rights Shares applied for was 904,015,948, the Board has decided to allot the excess Rights Shares to all the entitled shareholders and/or their renouncee(s) and/or transferee(s) who have applied for the excess Rights Shares in full.
The Right Shares are expected to be listed on the Main Market of Bursa Securities on 3 December 2021.
This announcement is dated 29 November 2021.
https://www.klsescreener.com/v2/announcements/view/3464745
==================================
Only 5.81% for valid acceptance, meaning most retailers do not subscribe for the rights shares
Massive 94.14% for excess applications has to be the work of operators
Operators are cash rich to subscribe the excess rights shares at 7sen instead of buying from market at cheaper than 7sen.
==================================
Trade with care. Certain parties might fry up to dump the rights shares to release their fund"

And how u can spot the kon loh!
LU TAU BOH ??
This fintec people do not know...how to run business well....their objective is to play the stock market and operate their stock to kon people loh!
If their stock operations are not successful....their next objective to strip the company for cash or strip its other listed for cash to bail them out loh!
For example U will notice that Netx will buy into mlabs loh!
And fintec will buy into netx & so forth loh!
Where is the promise of Running Netx as the next Alibaba, Amazon, Alibaba, Facebook, Grab and tencent leh ?
It can never be mah!
Bcos this people do not know how to run real business well for profit mah!
The best they can do is to cook up very sexy stories like when GRAB is successful, they will come up with Gemsports loh!
When Gloves is successful they will come up with AT loh!
When Tech is popular they will come up with mlabs and xox loh!
The strategy is to entice u to get trap in their share mah!
Even if the stock that has huge undervaluation and Cash Rich like NETX with net cash more than its share price, it does not help loh!
Take for example for NETX....they bought up some of retail units in SG WANG Plaza for only token Rm 1................but after taking over the company.....NETX need to come up with millions & millions to settle the companies owing...b4 they can lay hands to any vacant retail lots mah!
So effectively...it is a bailing out of its cronies loh!
U SHOULD NOT TRUST THIS TYPE OF OWNER LOH!

Citing construction industry sources, the New Straits Times (NST) reported that the contract was awarded by a reputable property developer who owns a large tract of land within the Seri Kembangan/Serdang area, around 15km of Cyberjaya and south of Kuala Lumpur city centre.
The highest building within the development will have more than 50 floors, potentially making it the tallest building in the Seri Kembangan/Serdang area.

To be built in the next six to seven years, the project is believed to have a gross development value of around RM2.4 billion, reported NST.
“The developer decided to kick-start construction after the Penjana plan was announced as they are now more confident in the market recovering. They received approval to develop the project last year but had put it on hold and feel now is a good time to re-start,” NST quoted the source as saying.
To encourage growth within the property sector, the Home Ownership Campaign (HOC) was reintroduced, in which stamp duty exemptions were offered on the instrument of transfer as well as loan agreement for the purchase of homes priced from RM300,000 to RM2.5 million.
The government also offered an exemption on real property gains tax (RPGT) to Malaysians for the disposal of up to three properties from 1 June 2020 to 31 December 2021.
Permaju, via its subsidiary companies, is involved in timber plantation, trading of motor vehicles, construction, and property development.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT
This sustained growth underpins our prospects for the coming years, and we aim to capture the opportunities in the
local market. The Group has taken various initiatives to improve our financial performance and we expect growth to
stem from the following key areas:-
(i) Development of Princess Heights project and Mydin hypermarket
The Group diversified into property development through the acquisition of 70.0% equity interest in Hardie in 2010.
At present, the Group has completed Phase 1A and 1B of our Princess Heights development in Kota Kinabalu,
Sabah, which mainly comprise commercial properties. Moving forward, the Group is in the midst of developing a
4-storey hypermarket and intends to develop 6 additional phases of residential properties in the same development.
On 2 July 2021, the Group had completed the acquisition of the 30% equity interest in Hardie. In turn, this will
allow the Group to own Hardie wholly and fully recognise the future earnings and cash flow from the ongoing
development of the Princess Height Project which is expected to enhance the future profitability and cash flow
of the Group.
(ii) Venturing into luxury car rental business
The Group had completed private placement – 10% on 18 November 2020, which had raised a total of RM7.95
million. This proceed are intended to venture into the luxury car rental business as an expansion from the Group’s
existing automotive business. Furthermore, the Group intends to leverage on its existing resources and expertise
in the automotive business to ensure the success of the new luxury car rental business.
The target markets for the luxury car rental business are expected to be corporate users, high net worth individuals
as well as those conducting corporate and special events.
“Smith Zander International Sdn Bhd anticipates that in the longer term, after the crisis of the Covid-19 pandemic
ends and after the recovery of economic condition, the luxury car rental market is expected to be supported by
the rise of more affluent population and high–income households, growth of the meetings, incentives, conventions
and exhibitions (“MICE”) industry as well as increasing awareness of the sharing economy”.
(iii) Venturing in sales of luxury and premium EVs
The Group announced proposes to undertake a renounceable right issue to expand its automotive business by
venturing into the sale of luxury and premium EVs. This is aimed at tapping into a new market segment comprising
mainly high–income consumers and capitalise on the rise in environmental awareness among consumers.
EVs are an alternative mode of transportation for environmentally conscious consumers as it has lower carbon
dioxide emissions and carbon footprint, and is thus considered a more environmentally friendly option as compared
to a traditional combustion engine vehicle that uses fossil fuel to power its engine.
The EV market in Malaysia is at nascent stage as the attractiveness of EV is limited by relatively high prices, low
resale value and limited supporting infrastructure. Nevertheless, with the approval and implementation of the new
EV policy under NAP 2020, are expected to increase the demand of for EVs in Malaysia as EV becomes more
affordable and the EV supporting infrastructure becomes more accessible in Malaysia."
