WHEN Jtiasa was Rm2. 60 Calvin told Uncle Koon to sell.
Now at 50 sen is 80% discount
AND favorable factors:
1. India cut tax helps cpo competes against soy and other seed oils
2. China cut tax for palm feeds for its pigs
3. Indo and Msia increase biofuel usage give support
4. Cpo stocks expect to deplete soon
5. More cpo export to China as New Year approaching

AND favorable factors:
1. India cut tax helps cpo competes against soy and other seed oils
2. China cut tax for palm feeds for its pigs
3. Indo and Msia increase biofuel usage give support
4. Cpo stocks expect to deplete soon
5. More cpo export to China as New Year approaching

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000681.jsp?ftp=112","Mar 22, 2019 12:49 PM","commonsense","The company made a core net loss of almost RM50mil in the 1H19 due to weaker contribution from both the palm oil and timber divisions. Analyst are expecting 2H19 should to post better result but I am a bit sceptical of this given that the price of palm oil is still at an average of RM2100/tn in 3Q19. The most likely outcome would still be a loss (or a very small profit).
Based on the monthly timber report, 3Q19 result could potentially be worst than 2Q19. The total logs production in Jan and Feb 19 was only 23k cubic meter which is less than 60% of 2Q19 production output of 39.2k cubic meter. Unless you believe the company can churn out at least 16.3k cubic meter of logs in March, the 3Q19 result for the timber division would most likely be worse than the -RM7.7mil loss recorded in 2Q19.
I don't think that the palm oil industry will reverse their down cycle trend anytime soon given the general demand of the commodity is expected to go down in the future. China for example, is negotiating with US to take in more agriculture products from US which would potentially include soybean (or soybean oil). In general, Chinese consumption of oil would not actually grow that much. Any increase of soybean oil import from the US would actually means lower import for other types of oil from other countries (in particular palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia).
Another issue is on the European demand of palm oil which is expected to go down exponentially given the proposed ban of palm oil use in food and biofuels industries in the future. They have already agreed to phase out the use of palm oil in transport fuel by 2030. Some countries like France and Norway have already started to move away from palm oil.
With this in mind you need to have a slightly long-term investment horizon when buying into oil plantation companies like Jaya Tiasa as the return to upcycle might not be in the near future.
If you are looking to hedge your portfolio outside of Jaya Tiasa (due to its weak earnings outlook) I would recommend you to look at MBMR. (https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/stk/pt/5983.jsp)
MBMR is a direct proxy to Perodua via its 22.6% interest in the company. Valuation is cheap at only 6.4x PE based on FY18 profit of RM166mil. PB is low at only 0.7x BV.
FY19 should deliver another profit growth year to the company. Profit growth will again be driven by the performance of Perodua (via MBMR 22.6% holdings in Perodua) from the still strong sales of new Myvi, sales of SUV Aruz and the introduction of the newly revamp Alza sometime in the 2H19. Aruz which commands a higher margin compared to other models, will help improve the total profit margin of Perodua (which will flow to MBMR’s bottom line as well).
MBMR is expected to achieve a profit of RM200mil in 2019. At the current share price, the company is being valued at only 5.3x which is a lot lower than the industry average of 15x PE. As an example, UMW (another company with exposure to Perodua) is currently trading at a PE multiple of almost 20x.
Good luck."

Just realized there is such undervalue company in Bursa. I personally think it is the best time to collect JTIASA.
1) FCPO rebound to 2129
2) Major shareholder has been accumulating a lot at high price. See from
http://www.bursamalaysia.com/market/listed-companies/company-announcem...
Director bought higher than the current price. Why they so confident? Did they know something we dunnoe ?
3) NTA 1.39 which is around 60% discount. Seat with huge cash and assets with little debt
4) TOP shareholder amount to total of 70.2% of ticket which makes the public floating less than 30% who knows director also hold this floating ticket ?
5) for technical side it has break the resistance of 0.55 with volume. Bolinger band open upwards, STAND above Exponential moving average of 5 & 10 days( short term bullish) Price close above smooth moving average for 20 and 60 days. !
MACD start to golden cross. Volume healthy
No overbuy.
ALL IS GOOD! IF YOU MONEY TO BUY IN IS BETTER... BUY LOW SELL HIGH. THE BASIC PRINCIPLE IN INVESTING. WAIT UNTIL PEOPLE DISCOVER THIS GEM THEN IT WILL BE MORE THAN RM 1 !
Remember how Hibiscus go from 0.2 to 1.2 +
Remember how Dayang go from 0.4+ to 1.6+
many more
when result is bad- started to turn around no one notice dare to buy ...
wait until all research IB start to do massive attack/ marketing then people start to chase high....

KUALA LUMPUR (April 5): Malaysian palm oil futures surged to their highest in six weeks on Friday evening, charting a fifth straight session of gains, on expectations of dwindling stockpiles and improved exports.
The benchmark palm oil contract for June delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange was up 0.9% at 2,224 ringgit (US$544.16) a tonne at the close of trade.
It earlier rose 1.4% to 2,235 ringgit, its highest since Feb 25.
Palm is up this week by 5.6%, a second weekly gain in three.
A futures trader in Kuala Lumpur said the market jumped in the evening, on expectations of higher exports in April.
Palm oil futures had risen this week on expectations that March data from industry regulator, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, to show a decline in inventory levels.
Malaysia's palm oil stockpiles are likely to have dropped during March to its lowest level in five months, according to a Reuters survey, as a hefty jump in exports outpaced production gains.

The support and the resistance are identified as the 50% and the 61.8% retracements of the downtrend from RM2,344 to RM2,038.
The contract is due for a sharp move, as two trendlines are contracting to a point. Most likely, it could rise strongly, as it seems to be riding on a wave C from RM2,038, which is the third wave of a three-wave cycle from the Nov 27, 2018 low of RM1,940.
On the daily chart, palm oil is poised to retest a resistance at RM2,246, the 86.4% projection level of a downtrend from RM2,896. A break could lead to a gain to RM2,321.

www.klsescreener.com
BEIJING (April 24): Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad is expected to arrive in Beijing this evening for his five-day official visit to China. This is his second trip in less than a year since August last year.
The prime minister is here on invitation from China's president Xi Jinping to attend the second Belt & Road Forum that starts on Friday. Leaders from 36 countries will get together at Yanqi Lake, 60km from the capital, for a roundtable dialogue on the theme ""Strengthening Policy Synergy and Building Closer Partnership"".
The Malaysian ministers joining the prime minister in this visit include Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali, Foreign Affairs Minister Datuk Saifuddin Abdullah, International Trade and Industry Minister Datuk Ignatius Darell Leiking, Transport Minister Anthony Loke, Agriculture and Agro-based Industry Minister Datuk Salahuddin Ayub and Kedah Menteri Besar Datuk Seri Mukhriz Mahathir.
As usual the 93-year-old leader has planned a packed schedule for the official trip. There is no golfing session or sightseeing activities.
Dr Mahathir will kickstart his packed schedule with a visit to Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the China-based telecommunication giant that has caught the world's attention when its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou was arrested last December. Charged with bank and wire fraud to violate US sanctions against Iran, Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested by Canada at the request of the US deeming her and the company a national security threat.
The prime minister will also visit SenseTime Private Ltd, one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence in China, indicating Dr Mahathir's interest to get to know more about the advancement of technologies that the world's second largest economy, China, has achieved in recent years.
The highlights of Dr Mahathir's visit here will be the meetings with Xi at Diaoyutai State Guest House and Premier Li Keqiang at the Great Hall of China tomorrow.
The receptions at the two venues indicate that the host has considered Dr Mahathir's status as a highly respected honourable guest.
At the meetings, both sides are expected to discuss various bilateral, regional and international issues of mutual interests, according to Nuryante Mohd Yazid, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of Malaysia in China.
Dr Mahathir, and Li will also witness the signing of two memoranda of understanding (MoUs) here, both of which are on enhancing palm oil trade and cooperation as well as on enhancing cooperation in the development of industrial parks, infrastructure, logistics hub and transit oriented developments in pursuant to the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project, said Nuryante.
She elaborated that the signing of the first MoU will be between the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) and China Chamber of Commerce of Import and Export of Foodstuff, Native Products and Animal Byproducts (CFNA), while the other will be between Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA) and China Communication Construction Company Ltd (CCCC), respectively.
On his third day in the capital, Dr Mahathir will be attending a special program with Proton Holdings Bhd in Beijing, where he will be witnessing the exchange of documents among national car manufacturers and advanced companies in China.
Notably, it was in Hangzhou last year whereby Chinese automaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co Ltd (Geely), which controls a 49.9% equity stake in Proton, signed a heads of agreement with Proton to form a joint venture (JV) for Proton to assemble and market cars in China.
Proton then revealed its plan to set up manufacturing facilities in China, and the JV was formed to also help Proton develop a network of dealers to market its cars in China.
Before Dr Mahathir heads home, he is scheduled to meet key investors, international capital market analysts as well as the renowned business community based in Beijing.

十年后的今天，2019年，我们是否有机会让当年的历史重演，让股价从2019年低点45sen,一路涨到2022年的3块钱，我相信是有可能的，大家拭目以待吧。"

Listed newfields come up with inital debt of hundreds of millions,preparing & buying and and planting is not cheap! Esp if it's well planned for efficient harvesting and yield.
The company becomes wildly profitable after the loans are paid off. Which takes years of ""good"" prices, but a windfall year could settle it all early. What's left is owning a share in a debt free, brand new, top notch, cash flow generating plantation.
Market cap of 1b now? It's at least more than 2.5b spent on capex & assets alone. It's like you go buy a 100 acre plantation with palm oil mill that he build for 10m, and u buy for 5m.

And it's for sale for 1 Billion. And at 3100 CPO price, 82k CPO production -> 255m revenue @ 153m profit just from CPO. In 5 months they can pay all their hutang and the corrosive interests.
and all cash flow then can use to plant their forest concession with more and more plants.

Its earning performance has been overall fluctuating in last five years, whereby its earning per share overall fluctuated from -27.48 sen to 5.6sen. Making losses in all of last five years.
In the 2019 financial year, there was a Net Loss of RM265.3 million down from the previous Net Loss of RM69.8 million. The reason for the widening loss were due to 23% lower CPO selling price, signifcant lower sales volume for our timber products, and the derecogniton and reversal of deferred tax assets on unabsorbed tax losses in loss making subsidiaries amountng to RM80 million recognized during the year. Loss per share was 27.48 sen compared to 7.34 sen in the previous year.

Palm oil is largely consumed by the lower-middle class in India as it is an affordable edible oil (priced lower by 50 to 100 Indian rupees per 10kg or US$100 to US$200 per tonne compared with other edible oils), according to GG Patel and Nikhil Research Co (India).
Its managing partner Govindbhai G. Patel pointed out that palm oil was the main oil used by the hotel, restaurant and catering sector as well as by chips and savoury snack manufacturers.
___
As such, India would need at least eight million metric tonnes of palm oil by 2015 if palm oil maintains its market share of around 35-37% of the total oils and fats consumption, said Fatimah at the two-day event in Mumbai, themed Managing Global Challenges Through Innovative Partnerships.

Crude palm oil (CPO) futures on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange (BMD) retreated 10% to hit limit down near the end of the trading session Tuesday, with the benchmark April contract closing RM286/mt down from the previous settle at RM2,575/mt. While the fall was loosely attributed to the coronavirus outbreak and its resulting adverse impact on consumer demand for palm oil, and a number of market participants cited the liquidiation of positions by speculators, as well as the spillover effect of reactionary weakess in wider global markets as complementary reasons for the drastic fall in in the futures. (Source: Platts)
UOB Kay Hian Comments:
Compare to SARS in 2003, at the peak in Feb – Jun 03 palm oil price has weaken about 18.5% from its high end-Dec 02 on the similar concern of demand destruction. However, CPO price recovered from Jul 03 onwards as palm oil inventory drawdown.
Palm oil inventory is expecting to continue downtrend at least for next 4 to 5 months due to the weak production. Palm oil production in Malaysia and Indonesia is not going to be good due to the impact of dry weather in 2019 and cut back on fertilizer application in 2H18 and 2019. Hence, we conclude that the selldown yesterday was overreacted and price should recover to reflect the supply tightness especially in 1H20.
Cooking oil demand is relatively stable. Less eating out may reduce the demand from HORECA sector but this will be compensated by the demand from consumer packs (more home cooking). We also foresee better opportunity for palm oil coming from lack of soybean oil supplies as a result so lower soybean crushing. The fear of consuming meat in China now may lead to slower demand for pork and poultry which could ultimately reduce the demand for soybean meal. With low soybean oil inventory in China now and not expecting any pick up of soybean crushing volume soon, this may translate into better opportunity for palm oil in China."

India could soon return to Malaysia for palm oil
KUALA LUMPUR (May 5): India is seen as having very little choice and could soon turn to Malaysia and start importing back, especially if the COVID-19 pandemic situation in Indonesia gets worse and the country goes into full lockdown as most of the countries are doing at the very moment.
“The country (India) could step up purchases in the coming months as shipments are reportedly easing up,” the Malaysian Palm Oil Council (MPOC) said in its second quarter outlook for palm oil in the South Asian countries.
However, the current lockdown conditions will be the determining factor as to whether the required import volumes can be achieved or continue to add to the current woes, it said."

Tech sold down because Trump hammers China tech companies and huawei
Others sold down because Oct loan moratorium over so money will leave Klse to pay loans
Now one class of stocks got support
Palm oil
Because
1. China North East got great flood wiping off its bread basket of corn and soybean
2. Last year China culled pigs due to disease
Pigs need lots of soymeal feed
3. So China will buy more soybean from Usa
4. Usa also got drought so less soybean
5. Prices of soybean surged
Very good for palm oil as India connot expensive soybean oil turn to Malaysia palm oil
6. Plus more people stay home eat more biscuit
Biscuit got high palm oil content as well as Malaysian milo and kit kat...full of palm oil
Ofi, hup Seng, Apollo and hwatai showed increasing revenue from biscuit sale due to mco lock down
Many getting fat on palm oil from KitKat, milo and snacks of biscuit, cakes, ice cream all got high palm oil content

1. China hit by 3 massive typhoons in its North-West. Heilongjiang the bread basket of China has been flooded. It's soybean crops are destroyed
2. As a result China must buy soybean from Usa.
3. Last year China swine fever wiped off many pigs. Soybean is also needed as feedmeal for pigs
3. Us now in drought as soybean production is less.
4. Argentina and Brazil soybean crops won""t be ready until Feb 2021
5. So with increasing demand and dwindling supply soybean prices are rocketing upward
6. Soybean going up will pull up palm oil as their prices are co-related
7. India now will turn to cheaper palm oil as soyoil becomes too expensive
8. Malaysian palm oil stocks are depleting due to lack of Indonesia workers due to mco
Again less stock means higher prices
9. Last quarter result of March to May cpo prices were weak. Buy cpo prices have surged from June to August quarters so palm oil stocks are expected to report very good results in Nov 2020
10. Best of the best now in Sept 2020 soybean oil has almost reached Usd35.00 and Cpo future going to cross Rm3,000 barrier
All these converging factors will propel palm oil stocks into bull run just like coronavirus powered up medical gloves

“国内豆油现货价格连续走高，各地基差报价上升150—250元/吨不等，过高基差可能导致走货有一定的迟滞，但是，近期下游买家仍有备货需求，加之豆油可流通的库存并不高，豆油高基差的状态短期或将持续。美豆价格再创新高利好国内豆油价格，国内豆油高基差状态持续，豆油价格或延续强势。鉴于目前豆油已运行至阶段高点，操作上注意高位风险。”谢雯说。
菜油方面，目前国内菜籽压榨量处于较低水平，沿海菜油库存在24万吨，同比下降46%。目前加拿大进口菜油有利润，但鉴于8月出现过进口菜油入关不畅的事件，菜油实质进口量不佳。"

Because if soybean price is up it will be more expensive for soy oil
And India cannot afford to buy expensive soybean oil will then buy the cheaper palm oil
And if demand for palm oil goes up so will be its selling prices
That is why China after 5 typhoon got to buy up all corn and soybean from world markets in panic
This will last for at least 6 months till next soybean harvests from Argentina and Brazil in the southern hemisphere while the North is going into winter months
And then palm oil will reign as king as there is no competing vege oil around
Palm oil stocks will go into a 6 months Bull run from now
It might turn into a Superbull if Both Argentina and Brazil soyoil crops fail due to drought
So just buy and hold all palm oil stocks for at least 3 to 6 months
This is a sure fire winner for holding precious palm oil shares now."

Indonesia, the world's largest palm oil exporter, plans to finish research into biodiesel containing 40% palm oil by November, the head of the energy ministry's research department said on Wednesday.
The country will implement the mandatory use of biodiesel containing 40% palm oil, known as B40, in July 2021 as it seeks to increase domestic palm oil use while slashing regular diesel imports......
Malaysian companies could take advantage from the news that Indonesia may further increase palm oil export levies in future to support its ambitious biodiesel programme. Indonesia raised its levy on crude palm oil exports in June to $55 per tonne and the government has pledged 2.78 trillion rupiah financial assistance for the programme.

Amost every one was enjoying increasing profits. Many have resigned from their jobs to do full time trading in the stock market. Stock market tips and conversations were the order of the day. Everywhere in offices, homes, coffee shops, markets, eating places people talked only about the next “Limit Up” stocks.
In every trading Hall or Room there is no available seats. In RHB Bank HQ there isn’t even standing room. Cramped, jammed and packed with traders and specualtors from all walks of life. It Was The GoGo Years Before The Asian Financial Crisis!
One man stood out. Peter Lim of Singapore. He sold all his shares near the very peak and bought into just one counter – WILMAR the Plantation Stock.
On hindsight it was an uncanny but very accurate move. Next year in July 2nd 1997 George Soros attacked the Thai bath. The Thai bath collapsed and then contagion spread to Malaysia, Singapore, Hk, Korea, Indonesia – One by One Their Stock Markets Collapsed like tent pins.
At the height KLSE was 1332 and at the bottom it was only 262 points – A Crash of 81%
Nobody fully invested could have escaped such a carnage. It was a disaster for many. Tens of thousands went bankrupt. Many Banks & Financial Institutions were insolvent. Before the Asian Financial Crisis there were 49 Banks and Credit Companies in Malaysia. With the devastating carnage less than 10 Banks now standing. The rest became history.
Tycoon Peter Lim invested $10 millions into Wilmar – the plantation stock owned by Robert Kuok.
How come Peter was so “chun chun”? All $10 millions into one single stock. And he was right on target. Four years later in 2,000 Peter Lim “THE REMISIER KING” of Singapore sold his Wilmar shares for a cool $1.5 Billions!
So plantation stock investment if timed well can make you a billionaire!
As for Robert Kuok he became the Richest Man No. One in All of Malaysia with over Rm40 Billions.
Ha! Are we now entering another phase of market doom? Maybe yes or maybe no.
But This Is For Sure:
A POWERFUL EL NINO IS NOW ONGOING
Hmmm?
Let’s SEE if Plantation Stocks will create more millionaires and billionaires this round."

在每个交易大厅或房间中都没有空的座位。在RHB银行总部甚至人潮多的连站的地方都没有。这些地方都挤满了各行各业的商人和专业人士。这些情景发生在亚洲金融危机爆发前！
在这个时期，却有一个人脱颖而出。他就是新加坡的Peter Lim。他在接近股市高峰期时，卖掉了所有股票。然后，只买了一档股票– WILMAR种植园股票。
事后看来，这是一个奇怪但非常精准的举动。在1997年7月2日，乔治·索罗斯（George Soros）袭击了泰珠。泰珠崩溃后，骨牌效益蔓延到了其它国家，例如马来西亚，新加坡，香港，韩国，印度尼西亚。
当时的KLSE最高时为1332点，最低仅剩下262点–暴跌了将近81％。
对于许多人来说，这是一场灾难。数以万计的人破产。许多银行和金融机构资不抵债。亚洲金融危机之前，马来西亚有大概49家银行和信贷公司。如今，剩下的也大概10家。其余的已成为历史。
Peter Lim当时投资了10 million在Wilmar。Wilmar是Mr. Robert Kuok持有的种植园股票。
为何Peter Lim会如此的精准投资？把所有的资金投资在一档股票里面。而且他是正中目标。四年后，新加坡的Peter Lim“ THE REMISIER KING”以15亿的高价出售了其Wilmar股份！
因此，如果时机合适的，种植园股票投资是可以使您成为富翁！
我们现阶段是否正在进入市场厄运的另一阶段吗？让我们拭目以待。
但肯定的是：
EL NINO现象正在酝酿当中
让我们期待种植园股票是否将在这一轮创造更多的百万富翁和亿万富翁。"

(i) weather anomalies resulting in poorer-than-expected output growth -*Let's hope for a good weather the next coming 3 months*.
(ii) lower than-expected CPO price achieved – *On Target and currently CPO is Up trending*
(iii) negative policies imposed by import countries – *Positive*. The exemption of CPO export duty by the government of Malaysia till Dec 2020 will be positive for CPO exports (especially to India) and will help support CPO price which is expected to be under pressure in 3Q20 due to the anticipated stockpile build-up amid seasonal production recovery
(iv) unfriendly policies imposed by the Malaysian and Indonesian government on upstream or downstream segments – *Already factored on India’s move to restrict the importation of refined palm oil*. This will result in quicker build-up of MPOB stockpile when output recovers from 2Q20, and cap CPO price upside
(v) sharply lower crude oil prices which makes palm biodiesel demand not viable – *Brent has already breached USD 40*
(vi) weaker competing oil prices (like soybean and rapeseed- *On Target*. Alternative Oil Prices is on the rise which make Palm Oil very attractive.

The Palm Oil, whose scientific name is Elaeis guineensis Jacq, originates from West Africa. It were first brought into this country by the British in the 1870’s as an ornamental plant in their gardens. However, other countries were already familiar it and its uses. Among the earliest evidences of its usage were
• Traces of my ancestors found in burial urns aged 5000 years in Abydos, Egypt
• The barter of palm oil for salt centuries ago
• A lubricant for engines and in the manufacture of candles, soap and margarine in Europe during the 19 th century.
Palm Oil started to make Malaysia its home on a large scale in the 1960’s. This started when the Malaysian Government introduced a land cultivation scheme for the purpose of planting oil palm trees.The purpose of this scheme was to eradicate poverty and raise the standard of living for the rural population. Today, palm oil grows and flourish in palm oil plantations which can be found throughout the country, from Perlis to Sabah."

Uncle Koon first posted on Jaya Tiasa in year 2014 when Jtiasa was around
Rm2.60 & Cpo prices were over Rm2,800 to Rm3,100 per ton
When Calvin saw Shale oil danger from USA I told Uncle Koon to sell his Jtiasa
Uncle Koon then sold Jtiasa like no tomorrow from Rm2.60 to only Rm1.00 & disappeared from i3 forum for 7 months
He resurfaced again to give the reason why he stopped because of abusive posts
So later he posted articles which all canot post comments
Calvin thinks now JTiasa (Giant Treasure) is worth taking another look because CPO has rebounded strongly near Rm3,000

Date: 9th October 2020
Solvent Extractors Association of India organised a webinar yesterday titled “World Price Outlook for Vegetable Oils and Meals”. There were three speakers i.e. Thomas Mielke from Oil World, Dorab Mistry from Godrej International and James Fry from LMC International. Here are the key takeaways from the webinar: -
James Fry said that rains and good palm prices would encourage better estate maintenance in Malaysia and Indonesia, leading to improved palm production in year 2021F. Rains would boost CPO supply in early-2021F and in the meantime, there would be a seasonal pick-up in production in 4Q2020. Peak palm production may be delayed by a month or two from the usual month of October or November in Malaysia.
In terms of demand, many companies in the HORECA sector (hotels, restaurants and catering) may not survive without government support. Families in low income countries may be trading down to smaller bottles of cooking oil. James Fry did not give a price forecast.
Thomas Mielke said that CPO prices may hover around US$700/tonne (RM2,905/tonne) in 1H2021. He forecasts global production of palm oil to increase by 3.5mil to 4mil tonnes in 2021F. CPO output in Indonesia is estimated to rise by 3mil tonnes in 2021F from about 43mil tonnes in 2020E. Thomas Mielke expects CPO production in Malaysia to be flat in 2021F.
He added that global soybean supply is ample currently in spite of weather-related losses in the US. He expects world soybean supply to increase by 21mil tonnes in 2020E/2021F as Brazil is envisaged to record a record output of 132.5mil tonnes (2019/2020E: 126.5mil tonnes).
Dorab Mistry believes that CPO production in Malaysia would be flat at 19.9mil tonnes in 2020E compared with market expectations of a decline. We believe that this implies that 4Q2020 production would be strong as Malaysia’s CPO output fell by 4.7% YoY in 8M2020. He did not give a production forecast for 2021F although he said that palm supply would be good.
Dorab has suggested a dynamic biodiesel mandate to the Indonesia government whereby if CPO prices exceed US$600/tonne, the biodiesel mandate would be reduced to B25 from B30. If CPO prices exceed US$700/tonne, the biodiesel mandate would be reduced further to B20. With this, the biodiesel mandate would still be implemented but at the same time, the smallholders would not be affected by the CPO export levy. Currently, Indonesia implements the B30 biodiesel mandate with subsidies from the CPO export levy of US$55/tonne.

Indonesia gears up for heavy rainfalls as La Nina phenomenon comes
INDONESIA
Saturday, 17 Oct 2020
Motorists take shelter from heavy rain under a bus shelter on Jl. Sudirman in South Jakarta. - Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency has expected parts of the country to experience an anomalous intensity of rainfall in the near future. - The Jakarta Post/ANN
JAKARTA, Oct 17 (Xinhua): Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency has expected many parts of the country to experience an anomalous intensity of rainfall in the near future.
They include provinces of Lampung, South Sumatra, West Sumatra, Bengkulu, Riau, among others, head of the agency Dwikora Karnawati said on Saturday (Oct 17) after attending a virtual cabinet meeting.
On the La Nina phenomenon, Karnawati pointed out that in the October-November period, the phenomenon would affect most of the Indonesian areas except Sumatra.
""Although La Nina will not affect Sumatra, the intensity of monthly downpours is high as it could reach 400 millimeters per month occurring from the tip of Aceh province to the southern tip of Lampung province,"" she noted.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has called on relevant authorities to anticipate and gear up for possible natural disasters and La Nina's impacts on various sectors in Indonesia.
""Impacts of La Nina on agricultural products should be well calculated. The same should also be done on the sectors of fisheries and transportation,"" the president told a cabinet meeting in Jakarta on Tuesday.
So far this year, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency recorded 2,256 natural disasters including floods, whirlwinds, landslides and forest fires, which left 307 people dead, 25 missing and 469 injured.
The disasters also damaged 34,100 houses, 641 educational facilities, 672 houses of worship and 131 health facilities.
The Jakarta Post, reported that seven neighborhood units (RTs) in South Jakarta and West Jakarta were inundated after a heavy downpour in the capital on Friday afternoon.
Jakarta Disaster Mitigation Agency official Insaf said two RTs in Bangka subdistrict, South Jakarta, and five others in Srengseng, North Sukabumi, and Kebon Jeruk, West Jakarta, were flooded until 5pm on Friday (Oct 16).
“The flooding ranged from 10 to 70 centimeters in depth. Despite the flooding, no residents have taken shelter yet, ” Insaf said on Friday, as quoted by kompas.com.
In addition to the seven RTs, at least 19 roads in the city were flooded, including Pramuka in Matraman, East Jakarta, and Ciledug Raya in South Jakarta.
The Meteorological, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) warned that torrential rain accompanied by lightning and strong winds would hit many parts of the country between Friday and Sunday.
The agency previously warned that the ongoing La Nina weather phenomenon could increase total precipitation in Indonesia by up to 40 per cent until February 2021.
La Nina, a periodic cooling of sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, tends to cause extreme weather in the archipelago. The BMKG has warned authorities that continuous extreme weather could result in flooding and landslides in many parts of the country."

11-03-2020
Malaysian plywood manufacturers have lost market share in Japan, their key export market, due to stiff competition from Indonesian suppliers and the sharp increase in local production of plywood from domestic softwood resources.
Statistics from the Sarawak Timber Industry Development Corp. (STIDC) reveal that Sarawak plywood export volumes fell to about 1.12 million cubic metres, worth RM2.26 bil (FOB), in 2019 from 1.43 million cubic metres (RM3.03 bil) in 2018 and 1.74 million cubic metres (RM3.27 bil) in 2017.
Despite the drop in sales, in 2019 Japan was the top buyer of Sarawak plywood absorbing 733,051 cubic metres (RM1.59 bil) or more than 70 per cent of the state’s total plywood exports. Sarawak log export volumes dropped to 1.29 million cubic metres worth RM722.2mil in 2019 against 1.42 million cubic metres valued at RM773 mil in 2018."

More than just tax exemption lah
These are powerful boosters
1. 3 major typhoon hit heilongjiang China bread basket wiped off all China Soy and Corn crops
China's agriculture has been wrecked by major typhoon and flood this year
So must buy more vegetable oil
2. Same flood also happened in India
Indian crop production crashed due to floods
So both India and China not enough vege oil
3. As a result of floods prices of sunflower oil, canola oil, soybean oil and corn oil now at all time high
This pulls up palm oil as it is still the cheapest
4. Last year swine flu wiped off pigs in China
So lots of soy meal and palm kernal cakes now needed to boost pig production in China
5. USA in drought so less soybean and corn leading to higher soybean prices
This will lift up palm oil
6. Drought in Argentina and Brazil also deplete soybean and corn production
7. Typhoon in greece, Thailand and Vietnam , Korea, mexico and Japan also wiped out crops
8. La nina effect
Too much rainfall in certain countries
Hot drought in others
Cause huge shortage of food
9. All these are converging factors for multi year shortage of vege oil world wide
10. A superbull in palm oil stocks might commence soon"

Warren Buffett looks at three character traits in people who surround him: integrity, energy and intelligence. He says, if you don't have the first, the last two will kill you. In fact, if they don't have integrity, he would rather his managers be lazy and dumb.
""Integrity is like oxygen. If you don't have it, nothing else matters.""
""Be honest. Never lie under any circumstances. Just basically lay it out as you see it. Simply speak openly and frankly.""
Integrity is also about principles, full disclosure and openness.
Integrity is a choice, and the lack of it most often leads to self destruction.

Fantastic Day for all Farmers..
Prevailing CPO Price as of yesterday is RM 3354. Cost of producing is between RM 1500-1800. This will be good for our farmers. So we expect more movements in this counter due to feel good effect on the latest Indian Oil Palm Contract, Bullish FCPO (Jan FCOP has already breaches RM 3,144), current CPO prices plus the feel good effect of 2021 Budget which will be tabled tomorrow.
Well done Everyone !

Current price RM0.765
Target price RM1.55
Jtiasa is a sarawak palm oil and timber company controlled by Tan Sir Tiong Hiew King. It owns 69,589 hectares (171,958acres) fully matured palm oil plantations in Sarawak.
In the financial year of 2016, Jaya Tiasa made a profit of RM82millions or 5.6 earning per share. In the same year the highest share price of Jtiasa was RM1.79. The cpo average selling price of the year is RM2,770 or average ffb selling price of RM543. Plywood prices of the same year stand above USD500+ per sheet.
In the financial year 2020, Jaya Tiasa made a loss of RM129millios or loss per share of 7.45cents. In the same year the highest share price was RM1.12. The cpo average selling price is RM2,177 or average ffb selling price of RM420. If we read the last quarter result of Jtiasa, it made a loss of RM36millions, but in fact excluded the one time impairment of timber session, it actually made a profit of RM62millions in just one quarter! Besides that, Jtiasa achieved net cash flow of RM181millions and debt reduced by RM160millions in the same year.
In the latest Jtiasa annual report, we also found that Dynaquest’s super investor Mr Neoh Soon Kean emerged as top thirty shareholder of Jtiasa holding 2,373,000 shares while another super investor Mr Kong Goon Khing emerged as top thirty shareholder who held 16,000,000 shares. (Mr Kong is also the 4th largest shareholder of another palm oil company - TDM Berhad.)
Jtiasa is recovering drastically in 2020 after making a few years of losses. The recovery is due to plywood price recovering to above USD519 per sheet in Oct 2020 and CPO price recovering to over RM3,300 as at 6th Nov 2020. Without considering the impairment, the actual profit of Jtiasa in year 2020 should be above RM120millions. The management is very smart to use a financial method to save at least RM30millions tax expense for Jtiasa in 2020!
In a nutshell, we are expecting Jtiasa to make a net profit of RM150millions in financial year 2021or forward PE of just 5.06times. So we fix a target price of RM1.55 or target PE of 10times for the financial year of 2021. We are expecting Sarawak state election in 2021 and Jtiasa could lead Sarawak themes play, while a favourable pricing of CPO in next few months due to supply reduction and also higher selling price of plywood due to the US election. (Citizens bought plywood to seal their shop in case of riot due to public unhappiness towards the presidential poll result.)"

Current price RM0.765
Target price RM1.55
为何我喜欢Jaya Tiasa （4383https://www.facebook.com/HollandStock/posts/4633335180041605）
现价：0.765
目标价：1.55
Jtiasa是一家由丹斯里张晓卿控制的砂拉越棕榈油和木材公司。它在砂拉越拥有69589公顷（171958英亩）完全成熟的棕榈油种植园。
在2016财政年度，Jaya Tiasa盈利8200万令吉或每股5.6分。同年，Jtiasa的最高股价为1.79令吉。该年的CPO平均售价为RM2,770 ; 鲜果串平均售价为RM543。同年的夹板价格超过每sheet 500美元以上。
在2020财政年度，Jaya Tiasa亏损1.29亿令吉或每股7.45分。同年的最高股价是RM1.12。 CPO的平均售价为RM2,177 ；鲜果串的平均售价为RM420。如果我们阅读Jtiasa的最后一个季度业绩，它亏损了3,600万令吉，但实际上不包括木材交易的一次性减值，实际季度盈利为6,200万令吉！除此之外，Jtiasa在同年取得了1亿8100万令吉的净现金流量，以及减少了1亿6千万令吉的债务。
在最新的Jtiasa年度报告中，我们还发现Dynaquest的超级投资者梁孙健老师成为Jtiasa持有2,373,000股股票的前三十名大股东，而另一位超级投资者Kong Goon Khing成为了持有16,000,000股股票的前三十名股东。 （孔先生也是另一家棕榈油公司TDM Berhad的第四大股东。）
在经历了几年的亏损之后，Jtiasa在2020年实现了大幅度的复苏。该复苏是由于夹板价格在2020年10月恢复到每sheet 519美元以上，而CPO价格在2020年11月6日恢复到3,300令吉以上。如果不考虑减值，Jtiasa在2020年的实际利润应超过1.2亿令吉。管理层非常聪明，可以使用财务方法在2020年为Jtiasa节省至少3000万令吉的税款！
简而言之，我们预计Jtiasa在2021财政年度将会实现1.5亿令吉的净利润，或预测市盈率仅为现股价RM0.765的5.06倍市盈率。因此，我们将2021财政年度的目标价格设定为1.55令吉或10倍的市盈率。我们预计2021年砂拉越州选举Jtiasa可能会成为砂拉越的主题股，同时由于供应减少的原因未来几个月对CPO的价格有利。 由于美国大选，夹板的销售量大涨，夹板的售价也提高了。 （由于担心大众对总统选举结果感到不满，市民购买了夹板以密封商店，以防发生骚乱。）"

Before Convid 19, no one was looking at Glove Industry. Mabel came on board into the Glove Industry when Teresa Kok made a pledge that Malaysia is donating 18 million Gloves to China to fight Coronavirus. At that time, Mabel was thinking its part of giving back to help the Victim. Little did she knew that this industry is about to rocket and change many people's life. This is the beauty when you gives, God gives you back in Multiple Folds...Those that has invested in Gloves before March would have made 1000 Profits.
Likewise, this Food Crisis will be another game changer. Plantation will be the next industry that will rocket just like what we have seen in the Healthcare Industry. Plantation is currently rank No 3 in the 15 Sectors that Mabel Inc has invested. It’s interesting to see Mabel's Top 4 sectors are doing extremely well. The main reason is that these industries have a big impact on the Global Community.
Now let's get back to Mickeymouse...

COMMODITIES
Monday, 07 Sep 2020
KUCHING: Malaysian plywood manufacturers’ exports of panel products to their key market in Japan have been hit hard by the drastic cut in imports by the Japanese buyers.
Adding to the weak export demand is the soft prices of plywood products which have hurt the bottom line of Malaysian suppliers.
Malaysian manufacturers are also losing their market share in Japan to Indonesian plywood manufacturers and Japan’s softwood plywood producers.
Plywood manufacturers in Sarawak have raised the prices of their products to offset the high production costs brought about by the steep hike in timber premium as well as rehabilitation and development cess, thereby making their products less competitive in the export market.
In the first six months of 2020 (1H20), Japan’s plywood imports volume fell by 28% compared to 1H19, with Indonesia and Malaysia accounting for more than 80% of that country’s total plywood imports."

Malaysia,plywood manufacturers,Indonesian suppliers,Japan,supply
Malaysian plywood manufacturers have lost market share in Japan, their key export market, due to stiff competition from Indonesian suppliers and the sharp increase in local production of plywood from domestic softwood resources.
Statistics from the Sarawak Timber Industry Development Corp. (STIDC) reveal that Sarawak plywood export volumes fell to about 1.12 million cubic metres, worth RM2.26 bil (FOB), in 2019 from 1.43 million cubic metres (RM3.03 bil) in 2018 and 1.74 million cubic metres (RM3.27 bil) in 2017.
Despite the drop in sales, in 2019 Japan was the top buyer of Sarawak plywood absorbing 733,051 cubic metres (RM1.59 bil) or more than 70 per cent of the state’s total plywood exports. Sarawak log export volumes dropped to 1.29 million cubic metres worth RM722.2mil in 2019 against 1.42 million cubic metres valued at RM773 mil in 2018."

“In June, arrivals from Malaysia were down 26% compared to May (2020) and year-on-year, June imports were around 13% down.
“In contrast, the volume of June imports from Indonesia was around the same level in May and were marginally lower than in June 2019, ” said International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) in its latest Tropical Timber Market Report (Aug 16-31).
Indonesia has overtaken Malaysia in exporting 407,400 cubic metres of plywood to Japan in 1H20 from 380,200 cubic metres in 1H19.
Japan also imports plywood products from China and Vietnam.
According to WTK Holdings Bhd, its plywood revenue in the April-June 2020 quarter (2Q20) slumped by 30% because of weaker demand from Japan, which was affected by the slowdown of construction and new houses.
Coupled with a 89% plunge in logs revenue in 2Q20, WTK recorded a sharp drop in timber turnover to RM49mil (2Q19: RM111.7mil) and widened segment’s loss to RM13.8mil (-RM7.4mil).
Going forward, WTK said the demand for its plywood from Japan and logs from key market India is expected to remain soft."

As a private investor, Lim has interests in sectors from palm oil to medical.
He got involved in a start-up Indonesian palm oil company, Wilmar International, and invested $10 million in 1996.
Unfortunately, in the next year, the Indonesian economy was weakening and then the Indonesian currency fell from 2,500 rupiah against the US dollar to 16,000 rupiah. The nation’s economy would go on to be impacted badly by the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis.
However, Lim shouldered on as he saw the potential in palm oil.
You have to invest with a longer-term mindset. You buy a good stock, leave it there for 10 years. Come 10 years, this dollar can be many, many multiples. The minimum length of my investments are five to six years, if not 10 to 12 years. – Peter Lim, in an interview with The Business Times in 2007
Fast forward 10 years later, businessman Robert Kuok decided to inject his Malaysian palm oil operations into Wilmar in 2007 after the demand for palm oil shot up.
It came after a Food And Drug Administration (FDA) ruling mandating the labeling of trans fatty acids on the Nutrition Facts label and food manufacturers began eliminating trans fats from their products and substituting them with palm oil.
Wilmer’s imports to the United States alone increased by nearly 60 per cent. The increased use of biofuels at the expense of fossil fuels also contributed significantly to demand.
As a result, Lim’s wealth grew exponentially and the value of his investment in palm oil swelled.
My Indonesian partner was asking me the other day: How the hell did we make so much money?
Up to a point after people tell you a story and a vision, don’t write it off. Sometimes it comes true. You just make sure that if it doesn’t come true, you don’t get hurt too much.
– Peter Lim in an interview with The Business Times in 2007
In 2010, Lim cashed out his shares in Wilmer for US$1.5 billion — his first billion dollar fortune."

Peter Lim made his wealth through patient, long-term investing.
He does not like to trade – which is to buy one day and sell the next to lock in profits.
He said that “people who get rich are those who buy a company, build it, run it.”
It takes time for businesses to grow; they certainly do not flourish overnight.
He also did not worry about the short-term fluctuations of the stock market.
One time, the Singapore’s stock market took a sharp nosedive, wiping out more than $100 million of his stock’s value.
However, Lim was unruffled. Having been through many crashes and financial crises, he knew that things would turn out fine after all, and it did.
Interestingly, Lim got to where he is today through a mixture of savvy investing and sheer grit.
His story showed us that in order to succeed, we need to have the patience to grow a business instead of looking for short-term gains.

KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 17): FGV Holdings Bhd expects crude palm oil (CPO) to trade between RM2,500 and RM2,600 per tonne in the first half of next year (1H21), slightly lower than the average of about RM2,747 per tonne seen from June to date.
While FGV CEO Datuk Haris Fadzilah Hassan noted that the forward prices for the next six months until May 2021 are very strong, until reaching above RM3,000 per tonne, he said the group is sticking with its forecast range.
“We have our own views with regards to how the numbers will pan out, taking into account the issues of supply and weather conditions. It is a forecast that we are working on
18/11/2020 7:02 AM
This is normal...
He does not want to set too much expectation.
Next coming Fourth quarter Q4 results will be even better, viewing current CPO price is about to break at RM 3,500 level soon.

Privatisation coming at RM0.90 or RM0.95
Director bought warrant at 0.275 per share, conversion price is RM0.60
0.275 + 0.60= 0.875 which is much higher than the ordinary share price.
Just ask yourself, why director bought warrant at such high price with huge volume.
So, the story is privatization is coming.
Hooray......
The privatization price is definitely higher than RM0.875 so calculate yourself.
Harnlen is current a net cash company with more than RM160Million cash in hand.
NTA is RM1.23.

Hope for the best to come. RM0.90 coming d.....privatization coming,,,,,?
Harn Len Corp Bhd go go go.
Sell Jtiasa buy harnlen.
Harnlen's coming QR will be reporting super good profit. Furthermore, Harnlen's hotel just located 5 mins from the JB RTS site. So is very potential that Temasek Holdings Singapore will buy Harnlen's hotel. Then another round of disposal gain and special dividend.
Harnlen is the best."

We expect the oil palm division to perform well in view of the current uptrend in CPO prices due to low inventory level and higher demand from major consuming countries such as China and India in replenishing their dwindling stock.
For timber segment, the average prices for timber products remain stable due to global supplies constraint and we foresee gradual improvement in this division as economic activities start to normalise."

Wtk is an asset play
just like Kulim was an asset play
Calvin call for a buy on Kulim at only Rm2.50 when it was downtrending
J Corp took Kulim private at Rm4.10 for 60% upside
if you check Kulim last two quarters before delisting Kulim actually reported losses
Why then Jcorp wanted to private it?
Because Jcorp wanted to put Kulim under Johor Land (another company taken private which I also got)
There converted 2 strategic lands of Kulim into thriving housing enclaves. One near Desaru and one near Tg Berlungkar
Do you know how valuable are the assets of Wtk?
Wtk has Warehouse in Spore with dirt cheap book value

- Jayya Tiasa's 1Q FY21 core net profit of RM35m (1Q FY19 core net profit : RM16.8m) came in above expectations due to better-than- expected contribution from its plantation division.
- We raise our FY21/22E core earning forecasts by 126.4% / 37.1%, to mainly take into account higher plantation earnings given the higher CPO ASP assumptions.
-Our SOTP derived TP has also been raised to RM1. 32, we maintain our BUY rating on JAYA Tiasa.

mickey mouse now so confused?
India reduce palm oil tax by 10% to help soyoil?
what kind of flawed logic this Tikus brain came out with?
India reduce 10% tax for palm oil is to help consumers buying more cheaper palm oil lah
why must reduce?
because if India put too high a tax on palm oil the general population will suffer as their income has shrunk due to mco lock down in India
other reasons are
sunflower crop failure in black sea caused sky high prices for sunflower seed oil
India own soybean crop failure due to flood in maharastha
So with food inflation India has to reduce taxes for palm oil to help it's 1.4 billion citizens
Or else Food inflation in year 2010 caused Arab Spring might later cause India Spring due to soaring prices of food out of reach
So now you know palm oil will go into an unstoppable bull run"

11/17/2020
KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The world's largest producer of crude palm oil, Malaysia's FGV Holdings Bhd (FGV) , warned on Tuesday that its fourth-quarter output would be hit by uncertainties over the weather and curbs to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
The Malaysian benchmark has rallied 18% over the period from July to September and crude palm oil (CPO) is now trading at 3,327 ringgit ($810.57) per tonne on lower than expected production and tightening supply.
""We expect both fresh fruit bunches and crude palm oil production in 4Q FY2020 to be impacted by weather uncertainties and partial lockdown in Sabah,"" Haris Fadzilah Hassan, FGV's group chief executive, said in an exchange filing."

With the current CPO price RM3,500, lets forecast Dec result to maintain at RM35,000.
Mar 2021- RM35,000,
Jun 2021- RM35,000.
The whole year profit will be RM139,844,000. With the current share price 0.925, the PE ratio is only 6.44 which is definitely undervalued.
With the 8 years record high CPO price and Jtiasa average 11-year-old Prime tree, the more reasonable PE should be more than 10. PE 10 the share price should be 1.44 which still has a 56% uptrend.
Furthermore, Malaysia and Indonesia government already stop issuing Palm Oil license a few years ago. Hence, high opportunity the share price will touch 1.50 within H1 2021.
Good luck to all who's holding Jtiasa."

Chun chun called by sifu 'Calvin'
I just chatted with few customers who own palm estate. According to them main concern is not EITHER affected by output reduced ( production reduced by 20 - 40% lesser) or Rainning ( La Nina)

Brazil drought delayed planting in September 2020
soybean needs 100 days to grow till harvest
So in January 2021 there is very little soybean from South America
China will rush to buy up all US remaining soybean of this year
Other nations will also panic buy
Soybean prices will sustain and go higher
Then Cpo price will follow soybean up in tandem
We are at the beginning of a palm oil bull run
If South America faces drought from now till Feb 2021 then Palm oil will turn into a superbull
After South America next harvest of soybean will be in Sept 2021.
So can expect Palm oil superbull to last till 4th quarter of 2021
This bull has long way more up to go
And unlike face masks and gloves where everyone try to set up company from 2 months to 6 months there is a barrier to entry for palm oil
1. It takes at least 3 or 4 years to grow palm oil and see first harvest of Ffb
2. Malaysia and Indonesia stopped giving out license for new clearing of forest to plant palm oil (unlike face masks or gloves got no restriction )

Most traders have neglected the super bull run on CPO prices that will bring windfall profits to the Plantation companies. There are still many selling for a song, cheers.
CORRECT!!
FCPO CLOSED AT ABOVE RM3600 MEANS MORE THAN 100% PROFIT FOR ALL PALM OIL COMPANIES
FEB 2021 FANTASTIC RESULTS FOR ALL PALM OIL STOCKS WILL REGISTER HUGE PROFITS
WHY?
ANSWER:
OCTOBER, NOVEMBER & UNTIL DEC 10TH NOW CPO HAS FCPO HAS BEEN HOLDING FIRMLY ABOVE RM3400 TO RM3600
Let's calculate the Feb 2021 figure
October 30 days
November 30 days
December 31 days
Total days of last quarter for 2020 is 91 days
Today is 10th day of Dec
So 2 months & 10 days = 70 days
70/91 = 76.9% of the Feb 2021 results will reflect These Very High Profit months
Even if production of FFB decrease by 10% to 15% the Huge Increase in CPO prices over ride all to Excel
Conclusion:
PALM OIL NOW IN BULL RUN TREND"

（吉隆坡11日讯）由于大豆油价走高，及全球第二大棕油生产国大马的产量降幅超过预期，棕油价攀升至近8年的最高水平。
今天开盘后，大马棕油期货一度大涨1.2%至每吨3444令吉，触及近8年的新高。
截至今天下午6时，大马棕油期货每吨报3407令吉，全日升4令吉或0.12%。
大马棕油局（MPOB）最新数据显示，11月份的原棕油产量按月下降13.5%，至149万吨，这是自2010年以来最低水平。
11月棕油库存也跌至3年新低，而出口也按月下跌22.2%，至130万吨.
不过，大马棕油出口表现不佳，可能限制棕油价进一步上涨。"

2020年12月03日
（吉隆坡3日讯）2019年员工房屋、住宿和设施基本标准修正法令（446法令）是于2019年9月18日在宪报公布，执行期于2020年5月27日，设有3个月宽限期至今年9月才全面落实，法令于今年12月1日生效。
人力资源部已在全国展开检举行动，确保我国消除劳力市场中的强迫劳役与贩运人口元素。
根据446法令，凡是有提供员工宿舍设备的雇主，必须向劳工局申请住宿认证，官员检查宿舍认为合规格后，才会发出认证。
该法令列明，雇主准备的员工宿舍的最低标准为每名员工的有盖空间为4.5平方公尺，或睡觉或休息空间不少于3平方公尺。一个800平方米单位的宿舍，只适合让最多6名员工居住。
大马半岛劳工局总监阿斯里之前就说，一些领域不乏优质管理的员工宿舍，贺特佳手套厂就拥有最佳员工宿舍，种植业则是森那美种植，电子与电器领域是晶片制造商英特尔。

EVERY YEAR THERE IS ONE OR TWO THEMATIC BULL THEME
IF WE CAN CATCH IT EARLY & RIDE THE BULL TO ITS PEAK WE WILL DO EXCEEDINGLY WELL
WE WILL BE ABLE TO OUTPERFORM IN A FEW SHORT BULL RUNS AND PERHAPS RETIRE EARLY LIKE PETER LYNCH
OF COURSE LIKE WARREN BUFFET MAKING MONEY FROM STOCK MARKET AS A MOTIVE IS LONG OVER
IT IS THE JOY, THE ADVENTURE & THE CONSTANT INTELLECTUAL CHALLENGE IN THE ART OF INVESTMENTS THAT CAUSED HIM TO SAY
""TAP DANCING TO WORK""
NOW MY HUMBLE OPINION IS THIS
YEAR 2021 WILL BE PALM OIL ""BULL RUN""
WHY PALM OIL WILL GO INTO A BULL RUN FOR YEAR 2021?
ANSWER:
BECAUSE CPO PRICES NOW REACHING ALL TIME HIGH WILL AMPLIFY PROFITS
AND IF PROFITS KEEP INCREASING IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME COMPANIES WILL INCREASE DIVIDENDS OR REWARD WITH BONUS ISSUES. SO PALM OIL SHARES MUST GO UP AS THIS IS THE LAW!
SOYBEAN OIL GETTING MORE EXPENSIVE PEOPLE WILL GO FOR PALM OIL!! & PALM OIL WILL RISE IN TANDEM
AGAIN WHEN ALL THE WORLD MARKETS CLOSED FOR CHRISTMAS FRIDAY - CHINA BEING COMMUNIST STILL TRADE IN DALIAN ALREADY RECORD HIGH FOR BOTH PALMOIL & SOYABEAN MAH...!!
U r actually seeing emerging sign of palmoil share run like the early Gloves run in March to April Rally coming which are very subtle upside b4 it explosively burst out with gains of few hundred % coming at the later stage mah...!!

in year 2014 Jtiasa was Rm2.70 when Cpo was less than Rm3000 per ton
Now that Cpo has reached Rm3,880 per ton Jtiasa still below 90 sen?
Really amazing value
All 90% go chase stocks with lesser earnings
and some even with no earnings
This is the reason why we KNOW 90% GOING TO LOSE MONEY OR AT BEST BREAK EVEN WHILE ONLY 10% WILL EVENTUALLY MAKE MONEY
SO HAPPY INDEED

Haha see see loh :
From the above information, compute the cost of production CPO per MT and PK per tonne. By using the four methods of cost of production for PK, the result are as follow :
1. Net market value or net realizable value.
This method stipulated that the cost of production of PK is RM 1,794.75/MT, it’s mean that the cost of production equal to sales price or market value, then it can be used as the contra account or credit for CPO cost of production in the income statement. Actually, it can’t be accepted as cost of production of PK as well, because of there is gross profit or loss inside.
And the cost of CPO is RM 1,903.40/MT (RM 5,710,198.22 : 3.000 MT). Here, the cost of CPO and PK have not so significant diffference (RM 1,903.40/MT vs RM 1,794.75/MT), and of cource couldn’t be used as the reason to decide that PK as by-product.

11-Jan-2021 04:14:12 PM
KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 11 (Bernama) -- The Ministry of Plantation Industries and Commodities (KPPK) has given an assurance that oil palm plantations will be given permission to operate as usual if the government implements the Movement Control Order (MCO) 2.0.
Minister Datuk Dr Mohd Khairuddin Aman Razali said this was important to ensure that palm oil production was not interrupted and the country could continue its commodity exports to the rest of the world.
""We have gone through the MCO 1.0 phase in March 2020 and today we have been through it for almost one year. Of course, we have learned the best way for us to manage the plantations more prudently.
""Besides that, workers in oil palm plantations have always practised social distancing and their jobs require them to distance themselves. Hence, the spread of COVID-19 can be avoided,"" he told a press conference in conjunction with the Palm Oil Economic Review & Outlook (R&O) today.
Mohd Khairuddin said his ministry was optimistic that the palm oil trade performance would be better this year due to the positive forecast of the country's economy, as well as productivity, which is expected to increase due to good agricultural practices that formed the basis of the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MPSO) certification scheme.
He said as at Dec 31, 2020, a total of 5.2 million hectares or 88.25 per cent of the 5.9 million hectares under oil palm cultivation in Malaysia have obtained the MSPO certificates.
A total of 434 mills or 96.02 per cent of the 452 palm oil mills have also obtained the MSPO certificates.
Meanwhile, he said Malaysia has decided to file legal action with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) against the European Union's (EU) restrictions on palm oil-based biofuel"

Probably he is not happy because Sifu Calvin bcos Sifu Calvin wants to help investors like you and me. Noting that fact, shares go up and down due to weather, politics and etc ..... even though they have the fundamentals. So i hope we will continue to hold our shares and just wait for it to go up as Sifu Calvin has given a clear picture about Jtiasa. Sifu Calvin we miss your positive postings and please come back soon to continue to give us semangat. Tqvvm Sifu Calvin.
By the way i have nothing personal against Mikecyc but i NEVER read any of his post because a person like me who don't know much about shares also can see the evil posting by him. So investors just go investing in JTIASA and forget about Mikecyc."

South America Weather Radar shows Argentina very dry
Soybean and Corn will be fair in Brazil but quite bad in Argentina
that means that Soyoil will be sustained
Thus palm oil should be well supported above Rm3000
Production is as low as Rm1465 by Thplant
and No tax of 8% if cpo prices falls below Rm3450
So most Palm oil companies will enjoy 100% net profit for 2021
Glove ASP now at its apex and will plateaued off and also Glove prices up alot from it's lows
Tech stocks surged very very high but got only average earnings
So P/E now very high
Only palm oil stocks got real and solid earnings for 2021 and prices still low
So go for palm oil shares while others chase bubbles"

The LPF holders failing to complete the new tree planting plan by 2025 may have the unplanted areas taken back by the state authorities for re-issuance of new LPFs to potential investors.
These new rulings are part of the “Revised policy direction on industrial forest plantation in Sarawak” from the state Urban Development and Natural Resources Ministry. Details of the revised policy are published in the latest issue of Perkasa, a quarterly newsletter of the Sarawak Timber Industry Development Corp (STIDC).
Since 1997, the Sarawak Forest Department has issued 43 LPFs covering a gross area of 2.3 million ha, out of which only a net area of 1.3 million ha are plantable. A large portion of the LPF’s area has to be excluded for protection functions.
According to the department, the bulk of the LPFs are located in Sarawak’s central and northern regions.
Under the Forests (Planted Forests) Rules 1997, the state government has permitted the LPF holders to plant oil palm covering 20% of the plantable area for one cycle of 25 years to allow flexibility in their cash flow management.
Planted forests have a long gestation period of 12 to 15 years before the trees are matured for commercial harvesting, according to one of the LPF holders, Jaya Tiasa Holdings Bhd."

For commodities companies (whether minerals or agricultural/woods), once the market prices of these commodities keep going up for sustainable periods, and with same costs of productions, profitability will shoot up. With this, their share prices will increase.
If you look at Metals X Ltd (Australian listed co., strong in copper mining), when copper price was very low early last year, the share price went down to A$0.12 and now, AS0.24. You see, 100% increase.

5.星纸没有什么好报告棕榈油股的个人表现

6.政府希望Felda接管Fgv既得利益，才能看到Fgv价格受到压制，因此其他棕榈油股也被禁止上涨
7.大多数大师不赞成棕榈油，而是追逐手套，高科技和其他钢铁/铝库存
8.集团希望拥有较少实收资本的股票易于抽出并倾倒于下注者和傻瓜
而且，市场而不是投资可以快速买入价值不高的劣质快速淘汰劣质股票
9，大多数人看到棕榈油不动不动
10.因此，棕榈油公司赚了很多钱，但股票仍然不动，一些人濒临放弃的失望

1. Countries with competing vegetable oils oppose palm oil
2. Foreign media like curls are not suitable for palm oil
3. The local dirty ib bankers do not approve of the use of palm oil for some reason, because they have issued too many palm oil subscription warrants
4. Local media like edgedaily do not approve of the use of palm oil. Always emphasize negative factors more than positive factors
5. Star Paper has nothing to report on the personal performance of palm oil stocks
Star paper should be called snake skin paper
6. The government hopes that Felda will take over the vested interests of Fgv to see that Fgv prices are suppressed, so other palm oil stocks are also prohibited from rising
7. Most masters do not approve of palm oil, but chase gloves, high-tech and other steel/aluminum stocks
8. The group hopes that stocks with less paid-in capital are easy to withdraw and dumped on punters and fools
Moreover, the market instead of investment can quickly buy low-quality low-quality stocks and quickly eliminate low-quality stocks
9. Most people see palm oil motionless
10. Therefore, palm oil companies have made a lot of money, but the stocks are still not moving, and some people are on the verge of giving up disappointment
It is people who are so afraid that we should buy palm oil stocks
Because they are so cheap, they are the best choice for happy real investors.

尊敬的i3论坛投资者/交易者，
今天，我们很高兴与您分享投资种植园股票特别是棕榈油带来的巨大好处.。
这些是特优的因素：-
1）棕榈油在所有超级市场商品中占50％
从面包到饼干；牙膏涂口红；从食用油到冰淇淋；从护发霜到洗发水。棕榈油无处不在
想一想没有棕榈油的超市货架会有多空
因此棕榈油已成为一种生命之源
2）棕榈油是地球上最经济的素食油
比大豆，玉米，花生，葵花籽或橄榄油需要更少的土地来生产更多的油
所有其他人将占用更多的土地和劳动力，并将以更高的价格出售。
所以棕榈油有很长的期限
3）棕榈油用途广泛
它可以用作食物，也可以转化为能源
尤其是现在的Biodisel能源正在像大豆，乙醇，大豆，玉米和糖这样的绿色能源被推广
看到乙醇作为燃料仅需每加仑2.31美元（右边是普通汽油，每加仑2.86美元）
玉米，大豆和糖的需求量很大，因为乙醇棕榈油也将成为生物柴油的需求量
4）Joe Biden正在致力于绿色能源
由于棕榈油生物柴油不含硫，因此它是碳中性的

2021年3月3日-拜登的恢复计划对清洁能源寄予厚望...与应对气候危机息息相关-代表着民主党人在奥巴马政府执政期间的主要行动，气候变化已成为核心问题。 ...“考虑通过基础设施解决气候变化本身并不是一个....
5）世界人口不断增加的同时
耕地越来越少
因此存在长期需求，但稀缺性将推动价格上涨
需求法则不仅仅取决于价格波动，还会导致价格上涨或通胀
所以棕榈油是通货膨胀的对冲
6）棕榈油不只是土地储备，它是一项业务，因为它是一种现金农作物
从棕榈油中赚取的现金作物现金可以作为股息
Mhc Plant刚派了5％的股息
ThPlant在景气时期发放了高额股息和红利
TDM使用其剩余现金投资了4家医院，就像Kulim投资了KPJ Hospitals
7）土地永远存在：棕榈油公司很少会像石油和天然气公司一样破产
O＆G公司的oil rigs assets 资产会生锈且毫无用处。因此Swibor，Hin Leong，Sumatec，Perisai破产了
但是，正当kulim在2.60令吉时，它被私有化在4.10令吉。然而，TMakmur在1.38令吉被私有化在1.80令吉，后来又提高到1.90令吉。 50仙的Kwantas令人惊讶。突然私有化的消息以1.65马币的好价格。
很久以前，Golden Hope Plant，Austral Enterprizes和其他的也被私有化。
因此，投资棕榈油股票是非常安全的，因为其土地保留了长期剩余价值
土地？
是永远的土地
看
Berean Study 圣经
世代相传，世代相传，但地球永远存在。
King James圣经
一代人离世，另一代人来世；但地球永远存在。
New American Standard 圣经
一代人过去，一代人来临，但是地球永远存在。
Mark Twain说，
“为他们买土地，别无所求”
8）是的，最主要的开发商向种植园主购买土地
很久以前，柔佛州的所有的发展商都从Kulim购买了土地
而Kulim的座右铭如下：
Buy Land, they're not making it anymore.
最后，Kulim成为柔佛州最大的土地拥有者。
屋子发展商，例如KSL，DAIMAN，CRESCENDO，PLENITUDE和其他的，都从（Kulim）买土地来建房，商店，工厂和购物商场等。
因此，棕榈油和土地是可以转移到具有附加价值的资产中
IOI Puchong将Rubber Estate转换为IOI MALL
Genting Plant将其棕榈油地打造为柔佛名牌城 （JPO）
9）ECRL铁路建设从Tumpat Kedah到KLANG港口，和Pan Borneo高速公路从砂拉越州到沙巴州的计划，将开启前所未有土地的价值增值。
因此，在更长的时间内对棕榈油进行投资将是非常值得的
是的
Robert Kuok的Wilmar让他成为马来西亚的首富
这是总所周知的
但最大的惊喜是比尔·盖茨
比尔·盖茨现在是美国最大的农田持有者
比尔·盖茨可能不再是世界首富，但他可以冠以新的头衔：美国的农田之王。
一份新的报告说，这位亿万富翁微软联合创始人通过悄悄购买全县的大片土地，已成为美国农田的最大所有者。
根据土地报告杂志《土地报告》，盖茨的投资组合包括19个州的约242,000英亩农田和近27,000英亩其他土地，该杂志追踪了美国最大的土地所有者。
比尔·盖茨（Bill Gates）提前意识到了互联网的需求
他的愿景是每个家庭中都会有电脑
但是比尔盖茨在整个美国购买农耕地的大片土地？
他还能看到多少东西？
对于那些现在可以“看到”的机会，可以通过FGV，THPLANT，JTIASA，BPLANT，HSPLANT，WTK，TDM，CHINTECK和其他许多公司通过上市公司购买棕榈油股份以拥有土地

U can emulate them now too mah....!!
Thats why the 2 richest savvy investors have taken note the point of concern that palmoil & commodity price cannot going up forever like the case of glove & eventually the commodity price will also fall 1 day mah!
To address this issue or concern w.buffet & bill gates, say buy farmland & palmoil plantation, even the commodity price fall, u still have great protection on the value of cheap plantation land & farmland mah..!
If u buy into cheap land, u have both margin of safety accorded by cheap land plus prospect of reaping great profit from high palmoil price loh!
Thus u should Quickly Buy into palmoil plantation now, b4 its price shoot up mah!
Time to be a little bit more contraian in view of mkt at reasonable high level mah!
Warren buffet says inflation is definitely coming in view of low interest interest and speculative sign such as bitcoin, rubbish stock price run up sky high and unrealistic stock valuation & expectation and now raw commodities price run up mah!
Bill Gates already bought alot of farmland at low in preparation & in anticipation for the coming armmagedoom coming mah!
Why would one the world tech best richest owner switch alot of his investment into farmland, this bcos farmland or value real estate if it is bought at reasonable low price, u cannot go wrong over longterm bcos the availability of land is limited, u cannot manufacture land like bitcoin mah!
Coming back to msia the equivalent to farmland is oil plantation, u still can get it real cheap & it is paying u reasonably good dividend loh...this is the best defensive & offensive play like bill gates and warren buffet had highlighted mah!
As calvin sifu said timber is at record price & palmoil at record price surely some optimism will spillover to plantation & timber share price mah!
But this up 1 to 2 sen is chicken feed mah, why up so little leh ??
Timber & palmoil share r suffering from lack of production mah and also huge impairment losses on its assets mah & previous falling share price mah!
Thus they are jittery on recovery of palmoil & timber share loh!! They want to see actual profit b4 jump in loh!!
That means if u base on profit...as indicator that means the share price will be lagging loh!
Then why promote Wtk leh ??
1. The owner , directors and insiders already accumulating quietly without fanfare mah!
2. The palmoil & timber production volume of wtk, mhc, jtiasa, boustead, ijm plant already creeping up loh...this is further support by the record price of its commodities. Just imagine u have higher prices & higher volume....that will be a very important sign of higher big profit coming mah!
3. The share price already corrected over 3 yrs of downtrend previously, when there is a big shakeout of all the weak holders...u can only grow more optimistic as time past by loh!
4. Wtk is sitting on some prime land that invested at a very low cost near major town & city, they are good development mah!
5. With all the liquidity & quantitative easing & low interest rate environment, u can see big inflation will be coming loh...!! Wtk in commodities business plus very big cheap land bank is a very good inflation protector mah!
Based on the above i think wtk , jayatiasa & ijmplant is the best pick to make profit & this is concur by sifu calvin findings also mah!

Calvin and Ahbah , Investment timing is very important and be at least medium and long term horizon . Dont buy at the peak . Gloves stocks had came down 50 to 60 % from the peaks in August last year . I did not promote glove counters then because the earnings were still not proven , PE were high . Glove stock prices peak before its ASP peak . There was a 9 months to a year lead of the share prices over its ASPs . Glove stocks had finally PROVEN to deliver fantastic results in the last 3 qtrs after August 2020 while their prices came down 50 % . THeir PE are less than 5 while they will continue to deliver superb results in the next few years with double and tripling of capacities . The palm oil price cannot keep going up forever since it started picking up 2 years ago in 2019 .Likewise , the oil palm counters will peak soon or already peak now before its palm oil ASP peak which may happen in 3 to 6 months time or even earlier . When palm oils ASP came down finally , do the plantation counters have doubling of capacities to compensate for the drop in ASPs ?"

Buying interest continued to pick up over the past six days and we expect the FCPO to rebound, leading to further recovery soon.
Mabel expect FCPO consolidation is about to end...Uptrend still intact...

大马棕油期货合约本周预计将出现套利潮，而导致价格下跌。
Interband集团高级棕油交易员郑锦（译音）指出，由于其他国家的需求低，而大马和印尼的库存仍然很高。
“未来几个月没有什么重大节日，我们预计交易将出现下跌趋势以及需求放缓，这将导致棕油价格下跌。”
“因此，期货合约很可能交易在每吨3100到3200令吉之间。”
在上周，市场普遍收低，主要是跟随美国芝加哥期货交易所（CBOT）和大连商品交易所大豆油的疲软走势。
按周来看，7月棕油期货走跌165令吉，至每吨3549令吉，8月则报每吨3441令吉，按周少222令吉。

惠誉评级在报告中指，也预见来自原棕油替代品，和印尼所提议的削减出口税的压力。
大马基准原棕油现货价格，自今年5月每吨约1150美元（约4792令吉），降至6月的每吨约850美元（约3542令吉）。
然而，我国的产量仍低于正常水平，主要是冠病疫情的管控令限制，导致外劳短缺。
惠誉评级预计，我国政府会采取措施，改善油棕园的人力供应，但进展缓慢可能会抑制原棕油产量，从而支撑原棕油价格。"

Drought is a threat to corn and soybeans in the upper Midwest. Three-fourths of Iowa, which is No. 1 in corn and No. 2 in soybeans, is in “moderate” or “severe” drought at present. Weather in July and August is key to crop yields.
“It’s becoming more likely that weather might be just good enough for corn and soybeans to produce about an average crop,” said Ray Grabowski of Progressive Ag Marketing.
July is forecast to be hotter than usual in most of the Midwest, as well as the West, New England, and the mid-Atlantic states, said the National Weather Service in a 30-day forecast issued on Wednesday. Rainfall during July was forecast to be below normal in the Pacific Northwest, the northern Plains, Minnesota, and most of Iowa and Wisconsin.
The USDA says the margin of error for its estimates of corn plantings is 1.8% and 3% for soybeans. The Acreage report tends to overstate corn plantings and underplay soybean acreage.
Also on Wednesday, the USDA’s quarterly Grain Stocks report said, as expected, that less corn, soybeans and wheat was being held in U.S. grain bins than on June 1 a year ago. The soybean stockpile fell 44%, and wheat and corn stockpiles were down 18% each."

Very ok
Jtiasa people say two factors
1) Lack of fruit harvesters due to MCO
2) Recent Flooding
59,000 tonnes very OK as CPO prices of April, May & June 2021 ranged from Rm3500 to Rm4800 (Last time was Rm2000 to Rm2200)
SO VERY OK FROM HERE AS JTIASA JTIASA PRICED IN BELOW 60 SEN (NOT RM1.00)

REAL MOTIVES OF INSIDER IS BUYING
A potential indicator of a stock’s future performance is the level of stock that insiders are buying.
In this context, an insider is an employee of the company, usually, a high-level executive (e.g. CEO, CFO, COO) or it can be a hedge fund that is providing capital.
Their access to non-public information puts more weight on their buying and selling decisions. With that in mind, it’s important to note that insiders may sell shares of stock for many reasons. However, they only buy for one reason.
That is, they believe that information is going to be released that will boost the stock price in the near future.
Or , the next step is to take the company into serious consideration for private exercise.

So he tracked my stock history
See carefully

Listen & see
If everyone will not cherry pick but commit Rm10K to each & every stock he listed
The sum total gain less sum total loss is still positive
Some like Supermax up from Rm1.73 to Rm24.44 peak are up 1,000% in its cycle
The maximum loss or total loss is 100% but many have gained 100% to 200%
So if one can gain 1,000% it can cover 10 total loss = 1,000%
But so far none has gone bankrupt
Even though those down like Opcom has now come back to life"

Today Dutaland is 38 sen
So from 39.5 sen to 38 sen price has gone down by 1.5 sen only
But please SEE carefully the cash dividend paid out
16-Jun-2021 05-Jul-2021 DIVIDEND Interim Dividend RM 0.0100 Dividend Detail
06-Oct-2020 11-Nov-2020 DIVIDEND First and Final Dividend RM 0.0100 Dividend Detail
15-Apr-2019 26-Apr-2019 DIVIDEND Special Dividend RM 0.05 Dividend Detail
30-May-2018 12-Jun-2018 DIVIDEND Special Dividend RM 0.05
From years 2018 to 2021 Dutaland paid out at total dividends of 12 sen (5 sen + 5 sen + 1 sen + 1 sen)
So all who bought at 39.5 sen have received a total cash paid out of 12 sen
Real time value of Dutaland is 39.5 sen + 12 sen = 51.5 sen
These are real life figures which everyone can check & verify
Now if you have bought Dutaland at 39.5 sen in year 2016 & held on till now
There is still a yield of 2.4 sen per year average (12 sen divides by 5 years = 2.4 sen a year)
That is still a decent 6% yield or 30% total for 5 years
Now please don't blame Calvin if you chased high & lost some
Of course Calvin does not recommend buying Dutaland as it had Sold all its Sabah Oil Palm Lands to Bplant (GO BUY BPLANT IF YOU WISH)
To be continued.... with T7 Global explanation later
AND TO ALL DEAR FRIENDS WHO READ WITH OPEN MIND AND HEART
PLEASE DO YOUR OWN DUE DILIGENCE
BEFORE BUYING & SELLING
THANK YOU
Calvin"

This week is the final lapse for Sept 2021 before the month is done.
By then we will witness another 3 solid months (July, August & September) of 2021 with Cpo prices ranging from Rm4,000 to Rm4,600 a ton
Very excellent results could be in store for all oil palm companies by November 2021 only 2 months away!
Not hope for or hope so....but a solid reality
Let's expect more
1) Higher dividends
2) Special dividends
3) Free Bonus Issues
4) Free warrants
5) A possible windfall surprise take-over like KLK taking over IjmPlant at Rm3.10 from Rm2.20
So just hold on to your precious oil palm shares
Good things are in store for all happy holders
Warm regards

1) 未来财富
2）现在的财富
3) 过去的财富
未来、现在和过去的财富？ 这些是什么？
让我举例说明
1) 未来财富由一名刚从学校毕业的年轻毕业生代表。 通常是二十多岁的年轻人。
他还年轻，还没有买自己的房子。 他可能拥有一辆负担得起的汽车或一辆摩托车。
他得到了什么？ 他有希望。 他对成功充满决心，充满想法！！ 但他还没有赚到任何真正的钱。 他的财富还在未来！
这是一家非常年轻的公司的代表。 管理充满了想法、风险和合并。 充满活力和希望。 IPO期间热情高涨。 看看有多少人写文章来宣传这家新上市的公司。 轻信的人在追逐。 但该股票尚未经过测试。 业务尚未证明自己。 对财富的所有炒作和希望仍在未来！
卡尔文很少投资这种类型的公司。 最好避免。
为什么要避免？
看到这个
大多数初创企业在头五年都失败了，神话还是现实？
事实证明，对于商界的大多数企业家来说，开办新企业是一项艰巨的任务。 企业运营的前五年内的失败率仍然存在争议，据说一个经济区与另一个经济区不同。 据说这取决于在不同行业中运作的各种内部和外部环境力量。 根据 Griffith (2014) 的说法，他假设超过 60% 到 70% 的初创企业无法生存超过前五年。
是的！ 超过 50% 的新业务将在第一个五年内失败
这就是为什么卡尔文通常会避免购买未经证实的新股票。 我需要在上市后至少 3 年才能在购买之前阅读其年度年度报告。 或者等待或给它一个通行证。
在现实生活中，已建立的公司只会寻找具有经证实的经验和技能的合格工人，并从他以前的公司中获得真实的业绩或良好的业绩证明。 他们不会根据您的要求雇用您。 他们只聘用技能和资格证明的结果"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000681.jsp?ftp=173","Oct 2, 2021 12:28 PM","vincent555","现财富。 由收入证明的成长型公司代表。 通常健康的 PRESENT 增长是可见的。 这就像一个30多岁到40多岁的成熟男人。 他买了房子和汽车。 但他的大部分资金仍然投资于他不断增长的业务。
所以他的财富现在还在产生。
这是受欢迎的成长股。
所以我避免购买炒作“未来增长”的股票。 如果我看到价值，则有选择地购买当前成长型股票。 并且喜欢以超低折扣购买过去价值巨大的财富股票
我避开希望未来财富的年轻人。 如果它们以合理的价格出售，我将购买一些（仅选择性地）现有财富的成熟公司。 我专注于过去累积财富以大幅折扣出售的高价值股票
补充评论：
现在有一个最好的新想法
购买拥有过去财富、现在财富和未来财富的公司：最佳组合的三合一公式
我们在哪里可以找到这个？
卡尔文会买一些。 在一个条件下。 他寻找一个公平的价格进入。 最好是在市场崩盘期间或被市场忽视。
但是当价格被高估时，卡尔文不会为他们付出高昂的代价。 如果您为任何事情多付了钱。 在未来很长一段时间内，它们很可能会跑输市场。
过去的财富。
这是一个50多岁、60多岁、70多岁甚至80多岁的老熟人
他曾经是 Vision 的一名年轻毕业生。 在他的鼎盛时期，他成为了一名非常成功的商人。 因此，他用自己的收入购买了大量资产，例如土地、房产、仓库、店屋和其他有价值的投资。 现金或收益转化为真正的优质资产——如此高的 NTA 反映在账面价值中。
由于他已经老了，他的脚步放慢了。 他承担的风险较小。 他着眼于增长，首先寻找保本。 但通常情况会更稳定，因为他不再像刚毕业时那样饥饿。"

刚发现
油棕公司
大多数油棕公司都有过去的财富
多年来，他们以很久以前的低价购买土地。 现在他们真的坐在金矿上
以 Bplant 为例。 它刚刚以 6200 万令吉的账面价值以 4.28 亿令吉的价格出售了油棕地，获得了 690% 的收益/并且 Bplant 的真实情况在 Thplant、Jtiasa、Fgv、SOP、Taann、Tsh Resources 也是如此 - 所有这些都拥有超过 200,000 英亩的高度 宝贵的油棕庄园，加上一些棕榈油厂和精炼厂、各种多元化企业、森林特许土地和通过多年积累获得的其他有价值资产。
现在 Cpo 的价格已经超过了 Rm4,700，现在的财富
去年原棕油价格低至每吨 2,200 令吉。 所以现在的财富增加了100%"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000681.jsp?ftp=173","Oct 2, 2021 12:29 PM","vincent555","油棕有未来的财富
1) 作为食物
50% 的超市产品都使用棕榈油
2) 作为绿色能源
世界正越来越多地转向绿色能源。 从化石燃料到生物燃料
在 2021 年 11 月，我们可以期待看到所有油棕公司的惊人业绩，因为收益是真实的（现在！不是未来的炒作）
所以有过去的财富，现在的财富和未来的财富：
还有一个。
永恒的财富
耶稣说：“人若赚得全世界，赔上自己的灵魂，又有什么益处呢？人拿什么换来自己的灵魂呢？”
换句话说，今生的财富只是暂时的，但来世更为重要——因为今生是永恒的。"

Bloomberg : U.S. Soybean Meal Export Hub Damage May Take Months to Fix
By Kim Chipman September 25, 2021, 5:33 AM GMT+8 Updated on September 25
The disruption puts yet another kink in global supply chains with the U.S. still reeling from the export chaos caused by Hurricane Ida in the Gulf of Mexico, home of America’s busiest agricultural port. The terminal in Grays Harbor handles the bulk of America’s soy meal shipped to Asia from the West Coast.
Supply tightness in soybean oil market making ways for sunflower oil
in Dry Bulk Market,International Shipping News 04/10/2021
The sudden rise in demand for biofuels is causing supply tightness in the soybean oil market, which is likely to persist until 2022. Alternatives such as sunflower oil will benefit from this situation.
... This supply tightness is likely to continue as Brazil’s soybean oil production is expected to be lower in 2021 than 2020. The country’s blending mandate will also increase from 10% to 13% in November 2021. Argentina, the biggest exporter of soybean oil, is also expected to lower its exports until 2022 on accounts of higher biodiesel use. The domestic consumption of soybean oil is expected to increase by 1.8 million tonnes in the crop year 2021-22 to 61.4 million tonnes compared to the previous year.

Offensive
1. benefit from high oil price reap huge profit improvement, strong cash flow generation and strong and healthy balance sheet
2. Strong dividend will be forthcoming.
3. The govt of indonesia & msia have restricted new palmoil plantation development thus limited future plantation supply in the future which is good as it will lend support to its price loh!
Defensive
1. Land has a finite supply which is a good hedge against inflation
2. Currently plantation trade at a deep undervalue thus give big margin of safety for investor loh!

1. RM to USD is > RM4.15++
(Oil palm export proceeds in USD will bring back more RM to their kitty).
2. Good CPO price > RM4.5K/ton to RM5.0K/ton ++.
(Same efforts, but selling at extremely good prices. Laughing all the way to the bank).
3. Most raw materials & costs of productions are sourced locally in RM including fertilizers as
Malaysia has a strong resource-based economies as Malaysia has been in oil palm industry
business for more than 50-60 years and so almost everything is local.
4. Upstream oil palm business is simple & no need for a Rocket Scientist to teach. Follow the
basics, follow SOp & get them right.
5. For gold, steel, etc, closing stocks are based on purchasers from suppliers of them.
(So, you realize when the gold, steels, etc are very high in prices, high profits are reported &
when their closing stocks are high - Quantity x Closing Stock Price Valuation).
6. For oil palm estates, the closing stocks are on the trees & keep on harvesting from its own
sources (oil palm estates), so no need to buy unless you are skewed more towards CPO
extraction milling & trading. Keep producing, harvesting & get more values from the trees.
7. So, for the same efforts, for the same marginal increase in costs (fertilisers & labour), the
operating profits generated as explained in above are 1.5 fold,2 folds, 2.5 folds, etc.
8. I sit comfortable with my simple business model analysis with oil palm industry & the oil palm
companies I invest in for long term (LT) & know that I will reap from my patience & be rewarded."

3. There is quarterly reporting of oil palm listed companies in Bursa.
4. So, in the oil palm industry for listed oil palm companies, there is
nothing more transparent than these.
5. No need to listen to this or that, got projects or got this or that.
6. You can actually tabulate the above (No. 1 & No. 2 and do your own

If those plants are still there and maintained, when the timber session business recovers, that will boost the operating cash flow further

Between the Fye 2012, and 2020, Jtiasa prime and mature oil palm plantation has grown by 85% (from 37,419 to 69,589 hectares) while reafforested area has increased by 37% (from 30818 to 42254 hectares). The number of oil palm mills has also increased from 1 to 4 mills.
The growth of Jtiasa assets was thru internal generated funds as the Bank borrowing and total liablities have declined by 27% (880 mil to 643mil) and 35% (1,232 mil to 803 mil) respectively between Jun 2012 and Jun 2021. There was no need for share placement or right issues.
Despite the general view that Jtiasa assets could be more efficiently managed and poor corporate governance but, the above numbers show that there is so much value created thru internal generated funds for the past decade.
The company is in a enviable position to ride on the commodities boom.
Also, reafforestation is a very strategic investment which has a gestation period of 12 to 15 years. Jtiasa is now at the 10th to 12th year of reafforestation.
And the share price is just a fraction of what it was in 2012.
I don't know about you guys but I am looking forward for share price to drop further so that I can buy more"

1. FCPO is still all time high (As at 09-11-21, CPO Price is 4,792.00/ton).
2. Yes, FCPO drops because if it is too high, international buyers slow down a bit, but pick up later.
(CPO > 3,500/ton is a boom to oil palm upstream cos as well as downstream cos - both win)
3. Average CPO Price for Jul' to Sept'21 is 4,417/ton.
4. Average CPO Price for Oct'21 is 5,051/ton.
5. Now, announcing soon is the Value of FFB/CPO produced for Oct'21.
6. And, announcing soon is the Qtr Financial Report (Jul' to Sept'21).
7. So, we still have all the above favorable news.
8. So, lari dari apa? dari ular kah? No ular lah? But, ada factual figures lah.

Makingg quick is fun, fei zai
A agree. There is a lot of fun making $1,000 one day, $4,000 next day, $10,000 the next etc. Those are good news.
The fun stops and pain comes when suddenly you lose $50,000 in a morning.
The pain grows when next you try to make back the losses, but instead, lose another $100,000.
Those are bad news. Unfortunately, that is closer to reality.

The 2nd quarter result ending December 21 will be much better if the current record high prices can sustain till year end. It's a no brainer. Anything above their cost of production at say RM 1,700 - 1,750 assuming they are less efficient is pure profit. The debts will also be paid off faster when more free cash flow is available resulting in less interest payment going forward. CPO prices are experiencing a cyclical boom based on a myriad of factors. Just be patient and the good results will give the share price a lift. Happy trading guys."

It is true the Plantation companies share prices do not move and reflect the improved earnings. When we invest, we should buy at a good price relative to its intrinsic value and earnings which may not be accorded equal rating by investors yet. Nevertheless, when better dividends are paid or in some other Plantation companies higher dividends are paid to reward the shareholders, these will eventually provide a lift to share prices. If one is only interested or obsessed in prices going up regardless of the fundamentals and over-valuation, I suggest the Technology sector companies which are in vogue currently, cheers."

IOI's plantation results were solid, +50% operating margin. Most of their CPO is sold as feedstock to their downstream segments, which cannot pass on the increased feedstock prices to buyers, hence profitability was dragged by the downstream.
What was JTIASA's operating margin (palm oil only)? Less than 30%. That tells you all you need to know about their ability to manage palm oil estates. I've said it before, they need to sweat their assets more.
JTIASA missed the golden opportunity of once in a lifetime bull CPO market. Every other planter that is semi competent at running their plantations is reporting 2x - 3x profit. This joker can barely sustain y-o-y performance. Thats all."

We are dealing with an industry that feed 8 billion people across the planet.
The global market for Palm Oil estimated at US$42.8 Billion in the year 2020, is projected to reach a revised size of US$57.2 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 5% over the analysis period. Palm oil is a very productive crop. It offers a far greater yield at a lower cost of production than other vegetable oils. Global production of and demand for palm oil is increasing rapidly
The global production of palm oil was around 75 million metric tons in the marketing year 2020/21, at par from approximately 76 million metric tons in 2019/2020. In that period, Indonesia and Malaysia were the leading exporters of palm oil worldwide. Indonesia accounted for 57% of this (43 million tonnes), and Malaysia produced 27% (22 million tonnes).
The biggest consumers of palm oil are India, the European Union, and China, with the three consuming nearly 50% of world exports.
Palm Oil yields 4-10 times more oil per hectare than other sources of vegetable oil such as soybeans or coconut palms. This makes it an efficient and profitable use of land. The economic value of palm oil translates into jobs, infrastructure and tax revenues. The palm oil yield per hectare is estimated at 8 tons per year at most. Additionally, the profit farmers make per hectare is around 3.4 tons per year. So it’s a good business if managed properly..

Contraian Investor will enjoy good earnings & strong dividends which is the main basic fundamental of all investment in share mah!
Just think logically lah....u actually invest in stock for income mah....not really invest bcos of ESG lah!
Even if u r the minority who invest base on ESG as a sole criteria, if the investment do not generate good return in the long run, u r still screwed mah!
Palmoil is a food & and industrial product....the most efficient vege oil & fats input in the world mah!
Suppose u do not use palm oil & use soya oil instead as an alternative....u need to plant 8x more land to produce the equivalent palmoil mah!
But then soya oil will have even more ESG concern than palmoil mah!
Just imagine At the end, the world wil be paying more for vege oil & fats at the same time degrade the environment even more loh!
Thus it is only logical that the ESG concern on palmoil stock are unfounded given they are no better alternative for better oil & fats thus palmoil is still the best mah!
Thus rationally if u invest in palmoil stock u are protected the ESG, bcos it is the most efficient, at the same time u earn super decent dividend mah!
Furthermore u r well protected from inflation bcos plantation is a proxy of investing in cheap land...a very scarce resources mah!

(Nov 27): Bill Gates is best known for revolutionizing personal computing, but lately he’s gotten back to the land, MoneyWise reported.
The Microsoft co-founder and his former wife, Melinda, are the top farmland owners in the country, having acquired more than 269,000 acres over the past decade.
Gates made a splash in 2017 when he bought $520 million worth of U.S. farmland from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and he’s continued to invest since.
Farmland returned an average of 11.0% per year between 1992 and 2020, according to research from FarmTogether, an investment platform that allows qualified investors to purchase stakes in U.S. farmland without buying a whole farm. In comparison, the S&P 500 returned only 8.0%.
When considered on a risk-adjusted basis, farmland outperforms the stock market by a wide margin.
It's even better than traditional real estate, better than bonds and gold, MoneyWise reported."

Cost of production (at estate level) during recent years (2017-2020) were $1,500 -$1,800 pmt CPO depending on the cost efficiency of each planter.

Therefore, average Gross Margin in past recent years enjoyed by planters were $990 to $690 pmt CPO. (ie average CPO price $2,490 minus cost of production $1,500 to $1,800).
