Its aerospace, O&G segments have been doing well in 2019 and will continue to do well in 2020. Its semiconductor segment didn't do well in 2019 but will do well in 2020 due to recovery of semiconductor industry.
With all the 3 manufacturing segments having growth prospect, Kobay is almost certain to perform better YoY in 2020.
