KUALA LUMPUR: Vsolar Group Bhd and Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) mutually terminated their joint venture to develop solar energy facilities due to the poor rates of returns.
Vsolar, which is involved in solar renewable energy, announced on Thursday both parties decided on the termination based on the financial viability of the proposed project.
“Our financial assessment of the proposed tariffs potentially to be awarded by the regulators indicated poor rates of return on our potential investment,” it said.
On April 11, 2017, the company said the JV – in which it would hold 80% and UTM 20% – would develop the facilities with a capacity of up to 30 megawatts.
The JV was also to undertake research and development on solar energy generation technology and solar plant installation and construction design.
The project was to have been built on a site of about 20 acres for every 10 MW to be identified and provided by UTM.

KUALA LUMPUR (Jul 15): Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said he may pay another visit to China, potentially Shenzhen again, to attract more investment into Malaysia.
Lim said although the US is the largest foreign investor in Malaysia and is expected to continue to increase, but the potential of China’s capital is increasing.
“China has its advantage, and the US has its advantage. These two countries are among the best in terms of foreign investment, and they are both very important,” he told local Chinese media Kwong Wah Daily in an interview last Saturday.
Lim said if he visits China again next month, his focus will be on investment, so one of the destinations would likely be Shenzhen, to attract high-tech, high-value Chinese major manufacturers to invest in Malaysia.
Lim also said after his first official visit to China earlier this month, both countries' governments are discussing the possibility of establishing an interactive channel for the stock exchanges of both countries.
Lim said he would discuss this further with Chinese authorities if his next visit to the country materialise.
""I hope we can yield some results in the near future,"" he said.
Lim said in addition to investment and business, both countries also hope to strengthen securities and stock exchanges areas.
After a visit to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, Lim said they are studying whether it is possible to create a new platform that makes both capital and stock markets more competitive, and gain more access to financing.
Lim said this would require further works to be done, including formulation of the technological process and financing mechanism.
Lim hopes that after visiting China, he could accelerate the materialisation of this objective.
On the matter of potential raising of Panda bonds from banks in China, Lim said the Malaysian government is still considering it, as the government thinks that it deserves a lower interest rate.
Meanwhile, Lim said after visiting Huawei’s operation in Shenzhen and meeting its management, the technology giant pledged to strengthen its investment in Malaysia.
Lim also said representatives from Huawei will organise a visit to Malaysia as well, and he is scheduled to meet them to discuss more on the company’s potential implementation of 5G technology in Malaysia.
""They will come in a week or two. When I am in Penang, I will discuss with them,"" he said."

KUALA LUMPUR (Jul 15): Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said he may pay another visit to China, potentially Shenzhen again, to attract more investment into Malaysia.
Lim said although the US is the largest foreign investor in Malaysia and is expected to continue to increase, but the potential of China’s capital is increasing.
“China has its advantage, and the US has its advantage. These two countries are among the best in terms of foreign investment, and they are both very important,” he told local Chinese media Kwong Wah Daily in an interview last Saturday.
Lim said if he visits China again next month, his focus will be on investment, so one of the destinations would likely be Shenzhen, to attract high-tech, high-value Chinese major manufacturers to invest in Malaysia.
Lim also said after his first official visit to China earlier this month, both countries' governments are discussing the possibility of establishing an interactive channel for the stock exchanges of both countries.
Lim said he would discuss this further with Chinese authorities if his next visit to the country materialise.
""I hope we can yield some results in the near future,"" he said.
Lim said in addition to investment and business, both countries also hope to strengthen securities and stock exchanges areas.
After a visit to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, Lim said they are studying whether it is possible to create a new platform that makes both capital and stock markets more competitive, and gain more access to financing.
Lim said this would require further works to be done, including formulation of the technological process and financing mechanism.
Lim hopes that after visiting China, he could accelerate the materialisation of this objective.
On the matter of potential raising of Panda bonds from banks in China, Lim said the Malaysian government is still considering it, as the government thinks that it deserves a lower interest rate.
Meanwhile, Lim said after visiting Huawei’s operation in Shenzhen and meeting its management, the technology giant pledged to strengthen its investment in Malaysia.
Lim also said representatives from Huawei will organise a visit to Malaysia as well, and he is scheduled to meet them to discuss more on the company’s potential implementation of 5G technology in Malaysia.
""They will come in a week or two. When I am in Penang, I will discuss with them,"" he said."

Question is, solar panel is cheaper produced in China than Malaysia. If Malaysia can prove to manage solar power generation better than another neighbor country like China, why not give it a try?
What others competition amongst solar companies in Malaysia?
1. Cypark
2. PUC- creased their solar business
3. solarvest new IPO
4. Mattan Engineering- to raise 30mil for IPO
At the moment, these listed companies and Vsolar is the closest to get most contract related busineses.
Latest MOU with Mattan Eng S/B. Dated 2/10/2019
Mattan Eng intend to raise 30mil for IPO and so far, as they have not listed yet, Vsolar as a listed company play a much active role in solar energy.
http://www.mattan.com.my/mattan-hopes-to-raise-rm30m-from-ipo-in-first...
So, question is why Mattan Eng need Vsolar?
RESPONSIBILITIES OF VSOLAR THRU Subsidiary.
 To procure the permission of the landowner to achieve the objective of this MOU.
 To provide a business plan, FUNDING STRATEGY and roadmap prior to the development of the facility.
Responsibility of Mattan:
 To provide the required industry expertise and experience to conduct the feasibility study
To provide a feasibility report upon successfully conducting the feasibility study.
Vsolar spectrum:-
Vsolar The group is presently reviewing several renewable energy projects including examining opportunities to participate in the government’s drive to increase investments in the revised Net Energy Metering (NEM) Scheme.
The Ministry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment, and Climate Change (MESTECC) target to achieve 20% Renewable Energy (RE) in the national power mix by 2025 creates a wide range of opportunities for the group in terms of investment opportunities by way of solar leasing programs and technology solutions.
The 10th Malaysia Plan also spells out the government’s strategy in the RE area which gives new emphasis on the use of renewable energy, particularly the use of hydropower for electricity generation and the mandatory blending of biofuels for the transportation sector.
Premised on the above, the management of Vsolar believes that both Solar and Biomass/Biogas RE is a stable RE source for the future. Therefore, these businesses have a favorable outlook based on the increasing demand for RE.
In conjunction with NEM scheme and Mattan Eng, I strongly believe, Vsolar is helping Mattan to do some crowd funding for future IPO. If this is true, any projects shared, will bring synergy to Vsolar.
By hook or by crook, current 5.5-6 cents doesn't look to disappoint yet."

It was also upbeat on the government's target to achieve 20% renewable energy (RE) in the national power mix by 2025 which would create a wide range of opportunities for the group in terms of investment opportunities by way of solar leasing programs and technology solutions.
Vsolar said both solar and biomass/biogas RE was a stable RE source for the future.

100,000 lots , u can buy (1 share for 3 RI) 3 RI x 100,000 ( u be offered but you can reject/ignore if you don't want)
If 1 RI is 5 cts (as perinformed-later I check) , u need to pay another RM 15,000
on top, u get 2 warrants FREE ( I dunno the warrant $ yet) but assume is 2 cents,
200,000 x 2 cts= RM4000 if FREE
Your 100,000 shares of 5 cts = 5000
RI= 15,000

April 17, 2020
KUALA LUMPUR: In view of the current trying time, the Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) chairman Datuk Syed Zaid Albar announced that Bursa Malaysia will temporarily suspend Practice Note 17 (PN17) or Guidance Note 3 (GN3) classification on companies which financial positions slip into the status.
“We have already allowed PN17 and GN3 companies up to 24 months to regularise their financials.
“So, moving forward, in addition to this, after a discussion with Bursa, Bursa will provide companies listed on the Main Market, temporary relief from the PN17 classification in relation to certain criteria,” said Syed Zaid. The temporary relief also applied to GN3 for ACE Market-listed companies.
Currently, there are 25 Main Market-listed PN17 companies and three GN3 companies on ACE Market which need to regularise their financial positions.
The 28 companies now have more time to work out their regularisation plan considering they contend with challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic, said Syed Zaid.
“These measures will allow companies more time to regularise their financial positions. The period for this relaxation will be effective from April 17 this year until June 30, 2021,” he said during a virtual media briefing in conjunction with the release of the SC’s 2019 annual report yesterday.
Noting that extraordinary times call for extraordinary responses, Syed Zaid said “this is not business as usual” given the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic. He noted that the SC is deploying a wide range of regulatory tools to support the market and its participants.
While the SC is doing what it can to support the businesses, we remain steadfast in ensuring investor interest is protected during this challenging time. We continue to raise investor awareness on scams, as scammers tend to target people during times of uncertainty.
The SC will take a targeted approach to protect vulnerable investors and minority shareholders. I would also like to remind our intermediaries to remain vigilant and for PLCs (public limited companies) to remember their obligations to shareholders and to make timely disclosures,” he said.
The regulator also assured investors that the Malaysian capital market remains fundamentally strong and is functioning in an orderly manner, supported by deep domestic liquidity and complemented by the government’s stimulus packages.
As the financial system adjusts to the impact of Covid-19, Syed Zaid said the SC will continue to monitor the evolving situation in global and domestic markets, calibrate its responses and update the public accordingly."

I dare and prefer to maximise return with the same capital but less pressure counters.
this I did n keep on doing searching for kangtau to take advantage of market trend.
one of the counters I chosed was ageson pa , when it was 1 to 1.5 sen . I don't say it is good , I bought because of the minimum subscription as expected.

3. (Oops, not sure of question!)
4. 21%of 1.32=.28billion rights Or RM 8.2mil.

5. After Google, I worked out this formula for Vsolar: (0.44p+3.96f)/(0.44+1.32f), where p=price just before ex-date, f=fraction of rights subscribed

Vsolar via Cubetech Asia Sdn Bhd intends to bid and secure a quota underLSS@MenTARI programme, with the support of Mattan Engineering Sdn Bhd as the EPCC (Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Commissioning) partner to develop the Project. The Ministry has set the maximum capacity at 50MW per participant to encourage more locally owned enterprises to be involved in the renewable energy sector. Vsolar is delighted to engage Mattan, a company who has the expertise and a tremendous track record of managing and integrating multi-disciplined Renewable Energy projects in Malaysia. As an EPCC contractor,Mattan has completed a variety of turnkey projects in recent times. In November 2017, Mattan was appointed the turnkey EPCC contractor of a large-scale solar facility generating up to 50MW in Rembau, Negeri Sembilan, which as of to date, is ranked as one of the largest solar farm in Malaysia. The Project is anticipated to significantly increase Vsolar’s energy generation capacity and will mark a significant milestone for Vsolar if commissioned. The Energy Commission has set the bidding process to be closed on 2ndSeptember 2020 to ensure that any successful bidder can launch their solar facility by Q1 of year 2021."

--------------------------
Correct! All need to verify with ur remisiers the exact terms and expiry of OR or PR. Sometimes u saw cheap sale offered in the market but nobody touch it. Smell something fishy? They didn't disclose the terms if u don't ask. They scrapped their brokerage fees from u & other motha*&@*%$ fees u didn't realized and when the time exceeded, they will inform u need to pull out some extra money from ur pocket to convert the OR/PR u purchased to mother. If no balance in ur acc, ur OR/PR purchase will be forfeited (burn)! Ur hard earned money got eaten by licensed sharks just like that. Broker wins, u lose. Beware!"

KUALA LUMPUR (June 23): Technology sector will see ""powerful acceleration"" growth in both revenue and earnings, according to Franklin Templeton Investments.
""Once we get through this crisis, we're going to start seeing very powerful acceleration, not only in revenue but in earnings for this sector,"" said Jonathan Curtis, vice-president of Franklin Equity Group at Franklin Templeton Investments, in ""Tech Sector in the Post Pandemic World"" webinar session today.
""Investors are so positive about this sector right now. Because coming out of this crisis, it (the tech sector) is well positioned to drive very strong growth,"" he said.
Curtis highlighted that the expected exponential growth would materialise in the coming three to five years.
""The Covid-19 [pandemic] has accelerated the opportunity in this space and we think coming out of this current challenge, we are going to see an acceleration in technology investment,"" said Curtis.
In terms of valuation, Curtis said the sector's valuation is reasonable, given its long-term growth potential and high quality of growth.
He believes that the IT sector's valuation is elevated but not excessive, and when compared with valuations of the S&P 500, the tech index is only at an 8% premium currently.
Curtis pointed out that the price-to-earnings multiple on S&P 500 info technology index of 25.01 times currently is nowhere near the level in 1999 to 2000 of over 50 times. ""Thus, we don't think this is a bubble,"" he said.
On the local front, technology stocks can be seen swarming the top gainers list in the recent three months. Bursa Malaysia technology index, from this year's low of 23.81 points in March, has jumped 73.2% to 41.24 points at the time of writing.
The stellar performance of the four FANG stocks has helped fuel the upward trend among Malaysian tech stocks. All three Apple Inc, Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc have just hit a record high on Wall Street.
Alphabet Inc, on the other hand, has rebounded US$400 to US$1,451.86 from the low in March.
Curtis expressed his optimism about the tech sector, saying that its growth ""is going to go on for a long time"" on the back of digital transformation.
""The big opportunity in this space is digital transformation,"" said Curtis, saying that it will be supported by growth drivers such as artificial intelligence, fintech, internet of things, and 5G technology, among many others.
Curtis said the demand and the need to use the technology have really soared during the Covid-19 pandemic.
""We needed to learn how to work from home, educate from home, shop from home, exercise from home, healthcare from home, socialise from home and dine out from home,"" he said, adding that there has been a massive retraining of consumers on how the services work and what it could do, during the lockdown.
Curtis noted that consumers and businesses are going to continue to use these digital services and that retraining will continue not just until a vaccine is broadly administered, but even post the Covid-19 crisis.
Furthermore, he said that the tech sector has a ""very good quality"" being the third-most profitable sector across the S&P 500 by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation margins, adding that it is also one of the few S&P 500 sectors that are net cash positive."

TQVM for your response and sharing.
Just to put my mental and emotion state in ready mode. The company has potential to growth. The share price will probably at a solid or stabilized mode during Sept once Lss bid closed. Till that period, many factor will cause price up and down (rumours,oprtor/syndcate, etc) due to its penny price.
As traders, we keep to the discipline of Cut Loss (CL) once reach our CL price,
But as investor, do we keep to the same discipline of CL knowing current votalitites and future growth?
My TA:
cost per share 4.8c.
Support at 5.5c
CL at 4.5c
Been holding the shares from last year."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000076.jsp?ftp=128","Jul 3, 2020 10:39 PM","Jack Mak","KUALA LUMPUR (July 1): Vsolar Group Bhd’s share price soared to a new high today, fuelled by the counter’s robust trading volume of 1.015 billion shares, which far exceeded its 200-day average volume of 17.11 million.
The stock — which was the most actively traded across the bourse today — settled 30.77% or two sen higher at 8.5 sen on market close after the solar energy firm yesterday reported a narrower net loss of RM366,000 for the third quarter ended March 31, 2020 (3QFY20) versus RM648,000 in the corresponding quarter a year ago.
The group’s market capitalisation stood at RM34.9 million. The stock has reversed its losses since March 16, when the stock was trading at two sen, its lowest this year. Year to date, the stock's value has increased by 40%.
Vsolar’s narrowed net loss for 3QFY20 was achieved on the back of higher revenue of RM880,000, over six times the RM142,000 it achieved a year earlier, boosted by higher demand from information technology product sales during the quarter.
The group, however, saw its net loss widen to RM2.28 million for the nine-month period ended March 31, 2020 (9MFY20) compared with a net loss of RM1.22 million a year earlier, though revenue grew 50% to RM1.92 million from RM1.28 million.
The group said it is reviewing several renewable energy projects including examining opportunities to participate in the Government’s drive to increase investments in the revised Net Energy Metering (NEM) Scheme.
On June 16, the loss-making firm announced that it was looking into developing a large-scale solar facility under the Energy Commission’s LSS@MenTARI programme.
The ACE Market-listed group plans to bid for a quota under the programme, with the support of Mattan Engineering Sdn Bhd as the engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning partner to develop the project.
Maybank Investment Bank Bhd remisier Jeffry Azizi Jaafar said interest in the counter was driven by a few factors, including Vsolar’s collaboration with Mattan.
“Lately the [solar power] sector seems to have garnered positive sentiments especially from the Government. Last week TNB (Tenaga Nasional Bhd) awarded contracts to two companies for solar-related projects. This bodes well for the sector,” he told theedgemarkets.com when contacted.
“On the technical front, Vsolar has made a breakout from the resistance level of six sen on June 29. This led to the change in the share price trend from sideways to uptrend,” he added."

My name is Goh. I want to learn from you.
Hope you can teach me some good stuff below...
I am new to all these ""Mother share"", ""child share"",
wb (warrant??) conversion stuff.
This is what you wrote above ....
warrant conversion 0.03.
mother 0.04 equivalent to wb 0.01
mother 0.045 equivalent to wb 0.015
How does all these works? What is the purpose of
the conversion above? Why owner wants to do
the conversion? Any advantage for the owner?
How do you predict that the mother share will gap
down today? Why mother share go gap down after
the conversion mentioned by you above?
By the way, what is warrant (wb)? How does
warrant (wb) differs from ""Mother share""?
I know I ask a lot of basic questions. But I am really
new to all these stuff, and I want to learn.
Thanks."

Actually I bought some VSOLAR shares at RM0.055

So Mother share will go down after the above.
I am new to all these. So, I don't really know what is
""Right Shares""? what is ""Warrant""?
Why Mother share go down after the above?
Can someone explain? I wish to learn."

you can google to learn what is right shares, warrant and how price get dilution after additional shares listed.
example refer to below links :
https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/11/dangers-of-stock-dilut...
https://www.investopedia.com/investing/understanding-rights-issues/#:~....
as I am seeing a lot of new traders rush in to buy last week between 0.055 - 0.08 while knowing today after over one billion right shares listed, in theory price will get dilution which you can read all my comments last week for the alerts & sharing.
it is a very normal tactic for the operator to push up the price before right issues for the purpose to release their on hand stocks at higher price while retail traders rush in to chase high and being ""trapped-in"". after additional shares listed, price dilution will emotionally influence retail traders' decision to panic sell at lower price when seeing the opening price gap down."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000076.jsp?ftp=135","Jul 13, 2020 8:05 PM","nokchin","Hi maxprofit2020,
Thank you for the info provided.
I will read through the info myself, hopefully can learn
one or two things on my own.
As I have said above, I hope I could have known you
earlier, or could have read your alerts & sharing earlier
last week. But I only know you today. I only read your
post/comments only today. I only register myself this
account today, and post my comments only today.
You are right. Newbies like me rush in last Friday to
buy at RM0.055 . If I had read your alerts last week,
I will definitely wait until today to buy at the cheaper
price of RM0.04 . Anyway, I plan to play/hold this
counter for long term. I am sure after Sept/Oct (the
new 50MWatt project bidding announcement),
VSOLAR will fly.
Since you are also a keen investor of VSOLAR (as
you mentioned above that today you start collecting
& buying at RM0.04 AGAIN), so this make both you
and me together in the same boat... we are both keen
investor & supporter of VSOLAR!!
I plan to hold/invest in VSOLAR for mid to long term,
until I make some good profit. As such, I would
appreciate if you can continue to post alerts/info/
updates/news sharing about VSOLAR here, so that
in future, I won't miss any wise words/advice/alerts
from you. For example, if you foresee any huge
price movement and would like to advice buy or sell,
please comment here so that I can read. Your wise
words/advice mean a lot to me.
Thanks."

1) Traded volume reduced from Mon 363M => Fri 30M. The selling had been diminishing to very minimum. Either for big holders like Fintec to realize quick profit from the 34M units (bal holding 232M units) at 0.04/0.045 or retails traders being forced sell at 0.035.
2) TA indicators reached bottom by Thurs. Fri start to reverse from bottom.
3) Short term moving average lines reached bottom by Fri and start to form a U turn.
There is high probability that next week will be a rebound with resistance at 0.05 - 0.055, however if there is still remaining forced selling at 0.035, I will be glad to collect more (Fri matched some at opening)."

KUALA LUMPUR: A global renewable energy (RE) fund is said to be eyeing investments in local solar firms and may target Vsolar Group Bhd.
Vsolar is bidding for renewable energy projects, including contracts under the Large Scale Solar (LSS) scheme.
People with knowledge on the matter said the fund was looking at Malaysia as RE penetration here was still low, having reached only eight per cent of the energy mix, generated by LSS plants, feed-in tariff and net energy metering developers.
The world's top RE funds include BlackRock, RobecoSAM and Vontobel.
It is unclear which of the funds is looking to invest in Malaysia.
""There is potential for huge growth in Malaysia. The global fund wants a share in local energy projects. It arranges funding packages by taking equity stakes in companies around the world which have RE projects in hand or are bidding for contracts.
""The fund manager may target Vsolar as the stock is undervalued and they believe it has the potential for growth, having recently established a partnership with Mattan Engineering Sdn Bhd to bid for an LSS project of 50 megawatts (MW) from the government,"" a source said.
Malaysia recently opened competitive bidding for one gigawatt (GW) of solar plants worth about RM4 billion, the largest capacity offered under the LSS scheme.
The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, via the Energy Commission, is requesting proposals through a competitive bidding process for the development of the fourth cycle of LSS (LSS4) projects.
The bidding process is open to fully-owned local companies or with at least 75 per cent local shareholding for companies listed on Bursa Malaysia.
The solar plants under LSS4 are expected to start operating latest by December 31, 2023.
The development of each plant would take up to 18 months.
It is understood that Vsolar was eyeing more than one LSS project of 50MW.
The stock closed 1.5 sen higher today at seven sen.
Some 380.8 million shares exchanged hands. Volume-wise, Vsolar was the second most active stock traded on Bursa.
In a filing with Bursa on June 16, Vsolar said its wholly-owned Cubetech Asia Sdn Bhd, intended to bid and secure a quota under the LSS scheme, with the support of Mattan as the EPCC (engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning) partner to develop the project.
The Energy Commission has set the bidding process to be closed on September 2 to
ensure that any successful bidder can launch their solar facility by the first quarter of next year.
Vsolar said it tied up with Mattan as it had completed a variety of turnkey projects.
In November 2017, Mattan was appointed the turnkey EPCC contractor of a LSS facility generating up to 50MW in Rembau, Negri Sembilan, which as of to date, is ranked as one of the largest solar farms in Malaysia."

Cubetech rakan kongsi vsolar dari oversea yang collab bid for LSS project
Cubetech Asia Sdn Bhd Enters Into Collaboration Agreement With Mattan
Engineering Sdn Bhd To Explore The Feasibility of Developing A Large-Scale
Solar Facility
KUALA LUMPUR, 16 June 2020 – Cubetech Asia Sdn Bhd (“Cubetech”), a wholly
owned subsidiary of Vsolar Group Berhad (“Vsolar”) has today entered into a
Collaboration Agreement with Mattan Engineering Sdn Bhd to explore the feasibility
of developing a Large-Scale Solar Facility (“the Project”) under the LSS@MenTARI
programme launched by the Malaysian Energy Commission.
Vsolar via Cubetech Asia Sdn Bhd intends to bid and secure a quota under
LSS@MenTARI programme, with the support of Mattan Engineering Sdn Bhd as the
EPCC (Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Commissioning) partner to
develop the Project.
The Ministry has set the maximum capacity at 50MW per participant to encourage
more locally owned enterprises to be involved in the renewable energy sector.
Vsolar is delighted to engage Mattan, a company who has the expertise and a
tremendous track record of managing and integrating multi-disciplined Renewable
Energy projects in Malaysia. As an EPCC contractor, Mattan has completed a
variety of turnkey projects in recent times. In November 2017, Mattan was appointed
the turnkey EPCC contractor of a large-scale solar facility generating up to 50MW in
Rembau, Negeri Sembilan, which as of to date, is ranked as one of the largest solar
farm in Malaysia.
The Project is anticipated to significantly increase Vsolar’s energy generation
capacity and will mark a significant milestone for Vsolar if commissioned. The
Energy Commission has set the bidding process to be closed on 2nd September
2020 to ensure that any successful bidder can launch their solar facility"

Engineering Sdn Bhd To Explore The Feasibility of Developing A Large-Scale
Solar Facility
KUALA LUMPUR, 16 June 2020 – Cubetech Asia Sdn Bhd (“Cubetech”), a wholly
owned subsidiary of Vsolar Group Berhad (“Vsolar”) has today entered into a
Collaboration Agreement with Mattan Engineering Sdn Bhd to explore the feasibility
of developing a Large-Scale Solar Facility (“the Project”) under the LSS@MenTARI
programme launched by the Malaysian Energy Commission.
Vsolar via Cubetech Asia Sdn Bhd intends to bid and secure a quota under
LSS@MenTARI programme, with the support of Mattan Engineering Sdn Bhd as the
EPCC (Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Commissioning) partner to
develop the Project.
The Ministry has set the maximum capacity at 50MW per participant to encourage
more locally owned enterprises to be involved in the renewable energy sector.
Vsolar is delighted to engage Mattan, a company who has the expertise and a
tremendous track record of managing and integrating multi-disciplined Renewable
Energy projects in Malaysia. As an EPCC contractor, Mattan has completed a
variety of turnkey projects in recent times. In November 2017, Mattan was appointed
the turnkey EPCC contractor of a large-scale solar facility generating up to 50MW in
Rembau, Negeri Sembilan, which as of to date, is ranked as one of the largest solar
farm in Malaysia.
The Project is anticipated to significantly increase Vsolar’s energy generation
capacity and will mark a significant milestone for Vsolar if commissioned. The
Energy Commission has set the bidding process to be closed on 2nd September
2020 to ensure that any successful bidder can launch their solar facility

participate in the government’s drive to increase investments in the revised Net Energy Metering (NEM)
Scheme. The ministry of Energy, Science, Technology, Environment, and Climate Change (MESTECC)
target to achieve 20% Renewable Energy (RE) in the national power mix by 2025 creates a wide range of
opportunities for the group in terms of investment opportunities by way of solar leasing programs and
technology solutions. The 10th Malaysia Plan also spells out the government’s strategy in the RE area which
gives new emphasis on the use of renewable energy, particularly the use of hydropower for electricity
generation and the mandatory blending of biofuels for the transportation sector.
Premised on the above, the management of Vsolar believes that both Solar and Biomass/Biogas RE is a stable
RE source for the future. Therefore, these businesses have a favourable outlook based on the increasing
demand for RE."

The group said its unit Genbayu Gemilang Sdn Bhd has inked a joint venture (JV) agreement with Vsolar to regulate their relationship as shareholders of Cubetech Asia Sdn Bhd, which is bidding for the project.
""Cubetech Asia intends to submit its tender to build and operate a large-scale solar 4 (LSS4) proposed 50MW plant in Seremban subject to the terms and conditions stipulated in the JV agreement,"" the group said in a bourse filing.
""The project consists of terms including a concession period under a power purchase agreement with Tenaga Nasional Bhd, spanning 21 years starting from the commercial operation date by Dec 31, 2023,"" it added.
Under the agreement, Genbayu Gemilang will lease the required land to Cubetech Asia at no cost to undertake the project. The former will hold a 70% stake in Cubetech Asia, while Vsolar will hold the remaining 30% equity interest.
Permaju said Vsolar will manage and operate Cubetech Asia and assist the latter to secure financing for the project via a mix of equity and debt financing amounting to RM173.6 million and RM43.4 million respectively.
Vsolar is also to assist Cubetech to secure a bid bond amounting to RM1 million and a performance bond totalling RM10 million in the event the latter is awarded with the project.
""The JV agreement will provide opportunities for the parties to establish a strategic partnership for various activities based on the respective parties' expertise and strengths which allow the parties to tap into each other's expertise, networks and resources,"" said Permaju.
Shares in Permaju closed unchanged at 30 sen with 7.08 million units done. This gives the group a market capitalisation of RM58.78 million.
Vsolar's share price settled half a sen or 9.09% higher at six sen with 62.48 million units changing hands. This values the firm at RM103.52 million.

Emotion made rich people become poor
Emotion made good people become bad
Emotion made healthy people become sick
Emotion made something good to become bad
See, emotion can make you bankrupt you know, when you upset and angry, and when you cannot handle your emotion you might do unnecessary mistake without you realizing it
Example about bad emotion in investing:
You buy some shares at 0.100, and hope it can become 0.15 as soon as possible, after several week it didn't go as you planned, you become upset and just sell it now, which the price is 0.03... Do you know how much your loss? You're at loss baby
So my advice to you, learn to control your emotion, do not become angry and upset so easily.. Usually this happened when you have very little knowledge about investing strategy.. So most important thing is try to learn basic investing and gradually topup your knowledge about investing.
So 2 things
1. Emotion (learn how to be steady and control your emotion)
2. Knowledge (Must have sufficient knowledge, and up-to-date, e.g. reading books, news, etc..)"

Do not cut loss no matter how long you wait, I believe it will be no more than 6 months.. If you are lucky next month will reach your TP ;-) November Rain.
Guys, RM35,000 in your pocket with modal rm35k ONLY.. Less than 6 months, what else you want ;-) hehe

1-Future Energy (Green Energy)
2-A growing company (Low price compare to peers)
3-Right / ESOS to fund future project as per announced (Biogas / Solar)
4-A lot of foreign fund (Green Energy) will invest into potential company in Malaysia.
5-Government initiative to encourage Renewable Energy.
Better invest now and don't expect your investment to bear fruit tomorrow...Be patient, I believe this company give us better return compare to FD, Unit Trust, ASB etc.

Let's say u buy Vsolar at 0.045, then you intend to sell at 0.070, that's mean your TP1 is at 0.07
After that you wait a lil bit and buy at back at maybe 0.065, and you wanna sell at 0.095.. means to your TP2 is 0.095.. so it's basically the 2nd time u set the TP after u buy back"

Employees stock options Scheme (ESOS) are a type of equity compensation granted by companies to their employees and executives. Rather than granting shares of stock directly, the company gives derivative options on the stock instead. These options come in the form of regular call options and give the employee the right to buy the company's stock at a specified price for a finite period of time.
So in simple daily English, you can say it's a gift from company to the employees. When I become the President of Vsolar, I will also do the same thing, will give my employees the gift that they deserve. No more do they have to queue to buy i8 Vsolar shares to be a shareholder of this amazing company. Instead of queueing to buy at open market (Like most of us now), they will be a shareholder by buying it directly from this ESOS programme.
Imagine when you are an employees in Vsolar company, but you don't have even 10 lot of Vsolar shares... Isn't it shameful? Hehe, that's why we at Vsolar doing this ESOS programme so that our employees will easily own Vsolar shares without queueing :-)"

However, for non-employee, jou guys don't have to be frightened that our employees will sell off their shares ;-) They are not like u guys, buy today sell today ;-) hehe
In fact this shares (thru ESOS) must be hold for particular period of time, usually 1 year. So no story like "" oh, they sell off their shares which they get from ESOS programme.."" There's no thing like dat, sister.."

1. Reduces Air Pollution. Fossil fuels create a lot of pollutants.
2. Reduce Water Usage.
3. Reduces Dependence On Nonrenewable Energy Sources such as petroleum.
4. Improves Humanity's Health In The Long-run.
5. Helps Fight Climate Change."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000076.jsp?ftp=175","Nov 11, 2020 1:52 PM","Avalon88","Benefits of Solar Energy
1. Reducing air pollution
The air we breathe can help or hinder our health and wellbeing. Electricity generation from fossil fuels can generate harmful carbon dioxide and methane gases that lower the quality of the air we breathe. Breathing poor quality air on a daily basis can have dire consequences for our health. Air pollution has been linked to asthma and allergies, bronchitis, pneumonia, headaches, anxiety, heart attacks and even some cancers. Using the sun to generate more and more of our power means less and less harmful emissions from burning fossil fuels. Generating electricity from solar panels produce no harmful emissions, and the more homes and businesses that rely on solar power means less toxic emissions from fossil fuels into our air."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000076.jsp?ftp=175","Nov 11, 2020 1:53 PM","Avalon88","Benefits of Solar Energy
2. Using less water
Water is one of our most precious natural resources. We live on the driest continent on the planet, and we run the risk of running out of fresh water in the future. Traditional electricity production can use thousands of litres of water each year. Water is used for cooling generators, processing and refining fuel and transporting fuel through pipes. Generating power through solar panels, however, uses no water whatsoever. The operation of solar photovoltaic cells doesn’t require water at all to generate electricity, reducing the strain on this precious resource. The only water needed is rainwater to naturally clean the panels when they get a bit grubby!"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000076.jsp?ftp=175","Nov 11, 2020 1:57 PM","Avalon88","Benefits of Solar Energy
3. Reduces dependance on petroleum
Solar energy supplies are massive; if we could harness all of the sunlight shining on the earth for just one hour, we could use that energy to power the entire world for a whole year. The sunshine used in solar energy production is free, and there’s lots of it. On the other hand, fossil fuels are running out, and fast. Reducing our reliance on these finite resources and taking advantage of an abundant, free source of energy, such as sunlight, could mean lower energy prices, reduced greenhouse gas emissions and a stronger, more stable energy future.
Solar power has wide-ranging advantages for our planet, especially when it comes to our environment.
From reducing greenhouse gases, improving our air quality and conserving our precious water, solar energy can help to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and lower energy prices for years to come.."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000076.jsp?ftp=175","Nov 11, 2020 1:58 PM","Avalon88","Benefits of Solar Energy
4. Help to slow climate change
The release of toxic gases into the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, doesn’t just contribute to air pollution, but also contributes to the enhanced greenhouse effect. While the greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth’s surface to a liveable temperature, human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, have increased the amount of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. This has led to the enhanced greenhouse effect, which is warming our earth faster than ever before. In recent years, this has been linked to a number of catastrophic weather events, such as flooding, cyclones, storms, extreme heat and drought. Generating electricity from solar panels produce no greenhouse gases whatsoever, and so can help to reduce the effect of climate change if used widely. With solar energy powering a home or business, there is no burning of fuel and no emissions from energy production."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000076.jsp?ftp=175","Nov 11, 2020 2:53 PM","Avalon88","Benefits of Solar Energy
5. Human Health
One of the biggest benefits of solar energy is that it results in very few air pollutants. An analysis by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) found that widespread solar adoption would significantly reduce nitrous oxides, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter emissions, all of which can cause health problems. NREL found that, among other health benefits, solar power results in fewer cases of chronic bronchitis, respiratory and cardiovascular problems, and lost workdays related to health issues.
The benefits of solar energy are clear. Not only can you save money on your electric bills – you can also reduce your carbon footprint and improve the health of those around you."

1. Going solar will reduce greenhouse gas and CO2 emissions
2. Add an electric vehicle (EV) and drive on sunshine
3. Solar reduces water pollution
4. Solar reduces strain on finite resources"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000076.jsp?ftp=176","Nov 12, 2020 2:04 PM","Avalon88","1. Going solar will reduce greenhouse gas and CO2 emissions
The average Arizona home in US, consumes just under 13,000 kilowatt hours of electricity annually. Even a modestly-sized solar energy system can easily reduce that number by 80% while many can even approach 100%. Even at these levels, the environmental impact of solar is substantial. Over twenty years, producing just 80% of the average home’s annual energy requirements, a solar energy system will offset the equivalent CO2 emissions from over 150,000 pounds of coal burned, or the greenhouse gas emissions from 45 tons of landfill waste!
2. Add an electric vehicle (EV) and drive on sunshine
It’s pretty obvious that driving an electric car means fewer, if any, visits to the gas pump. Opting for an EV also means offsetting 100% of a traditional car’s harmful C02 emissions. But what many people don’t realize is that if you charge that EV from a non-solar home, all you're doing is moving the energy expense from the gas pump to your monthly utility bill. A properly designed solar energy system will power your home AND your car while helping to further offset the “dirty” electricity that you’d otherwise need to purchase from your utility.
3. Solar reduces water pollution
This one is a little less obvious, but certainly one of the biggest environmental advantages of solar. While all manufacturing processes require some water,including those used to make solar panels, the total amount of water needed to generate solar electricity is dramatically less than more traditional electricity sources. Older technologies such as nuclear, natural gas, and coal-fired facilities, all require massive amounts of water for cooling purposes. With solar energy, there’s almost no risk to local water resources, nor does their operation strain local supplies by competing with agriculture, drinking systems, and other vital water needs.
4. Solar reduces strain on finite resources
Global population will continue to grow, but our Earth only has a finite amount of oil, coal, and natural gas to give up. The sun is Earth’s most abundant energy source, producing a staggering 173,000 terawatts of solar energy every second! That's more than 10,000 times the world's total combined energy use and it’s available again and again. In contrast, fossil fuels are dirty and totally non-renewable. At some point, they will simply be gone, or the cost of finding and extracting them will be way too expensive for our strained population. If we don’t change, the resulting damage to our environment and strain to our financial infrastructure may simply be unrepairable. Going solar is the best way to hedge against the reality of dwindling resources.
Going solar is like saving the planet and keeping the change. In fact, it’s pretty much the only home improvement investment that will have an immediate and measurable impact on the environment while putting money back into your pocket from the moment it’s activated."

1. Solar power is pollution free and causes no greenhouse gases to be emitted after installation
2. Reduced dependence on foreign oil and fossil fuels
3.Renewable clean power that is available every day of the year, even cloudy days produce some power
4. Return on investment unlike paying for utility bills
5. Virtually no maintenance as solar panels last over 30 years
6. Creates jobs by employing solar panel manufacturers, solar installers, etc. and in turn helps the economy
7. Excess power can be sold back to the power company if grid intertied
8. Ability to live grid free if all power generated provides enough for the home / building
9. Can be installed virtually anywhere; in a field to on a building
10. Use batteries to store extra power for use at night
11. Solar can be used to heat water, power homes and building, even power cars
12. Safer than traditional electric current
13. Efficiency is always improving so the same size solar that is available today will become more efficient tomorrow
14. Aesthetics are improving making the solar more versatile compared to older models; i.e. printing, flexible, solar shingles, etc.
15. No trenching is needed since the solar can be close to or at the place of installation"

Fantastic Impact on the Environment
Benefits of Solar Energy Solar energy has the least negative impact on the environment compared to any other energy source. It does not produce greenhouse gases and does not pollute the water. It also requires very little water for its maintenance, unlike nuclear power plants for example, needing 20 times more water. Solar energy production does not create any noise, which is major benefit, since a lot of solar installations are in urban areas, such as domestic solar panels."

Author: damiantreez | Publish date: Wed, 2 Sep 2020, 9:10 AM
KUALA LUMPUR (Sep 1): Permaju Industries Bhd has teamed up with Vsolar Group Bhd for a RM217 million large-scale solar power project in Seremban.
The group said its unit Genbayu Gemilang Sdn Bhd has inked a joint venture (JV) agreement with Vsolar to regulate their relationship as shareholders of Cubetech Asia Sdn Bhd, which is bidding for the project.
""Cubetech Asia intends to submit its tender to build and operate a large-scale solar 4 (LSS4) proposed 50MW plant in Seremban subject to the terms and conditions stipulated in the JV agreement,"" the group said in a bourse filing.
""The project consists of terms including a concession period under a power purchase agreement with Tenaga Nasional Bhd, spanning 21 years starting from the commercial operation date by Dec 31, 2023,"" it added.
Under the agreement, Genbayu Gemilang will lease the required land to Cubetech Asia at no cost to undertake the project. The former will hold a 70% stake in Cubetech Asia, while Vsolar will hold the remaining 30% equity interest.
Permaju said Vsolar will manage and operate Cubetech Asia and assist the latter to secure financing for the project via a mix of equity and debt financing amounting to RM173.6 million and RM43.4 million respectively.
Vsolar is also to assist Cubetech to secure a bid bond amounting to RM1 million and a performance bond totalling RM10 million in the event the latter is awarded with the project.
""The JV agreement will provide opportunities for the parties to establish a strategic partnership for various activities based on the respective parties' expertise and strengths which allow the parties to tap into each other's expertise, networks and resources,"" said Permaju.
Shares in Permaju closed unchanged at 30 sen with 7.08 million units done. This gives the group a market capitalisation of RM58.78 million.
Vsolar's share price settled half a sen or 9.09% higher at six sen with 62.48 million units changing hands. This values the firm at RM103.52 million.

Buy 1,000,000 shares at price 0.05, then set TP 0.100.

Do not sell no matter how long you wait, I believe it will be less than 6 months.. If you are lucky next month will reach your TP ;-) (LSS4 will be granted next month)
Guys, RM50,000 in your pocket with modal rm50k ONLY.. Less than six months, what else you want ;-) hehe
If God willing, RM50K next week with modal rm50k, guys, you know it better ;-)
That RM50K + your initial money RM50K = Total RM100K guys ;-)

Regarding your question about ESOS, not true, nobody in the company sell their shares, since we all knew that BIG Project coming.
If you refer to the latest ESOS, then you should know it cannot be sold in near future, it has it's maturity time. Cannot buy today sell tomorrow, that's not how it works bossku."

1. Sila ubah username mu, ibubapa mu akan merasa sangat menyesal dan malu melihat mu menggunakan nama sampah. Nama dah elok mereka bagi, mu pula pegi ubah nama sendiri jadi sampah, xpa ubah secepat mungkin namamu bhai.
2. Tentang ESOS, itu ada scheme untuk kakitangan/staff dalam Vsolar company untuk memudahkan mereka membeli saham tanpa perlu membeli dari open market. ESOS ni adalah merupakan hadiah/ganjaran bagi staf, agar mereka rasa dihargai. Kelebihannya ESOS adalah para staff boleh beli direct, cepat n mudah. Kekurangannya, staff ni tak boleh jual saham tu bila2 masa yg depa nak, sebab pembelian saham melalui ESOS ni ada tempoh simpanan dia, maksudnya beli dan simpanan sampai tempoh tertentu (biasanya setahun, bergantung kepada t&c dalam agreement). So basically ESOS ni memudahkan staff untuk jadi pemegang saham syarikat.
3. Private Placement (PP) ni pun lebih kurang, cuma PP ni untuk Banks/ Institutions. Memudahkan pembelian, cepat dan murah. Kekurangannya banks/institutions tadi tak boleh jual saham yg depa beli through PP tu, melainkan selepas beberapa tahun (ada yang setahun, bergantung kepada T&C dalam agreement).
Sebab tu EPF biasa beli kat open market ja, supaya depa boleh jual secepat mungkin, epf ni macam jerung yg suka jual awal, kadang dia beli pagi dia jual petang, hahaha
So bagi mengelakkan jerung yg suka jual awal macam epf tu, Vsolar jual saham kepada jerung melalui PP, supaya depa ni, jerung2 xboleh jual awal"

There are many PP that don't declare who is the buyer. If their shares not more than 5%, then they even require to declare their selling...(if i'm not mistaken, it is 5%).No worries, when stock is too heavy, operator somehow will resists to goreng as it spend too much effort to push it up. Btw, there are many good stock in bursa, you can play others......for this counter, shark is collecting at 0.038, so...I donu, we nvr know their plan. If they want to earn 100%, so it could be 0,075?

You need to understand it like this
1. Company (Vsolar) selling the shares through Private Placement (PP)
2. Bank/Institutions buying it, and want to sell it
For the Number 1 statement:
Company (Vsolar) selling the shares through Private Placement (Like before this they announce want to sell their shares through Private Placement)
= Yes, anytime they can sell their shares to the bank/institutions, etc...
Number 2 statement
Now the bank/institutions have bought the shares through the PP, when can they sell after they bought the shares?
= After a particular period which mentioned in the T&C of their agreement
Sometimes after years
Understand or not?
Means after bought it, cannot sell immediately"

Mu kena check sendiri bro, jangan ikut cakap orang membuta
Kalau bank/ institutions yang beli saham Vsolar melalui Private Placement tu boleh jual immediately saham yang dia beli, rugi la Vsolar, betul tak? Sedangkan dia jual ke Bank/institutions tu adalah untuk tambahan modal, faham tak? Sebab tu diwujudkan kaedah membeli saham secara Private Placement untuk mengumpul modal bagi syarikat yg menjual saham tadi (Vsolar).
So bank/institutions yang membeli tu pun untung, sebab dapat saham, dan syarikat Vsolar pun untung, sebab bank tadi dah beli saham dia, so situasi win-win untuk kedua2 pihak.
Selepas suatu masa yang ditetapkan, katalah setahun, dalam perjanjian waktu bank beli melalui PP, time tu harga saham dah naik, bank tadi dah boleh jual saham yang dia dapat dari Vsolar tadi, so untung.
Vsolar pun harga saham dia dah naik, so kalau bank jual saham dia pun, masih lagi untung, so nampak x, dua2 pihak untung.
Dalam perniagaan ni bro kalau salah satu pihak kerugian, tak jadi perjanjian perniagaan tu bro.
Disebabkan kedua2 pihak untung, sebab tu la depa nak buat perjanjian perniagaan tu"

What the registrar told u is, Vsolar company can sell it's shares anytime, through PP, and if Vsolar company want to sell more than 10%, Vsolar company need to inform Bursa Malaysia, otherwise they just sell it without announcement
The registrar told is about Vsolar company. From the Vsolar point of view. Not from the point of view of shareholders (bank or institutions whi bought the shares from PP)"

EPF suka beli dari open market, macam kita ni, beli dari open market
Sebabnya adalah, kalau EPF beli saham melalui PP, dia xboleh jual terus, dia kena tunggu sebab dalam T&C S&P agreement ada dinyatakan berapa lama dia kena hold saham tu, x boleh jual sampai masa hold tu habis
EPF suka beli saham dari open market sebab beli hari ni, besok kalau harga saham naik, dia boleh terus jual, haa nampak tak? Hehe, boleh check record EPF, diorang selalu beli dari open market."

Investing in stocks maket is different from any gambling business that you know. In gambling business, they need operator, in stocks investment, there's no operator, you only have your self, you're the one who do all things, from choosing which company you want to invest until the day you choose to sell the shares that you have.
No operator sister, maybe you think this is like gambling, NO sister, this is not gambling, no operator at all. iF you really insist to have an operator, then you are operator for yourself.

Up and down and up again, that's reflect ourself bro, you know our heart beat pattern? It's the same.
Normal for the graph to up, down, and up again. So how to decide it's good or not? You to see the graph trend, is it uptrending? If it's uptrending, then might be good to have that particular shares
In Vsolar cases, the graph is uptrending since 3 weeks ago, mostly because of investors awareness about the green energy, and the prospect of Vsolar get the LSS4 grant from the government
It's a bright company bro, when you already have Vsolar shares, congratulations, you a part of society that makes our world greener and better, especially for our offsprings, our next generations

This is an undervalued yet over-rated green tech stock in KLSE. What more can you expect from the current valuation? For me, I'd just buy and keep it till it matures and peak above 15cts.
Fundamental, as long as it is done right with no window dressing, I'll take it for what it is. Current ratio and debt is at a positive ratio, so what more do some of the investors or should I say, speculators want? Keep it in your portfolio. It's a good addition and has a positive ROR for you in the foreseeable future.

The thing with buying a stock and waiting for the valuation to play out are heavily attached to emotions.

This is the only stock that are still undervalued having boasted great cash reserves as opposed to stocks that are dwindling down the PN17 line.

I urged you to think from the standpoint of debt and price valuation of a company. In this case, VSolar has the cash, followed by its astounding reserves aided by its robust fund holdings from its shareholders.
What more do you expect? A company like this falling into the PN17 list? Impossible.
As a project manager, who would you grant the project to? A financially stable powerhouse in the industry. Often times when the company experiences financial troubles, projects are often nabbed and presented to the other bidders. This in return causes an influx of troubles since they will have to reconduct the entire process again to have the mission fully attained.
Price valuation wise, what would be the rate of return from the current pricing be as opposed to buying other solar powerhouses at the ringgit range? You are getting a steal buying VSolar at the CTS range even though it's a penny stock.
Debt valuation, this company has a solid financial strength to overtake and oversee any projects at any time of the day I understand that they might have failed the LSS3 and if you were to compared the cash reserves prior to what they have now, it differs greatly. Any project sounds AMAZING to VSolar now since it could turn this company around for the better.
Unlike the big dogs in the solar industry, any projects feels like a job on the run since they have gotten it beforehand. This is the DIFFERENCE maker when it comes to investing. Understand the why and be immersed into it. I have said enough and I hope it catches the attention of the naysayers.
Cheers and have a great day investors.

Buy 1,000,000 shares at price 0.045, then set TP 0.100.
Potential gain is about RM54,700 (WOW!)
Do not sell no matter how long you wait, I believe it will be no longer than 6 months.. If you are lucky this month will reach your TP ;-)
Guys, RM54,700 in your pocket with modal rm45k ONLY.. Less than 6 months (Because this is short term investment plan), what else you want ;-) hehe
If God willing, RM54,700 next week with modal rm45k, guys, you know it better ;-)
That RM54,700 + your initial money RM45K = Total RM100K guys ;-)"

You should ask it in vsolar-wb forum, but never mind maybe next time you should ask it there, since you asked it here, I will answer it.
Vsolar-wb support is 0.02, if you have bought at 0.025, better sell it and queue to buy at 0.02, if you haven't bought it, then better queue at 0.02, hope that will answer your question. Thank you

这些仙股存在即合理，首先是有别于股的审核制，大马的上市是注册制。这为企业上市提供了很大便利，同时也有一些不怀好意的企业混进来，林子大了什么鸟都有。
其次大马是以机构投资者为主，机构投资者有能力辨别好的或不好的股票，那些不好的股票，被丢到一边，股价只能持续走低。
仙股有散户需求，散户像垃圾堆寻宝一样，希望能捡到暴涨几倍的（自己以为能起），所以这些仙股对于有些投资者来说有种蜜汁吸引力。得益于此，仙股一直能够在大马市场横行。
什么是老千股，怎么辨别老千股，今天本大侠给大家科普下。
怎么辨别老千股?
资本运作频繁
频繁的资本运作（ 公司没能力赚钱一直亏钱集资生存 ）、特别是供股(包括公开发售 PP，SIS ) 和合股 (shares consolidation ) 是识别“老千股”的一个典型特征和首要依据。
低股价
低股价是老千股特征，但由于频繁的供股和“向下炒”，股价长期低于 10c，也即所谓“仙股”已经很大程度上成为“老千股”的一个共性。
跌幅深
同样由于“老千股”“向下炒”的财技，其复权后股价往往都经历过很深的跌幅，标准为当前股价相比历史高点跌幅至少在80%甚至90%以上。
小市值
一定程度上，其低股价和小市值恰恰是“老千股”的行为所致。
基本面差
基本面差的个股才会考虑通过财技来牟利。因此，我们的筛选标准是自上市以来，净利润亏损年份超过一半时间，没有分股息。
老千股”利用财技收割韭菜的大致做法为：
通过利好消息或者其他方式将股价拉升，吸引二级市场投资者入场，等到了高位的时候不断出货，用手中筹码往下砸，当价格到了低位的时候，大股东再通过上市公司合股后在供股低过市场的价格方式在补回之前抛售的股票。"

VSOLAR was established in 2014 with a mission to provide cheaper, cleaner & renewable power source. As our name “VSOLAR” suggests – we are in the sunlight business. Malaysia sits in an advantageous position on the equator line – with an average daily solar radiator of 4500 kWh and abundance of sunshine up to 12 hours a day. We believe that sunlight has an infinite source of potential energy with zero waste.
It all began with a vision for a brighter and better tomorrow for the next generation. Every source of energy known to man produces pollution of some kind.

1. Using less water
Water is one of our most precious natural resources. We live on the driest continent on the planet, and we run the risk of running out of fresh water in the future. Traditional electricity production can use thousands of litres of water each year. Water is used for cooling generators, processing and refining fuel and transporting fuel through pipes. Generating power through solar panels, however, uses no water whatsoever. The operation of solar photovoltaic cells doesn’t require water at all to generate electricity, reducing the strain on this precious resource. The only water needed is rainwater to naturally clean the panels when they get a bit grubby!"

2. Reducing air pollution
The air we breathe can help or hinder our health and wellbeing. Electricity generation from fossil fuels can generate harmful carbon dioxide and methane gases that lower the quality of the air we breathe. Breathing poor quality air on a daily basis can have dire consequences for our health. Air pollution has been linked to asthma and allergies, bronchitis, pneumonia, headaches, anxiety, heart attacks and even some cancers. Using the sun to generate more and more of our power means less and less harmful emissions from burning fossil fuels. Generating electricity from solar panels produce no harmful emissions, and the more homes and businesses that rely on solar power means less toxic emissions from fossil fuels into our air."

3. Help to slow climate change
The release of toxic gases into the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, doesn’t just contribute to air pollution, but also contributes to the enhanced greenhouse effect. While the greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth’s surface to a liveable temperature, human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, have increased the amount of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. This has led to the enhanced greenhouse effect, which is warming our earth faster than ever before. In recent years, this has been linked to a number of catastrophic weather events, such as flooding, cyclones, storms, extreme heat and drought. Generating electricity from solar panels produce no greenhouse gases whatsoever, and so can help to reduce the effect of climate change if used widely. With solar energy powering a home or business, there is no burning of fuel and no emissions from energy production."

4. Reducing your household’s carbon footprint
Solar energy is one of the cleanest sources of energy, and it’s an extremely effective way of your household more efficient and sustainable. Solar panels don’t use any water to generate electricity, they don’t release harmful gases into the environment, and the source of their energy is abundant and, best of all, free. Using solar energy instead of the grid also means you reduce the need for carbon dioxide emitting energy to be produced for the grid on your behalf – for energy users, you could offset anywhere between a half to one tonne of carbon dioxide for every megawatt-hour of solar energy you use. With even a small system installed on your home, you can help reduce your household’s carbon footprint :-)"

5. Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels
Solar energy supplies are massive; if we could harness all of the sunlight shining on the earth for just one hour, we could use that energy to power the entire world for a whole year. The sunshine used in solar energy production is free, and there’s lots of it. On the other hand, fossil fuels are running out, and fast. Reducing our reliance on these finite resources and taking advantage of an abundant, free source of energy, such as sunlight, could mean lower energy prices, reduced greenhouse gas emissions and a stronger, more stable energy future."

Feels alot already cutloss hence the frustration and vent it out here. Advice, just focus your energy elsewhere and manage your own capitlal.
I only put my money here cause is easy to manage with no volatility while i trade at other counters. Not gonna lie is frustrating waiting and i have waited since October. Thought of selling in Dec due to the supposedly announcement of projects.
So if someone promote and ask to buy, go think for yourself first. Dont simply ikut orang. I even topup my warrants holding yesterday and i could cutloss myself eventually if things dont go well.
Wah cant believe i spent my weekend typing this out.

In my opinion since the director of VSolar is also same as Lambo. Thus, I will say it will take along time to get some ROI. But if you invest 1M shares at 0.035 and sell at 0.05, ROI is 15k.
LSS4 might be out in March. To those waiting good luck!
For those who want quick money look at other counter. VSolar buy for long term is good enough.
All the best!"

those are same bosses and controlled by same group of goreng kaki ....
their sop is : keep private placements / consolidation
once their account got money , the directors can get a high pay but do nothing.
once their account almost no more 'water' , private placement again...
after some years when the price low enough , they do consolidation then private placement again.
you guys can check those companies i mentioned above ...
my suggestion to new and old bird : NEVER put a single cent in this kind of company, let goreng kaki - kaki goreng kaki song, if you think you are smart enough ... always thinking buy more lots and earn 0.05c and lari ... you will get trap at the end of the day.

Cadangan Majlis Pecah Tanah Projek Taman Solar Sultan Ibrahim di Pengerang, Johor yang dijadualkan pada 23 Mac ini dengan keberangkatan DYMM Sultan Johor dibatalkan.
Majlis pecah tanah projek berkenaan terpaksa dibatalkan kerana sehingga kini Kerajaan Persekutuan belum memberikan sebarang maklum balas berkaitan cadangan projek tersebut.
DYMM Sultan Johor sebelum ini, bertitah mengumumkan Johor akan menjadi pengeluar utama tenaga mesra alam, dengan pembukaan taman tenaga solar di Pengerang.
""Taman Solar Sultan Ibrahim"", projek bernilai RM1.4 billion itu akan menjadi yang terbesar seumpamanya, di Asia Tenggara dengan berkapasiti 450MW (megawatt).
Ia adalah projek pelaburan swasta berskala besar yang pertama diperolehi oleh Negeri Johor bagi tahun 2021 atas usaha Baginda Tuanku Sultan yang sentiasa mengalakkan pelaburan dan pembangunan ekonomi untuk rakyat dan negeri Johor.
Projek itu juga seiring dengan Pelan Pembangunan Mapan Johor 2030 yang mengutamakan kelestarian alam sekitar dalam pembangunan ekonomi dan kemakmuran hidup rakyat.
Ia akan turut memberi impak kepada pembangunan ekonomi Negeri, dengan penawaran kerja kepada pelbagai peringkat, kerana ia juga akan menjadi sistem penyimpanan tenaga solar terbesar di rantau ini apabila beroperasi sepenuhnya menjelang 2023.
""Saya nampak tidak ada alasan mengapa Kerajaan Persekutuan tidak boleh berikan peluang kepada Negeri Johor untuk menjadi pengeluar tenaga elektrik yang mesra alam ini, kita ada kawasan tanah yang sesuai, pembangunan yang pesat di negeri ini dan permintaan daripada negara jiran, menjadikan Johor sebagai lokasi yang paling strategik"" titah Baginda Tuanku Sultan."

Gocean lambo netx fintech... Etc..
All are the same taoke... Doing the same trick pp and share consolidation...
Check yourself on bursa... One day these share will become 0.05 then delisted.
Think think think think x 100 times.. If you want to put a single cent into this kind of busuk company.
You should put your money into recovery counters... Bank... Even genting lost money also shoot up to 5.3 because taoke tak busuk... Cantik...

Better to invest in bank or other business making entities. I have learnt my lesson here and how Bursa works. Thus, dont trust every company on bursa just because its a penny stock.

Dalam pengajuan bursa hari ini, pihaknya mengatakan akan menerbitkan sehingga 846.22 juta atau 30% daripada saham terbitannya yang ada kepada pelabur pihak ketiga bebas untuk dikenal pasti, pada harga terbitan yang akan ditentukan kemudian. Hasil yang dijangkakan akan diperoleh berdasarkan harga terbitan ilustratif 2.66 sen per saham penempatan, yang merupakan potongan 19.88% kepada harga pasaran rata-rata berwajaran lima hari saham hingga dan termasuk 9 Mac, 3.3 sen .
""Saham penempatan akan dikeluarkan berdasarkan diskaun tidak lebih dari 20% kepada VWAP lima hari saham hingga dan termasuk hari perdagangan terakhir tepat sebelum tarikh penetapan harga, yang akan ditentukan oleh dewan setelah mengambil mempertimbangkan keadaan pasaran yang berlaku, ”kata VSolar.
""Hasil dari penempatan swasta yang diusulkan diharapkan dapat digunakan terutama untuk membiayai biaya awal awal untuk Proyek PV Solar. Ini termasuk kos untuk penilaian kelayakan yang akan dilakukan di lokasi serta perolehan bahan dan komponen untuk pemasangan sistem PV suria (mis. Panel, rak pemasangan, penyongsang dan kos pemasangan). Kumpulan ini juga boleh mengambil kakitangan tambahan untuk pengurusan projek dan menanggung perbelanjaan lain-lain seperti kos pengangkutan di lokasi untuk projek-projek tersebut, ”kata VSolar.
Bersama dengan penempatan peribadi, VSolar mencadangkan untuk menubuhkan skim opsyen saham pekerja yang melibatkan sehingga 30% dari pangkalan saham yang dikeluarkan untuk pengarah dan pekerja syarikat yang layak.
VSolar menjangka cadangan akan diselesaikan pada suku kedua 2021.
Mercury Securities telah dilantik sebagai penasihat utama dan ejen penempatan untuk cadangan penempatan swasta.
Saham VSolar ditutup tidak berubah pada 3.5 sen hari ini, memberikan kapitalisasi pasaran kepada syarikat sebanyak RM98.73 juta, setelah sekitar 7.23 juta saham selesai."

盘查操控60仙股神秘黑手事件
10/04/2021
权威财经周刊THE EDGE报导揭露，执法当局在数个星期前，突袭及盘查雪州丽阳高球俱乐部一带的联和大（MENARA LIEN HOE）数家公司，取走文件，以调查数名特定人士参与操纵大马交易所仙股案件。
THE EDGE报导说，执法当局是接获投报，指国内一个由数个神秘人物控制的集团，控制高达60家上市公司，并通过种种手段，操纵股价，更以各种财技手法，从上市公司吸资金或资产。
报导说，调查焦点集中於一名四十岁左右神秘企业家，该名人士通过代理控制大量上市公司，但是却没有一间上市公司和他有直接关系。
THE EDGE制作一个图表，列出和这名神秘企业家有关的数十家上市公司，大多数由SANSTON FINANCIAL GROUP控制，这家公司是由香港SANSTON持有，根据这家公司官网显示，它是持有香港牌照的证券行。
THE EDGE在报导中引述一些部落格撰文指出，该名男子控仙股的规模和手法，堪称是另一个＂苏启文＂，市场上有关该名人士操控多家上市公司的传言，流传多个月。
根据了解，有两个执法单位，即反贪污委员会和内陆税收局参与有关执法行动，突袭联和大厦，但是证券监督委员会并没有在行动中。
THE EDGE也引述消息说，国家银行正在紧密观察该集团的动向。
该集团控制的40家上市公司中，有11家办事处设在联和大厦，包括宜鼎（AT），MLABS，富科斯（FOCUS），万科科技（MTOUCHE），FINTEC环球（FINTEC），XOX说（XOX），M3科技（M3TECH），NETX HOLDING，LAMBO GROUP，KGROUP，VSOLAR集团等。"

矛头指向前上市公司董事 苏式小股风暴大马上演？
Nanyang Mon, Apr 12, 2021 11:24pm - 12 hours ago
（吉隆坡12日讯）财经周刊《The Edge》报道，60多只热炒仙股背后的势力已经引起市场和执法单位的关注，其集团头目更是被一些部落格网站拿来与涉及新加坡2013年“小股风暴”案的拿督苏启文相提并论。
根据本报在网上的观察，这些部落格指向的人物是一名前上市公司董事，在数年前曾因涉及操纵股价而被证监会提控。
《TheEdge》引述消息人士说：“这伙人中的头目是个聪明的人……他完全没有出面，所以线索没有指向他。我们无法证明他在这个事件的幕后，所以很难归罪于他。”
报道称，这伙人的头目没有与这些上市公司有直接的关系，并很好地利用了香港股票经纪公司Sanston金融集团作为其代理，将60多家公司把控在掌心中；该头目据称年龄接近50岁。
另外，《The Edge》也指出，虽然据了解该集团所掌控的本地上市公司数量超过60家，但该报仅找得到其中40多家涉及公司的线索。
证监会密切关注
本报也尝试联络这些被点名公司的媒体方负责人，但截稿前尚未收到回复。
税收局和反贪会是在数周前，突击了这伙人在雪州Persiaran Tropicana路附近的联和大厦办公楼，并带走了相关文件；单单这家大厦，就是多达11家涉及公司的大本营。
另外，尽管证监会没有参与其中，但问及有否展开调查时，该机构以其政策为由，不透露任何详情。
不过，一个靠近证监会的消息人士透露，证监会已关注着这伙人和他们操控股票的行为一段时间了。
国行关注有否洗黑钱
另一消息人士还指出，国家银行也正监视着该头目与同伙，看是否能从中发现到洗黑钱的行动。
根据了解这些上市公司内部营运的消息人士，公司内的资产与资金已被转走。
例如，在今年1月，XOX说电讯（XOX，0165，创业板）崛起为DGB亚洲（DGB，0152，创业板）大股东；FINTEC环球（FINTEC，0150，创业板）在去年7月，才卖出DGB亚洲股权，不再是大股东。
积极发股筹资
根据《TheEdge》资料，Sanston直接持有FINTEC环球4.61%股权，后者间接持股的Key Alliance（KGROUP，0036，创业板），直接持有XOX说电讯10%股权。
同时，这些上市公司几乎都发股筹资，目的可能是为了发行新股，和收购资产。
当中，如宜鼎系统（AT，0072，创业板）、VSolar集团（VSOLAR，0066，创业板）和FINTEC环球，更是趁着马交所近期放松发股10%门槛之便，借机发行更高的20%，乃至30%新股。
单在年初截至上月中，宜鼎系统进行了两次私配和一次附加股发行后，股本就大幅扩大逾8倍，至42.3亿股；该公司也透过雇员认股计划（ESOS），在上月发行多达14.5亿股新股。"

“Kita mesti menghentikan penggunaan arang batu sepenuhnya di semua negara OECD (Organisasi untuk Kerjasama dan Pembangunan Ekonomi) pada 2030 dan di semua negara pada 2040,” kata Guterres ketika melancarkan laporan terbaharu PBB mengenai keadaan Iklim Global pada 2021 pada Isnin.
Guterres berkata dunia perlu sepakat bertindak dengan efektif untuk memastikan ekonomi global yang sifar pembebasan gas rumah hijau pada 2050 serta harus menghapuskan semua subsidi arang batu dan bahan bakar fosil lain.
“Ini adalah laporan mengejutkan dan perlu dibaca semua pemimpin dunia. … Cabaran kita jelas. Kita sudah tersasar. Tahun ini adalah tahun untuk bertindak. Perancangan iklim untuk 10 tahun akan datang perlu lebih berkesan,” katanya.
Guterres menyeru supaya “perang kemanusiaan terhadap alam semula jadi ditamatkan” dan dunia tidak boleh berlengah lagi kerana 2021 adalah tahun penting bagi masa depan manusia sejagat."

因此，我们看到的高位大单买入只是庄家为了诱多挂上去给散户看的，并不是真的买入，即使买入也庄家利用对倒自己买卖，只是账户不同，但实际上都是庄家自己掌握的账户，只要能吸引到大量的散户来买入，庄家就会快速卖出其他账户的股票。这就是高位庄家出货时表面上看上去不断有大单买入，股价却在不断下跌的真正原因。
股价只是反应当时股票交易价格，有卖才能有买。有大单买入说明买家看好这支股票的未来成长性。同样买家能买到这么多，说明同时有这么多卖家在卖出。同样也说明有这么多人不看好这支股票的未来成长性。当然这其中还会有其他因素，比如获利退出，比如机构需要回笼资金等等，总之是有人在卖出。
所以不能单纯的以有大单买入判断股价应该上涨，还得看其他更多人是否有信心。就以最近几天股市来看，大手笔买入的股票不在少数，短期股价也确实被拉升上来了，但没过一天又放量下跌，市场实在没信心。
“主力”、“庄家”也是股市中经常被提级的，散户是既爱又恨，却也没任何办法。 只要不是像工商银行、中国石油这样的大盘股，一般盘子小一些的股票，还是有很多资金量足够的机构可以左右一下股价的，比如他们想低价建仓，或者想高价退出，都会使用大单做一些小动作。因为这种大单很容易被散户捕捉到。 因为这种事情被处罚的人并不少，甚至获刑的也有之，但利益实在太大，所以总会有人前仆后继，区别只在于是否被发现而已。
所以遇到这样的情况不要奇怪。坤鹏论仍然建议我们在选股票的时候要选企业经营好的，而不是短期盈利多的，这样风险才小，过度关注大单买入、卖出的价值并不大。
如何判断股价上涨的真假
股价变动是通过涨跌来体现的。我们这里所说的涨跌，不是指每日涨一点或跌一点的小波动，而是指股价持续阶段波动或者日涨跌幅度很大的波动。在底部区域，一只股票成交量不能太少，特别是振幅不能太小，成交量少、振幅小的股票没有弹性，后市潜力可能不大。一只股票经常在涨幅排行榜前列出现，也经常在跌幅排行榜前列出现，敢涨也敢跌的股票才是好股票（以庄家没有赚过钱为前提）。这样的股票以后可能成为大“黑马”，值得重点关注。对待上涨，最关键的是要区分清楚股价是不是真正的上涨。
（1）从来没有上涨过的，而且股票价格定位又不高的，真涨的可能性就大。
（2）股价离庄家成本不远的，上涨的概率就很大。
（3）股价位置低，经过了充分盘整的，上涨的概率就更大。
（4）没有消息，没有明显上涨理由的（主要指利好刺激），真涨的可能性很大。如果短期配合出利好消息的，则只是小一段。
（5）因为出现突发性利好而上涨的，上涨可能持续不了多久。已经涨幅巨大的，下跌不久就要来临。
（6）缺少成交量配合的上涨，真实程度不够（除非经过放巨量震荡整理后缩量上行，且是控盘的庄股，此类股票以后不会太多）。
（7）没有气势的涨是虚涨（除非持续不断小阳上涨，且温和放量），上涨可能是假的。
（8）上涨过快的股票，除非经过长期的震荡整理，且量价配合理想，并刚刚进入庄家的拉升阶段，否则当心“震荡”或反转。快得很有“气势”的，可能是短跑黑马。
（9）慢涨盘面上如果有慢的手法，经常有点“花招”又长期不涨，让人腻味的；股民不愿参与的，没有持股信心的；股价位置不高，又经历了充分震荡、换手的，可能是大黑马。
（10）经过充分炒作累计上涨幅度巨大的股票，一旦开始下跌，其后可能有数次间歇性的上涨。尽管有时幅度还不小，但这仅仅是反弹而已。快跑为妙，千万不要抱有任何幻想。
我们对待涨跌都应该有一个直接的认识。上涨不一定都是好事，顶部阶段的放量暴涨，下跌途中的单日放量突涨，以及平衡市和熊市中遇反弹时的大涨，可能都不是什么“福音”。
因此对股价的涨跌，应辩证地看待。上涨蕴含着的是风险，下跌孕育着的是机会。涨虽然是机会，但如果涨得不真实或涨的基础不牢靠或者上涨的幅度过大、过急，则上涨就蕴含着风险，并且伴随着上涨，下跌是迟早的事情，而下跌的机会则更大。首先，只涨不跌就积累了巨大的风险，涨幅越大则风险越大，而下跌可以化解风险。其次，经过下跌以后，上涨基础反倒是坚实的，并且下跌为上涨积累了能量。最后，股市是逐利的场所，下跌幅度越大，机会就明显越大（以不是熊市前提），追逐利润最大化的新多庄家就会入场，赚钱的机会也就来了。
震仓、拉高、出货、反弹行情中常用的几种
对敲庄家对敲主要是利用成交量制造有利于庄家的股票价位，吸引散户跟进或卖出。庄家经常在建仓、震仓、拉高、出货、反弹行情中运用对敲。庄家对敲的方式主要有以下几种：
第一：建仓。通过对敲的手法来打压股票价格，以便在低价位买到更多更便宜的筹码。在个股的K线表现为股票处于低位时，股价往往以小阴小阳沿10日线持续上扬。这说明有庄家在拉高建仓，然后出现成交量放大并且股价连续的阴线下跌，而股价下跌就是庄家利用大手笔对敲来打压股价。这期间K线图的主要特征是：股票价格基本是处于低位横盘（也有拉涨停的），但成交量却明显增加，从盘口看股票下跌时的每笔成交量明显大于上涨或者横盘时的每笔成交量。这时的每笔成交会维持在相对较高的水平（因为在低位进行对敲散户尚未大举跟进）。另外，在低位时庄家更多的运用夹板的手法，既上下都有大的买卖单，中间相差几分钱，同时不断有小买单吃货，其目的就是让投资者觉得该股抛压沉重上涨乏力，而抛出手中股票。
第二：拉升。利用对敲的手法来大幅度拉抬股价。庄家利用较大的手笔大量对敲，制造该股票被市场看好的假象，提升投资者的期望值，减少日后该股票在高位盘整时的抛盘压力（散户跟他抢着出货）。这个时期散户投资者往往有买不到的感觉，需要高报许多价位才能成交，从盘口看小手笔的买单往往不容易成交，而每笔成交量明显有节奏放大。强势股的买卖盘均有3位数以上，股价上涨很轻快，不会有向下掉的感觉，下边的买盘跟进很快，这时的每笔成交会有所减少（因为对敲拉抬股价，不可能像吸筹时再投入更多资金，加上散户跟风者众多，所以虽出现“价量齐升”，但“每笔成交”会有所减少）。
第三：震仓洗盘。因为跟风盘获利比较丰厚，庄家一般会采用大幅度对敲震仓的手法使一些不够坚定的投资者出局。从盘口看在盘中震荡时，高点和低点的成交量明显放大，这是庄家为了控制股价涨跌幅度而用相当大的对敲手笔控制股票价格造成的。
第四：对敲拉高。当经过高位的对敲震仓之后，股评家也都长线看好，股价再次以巨量上攻。这时庄家开始出货，从盘口看往往是盘面上出现的卖二、卖三上成交的较大手笔，而我们并没有看到卖二、卖三上有非常大的卖单，而成交之后，原来买一或者是买二甚至是买三上的买单已经不见了，或者减小了，这往往是庄家运用比较微妙的时间差报单的方法对一些经验不足的投资者布下的陷阱，散户吃进的往往是庄家事先挂好的卖单，而接庄家卖出的往往是跟风的散户。
第五：反弹对敲。庄家出货之后，股票价格下跌，许多跟风买进的中小散户已经套牢，成交量明显萎缩，庄家会找机会用较大的手笔连续对敲拉抬股价（这时庄家不会向以前那样卖力了），较大的买卖盘总是突然出现又突然消失，因为庄家此时对敲拉抬的目的只是适当的拉高股价，以便能够把手中最后的筹码也卖个好价钱。
盘后我们怎么去快速选出超短线需要密切关注的票呢?其实选股方法少说也有几千种，我想没有人统计过，我用过许多选股指标，不是选不出股票就是选出一大堆，而且成功率也不高。我说过我是个喜欢折腾的人，折腾指标、折腾预警、折腾选股，经过一些日子实践，针对超短线，总结出一套自己的选股方法，又快成功率又高，现用图文讲解公之于众，算是抛砖引玉吧

Penempatan pertama diumumkan pada 11 November, dan yang kedua diumumkan kira-kira sebulan kemudian pada 16 Disember, kedua-duanya sebagai modal kerja untuk operasi penyelesaian fotovoltaik solarnya. Ia mengumpulkan sejumlah RM16.5 juta. Harga terbitan untuk penempatan pertama ditetapkan pada 3.42 sen pada 6 Jan 2021, dan untuk yang kedua, pada 3.78 sen sesaham pada 11 Nov 2020, ketika harga sahamnya diperdagangkan sekitar empat sen. Awal tahun ini, kumpulan itu mengumpulkan RM36 juta melalui terbitan hak yang diselesaikan pada 13 Julai. Ini adalah untuk mengumpulkan dana capex untuk pembangunan dan pembinaan loji biomas atau biogas. Selanjutnya, syarikat setakat ini telah memberikan 901.8 juta saham di bawah skim penerbitan saham, setara dengan kira-kira 30% daripada modal sahamnya"

Calling external auditors of loss making penny stocks
External auditors have a big role to play to ensure companies do not cheat shareholders by hiding potential red flags from the audit report.
If Serbadk can sue KPMG for trying to raise potential red flags then shareholders must also be able to sue auditors for trying to hide potential red flags.
https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/serba-dinamik-take-legal-action...
https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/kpmg-says-audit-was-proper-and-...

Not to deny there are many other FDI solar companies, but due to lack of supply capacity, local companies gets to be a contract supplier. We never know if any foreign company may takes over or buys a stake in VSOLAR when demand becomes extremely huge............"

KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 5): Vsolar Group Bhd topped the list of most active stocks on the local bourse today amid a sudden spike in trading volume to almost 17 times its 200-day average.
At the closing bell, the penny stock gained half a sen to 1.5 sen, with a total of 880.4 million shares traded — the highest level since June last year — equivalent to 20.6% of its issued share capital of 4.266 billion.
It was unclear what factors were behind the spike in Vsolar’s trading volume as trading of shares in the counter had been tepid since July 14.
Fintec Global Bhd, which has ceased to be a substantial shareholder of Vsolar, was the second most traded counter today. Its trading volume swelled to 273.48 million shares.
Fintec’s subsidiary Asiabio Capital Sdn Bhd sold 82.05 million shares or a 1.9% stake in Vsolar on the open market, according to filings with Bursa Malaysia.
Filings with the exchange showed that Fintec sold shares in several public listed companies, including 33 million shares or 5.7% of Komarkcorp Bhd, besides the stake in Vsolar.
Fintec disclosed in a filing that the block of 33 million Komarkcorp shares that it disposed of represented 91% of its shareholding in the company, while the Vsolar stake sold represented about 35% of its shareholding in the renewable solar photovoltaic-related service provider.
Fintec, which was among the companies that ventured into rubber glove manufacturing last year, has also ceased to be a substantial shareholder of Saudee Group Bhd as the former’s shareholding was diluted after a rights issue.
Saudee was the third most traded stock today, with a trading volume of 156.7 million shares.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Will there be share consolidation for VSOLAR ?
Is FINTEC GLOBAL taking profit or cutting loss ?
Or moving funds to goreng small-cap stocks ?"

I reinstate my statement under the pretense of ""buying momentum"". Frankly speaking, I had worked out an algorithm that has a predictive capability of 87% and I rarely share the results of its operation to the public.
Since, you don't know what I am after, I am sharing it loud and clear to you.
My plan:
I plan to buy 5 mil shares at 0.06cts (last November highs). My algorithm detected possible upsurge from 0.06 to 0.23cts. I don't know what the company is up to but that is from my technical view. Anything lesser than 0.06cts is not desirable. I have been at the penny game for almost 8 years now. My US stock portfolio ROI is consistently winning at 82% with losses capped to below 5%.
You want to make a bet? Let's do a deal then. Let's see if my 6cts breakout is right or your prediction works."

So don't be foolish to buy into it thinking that ""Oh its breaking 0.06 so might as well buy now"".
I do it for a reason and I am successful in Penny investing also because I knew what these penny companies are up to. If you buy low, you are dead. The only way is to strategize in buying upside at a point where it is ""ASSURED"" not ""GUESSING GAME"".
So, I have my given my fair share of warnings as to what NOT TO DO and what TO DO if IT HAPPENS. I am open to discussion anyways, feel free to inquire more :)"

For now, there isn't much to do aside from sitting and waiting to see it lining up to our expectations. The greatest payout of short-term return in the GE sector likewise originates from SLVest and Pekat's short-term share price movements.
In regard to VSolar, you know we aren't buying right? We will only participate if there is a breakout. Only fools attempt to buy now to enrich the operators lol. Even a mere queue at base price offers nothing to the shareholders but risk. The risk is out of the radar when it goes above 0.06cts.
If this penny lives up to the game of being a solar performer, well you and I will come to witness a change soon. For now, let our bets do the talking while we sight see and anticipate haha."

The worst part of it all is the ones that bought a lot. I guess them going bankrupt or losing all of it is validated too since like u said, greed kills. Best part is to sell all the holdings and be smart in buying.

pursuant to the revised valuation report of ESOS granted (RM4.17 million) and additional ESOS
