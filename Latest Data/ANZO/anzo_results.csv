“As the progress of the project, including the decision to revise the whole development concept and development components, solely depends on the direction from KL Northgate, ACSB as the tendering party will only be able to submit the tender documents upon KL Northgate finalising the contract document and pricing of the project, estimated by October 2018,” Anzo said.

Last time I was choose big 5 - Anzo , Zelan , Orion , Pworth , XOX .
WHy because those once near 0.045
I was thinking whoever hit 045 I buy .
Lucky finally I choode Orion and Pworth
see my comment on Orion .
Fiannly Orion profit 100% ( oledi sold with 100% easy moeny )., Pw break even
And be honest actually my first choice is Anzo why ?
because ANzo highest 60sen now 4sen and Anzo future is the best among all my big 5 because Anzo future got big profit and Anzo call many times RI with highest price so I assume Anzo inside got
cash and no cash issue now .
However now I check back find out Bursa is a big Casino
good future like Anzo is the worst
Orion is the best
Zelan also keep going up to 9sen
Anzo lucky me skip you if not I cannot over this 2019 cny
untl now I still not dare buy
Anzo you so weak
cannot fight like Orion and Zelan"

Unless otherwise stated, words and phrases used in this announcement shall have the same meaning as defined in the announcement dated 4 October 2019.
We refer to our announcement dated 4 October in relation to the Termination.
The Board of Directors of the Company wishes to announce the following additional information in relation to the Termination:-
1) Further information on the Project up to the date of termination, including the status (percentage of completion) of the development, total financial commitment incurred and contribution received and recognised by your Company for each of the financial year since the commencement of the contract.
Phase 1 Contract is part of the Porto De Melaka Hotel and Resort Development Project in Melaka. The % of completion of Phase 1 Contract to the date of termination is 22%.
Attached please find the project revenue and gross contribution for respective financial years since the project commenced:

So far the Company has incurred RM31.15 million for the construction costs and RM7 million for the performance bond, while receiving only RM3.64 million for Phase 1 of the contract.
2) Provide greater granularity on your statement “In view of the financial challenges faced by both TAE and ACSB, which is a circumstance beyond the control of either party, and in the interest of the project” as your statement does not provide much insights on the rationale for the Termination.
The current property market is facing great challenges due to the current property glut, tight lending policies by financial institutions to property development companies and poor market sentiment. The sales of the Service Suites under the Phase 1 Contract is also being affected and has contributed to the weak cash flow position of TAE. As ACSB does not want to make any additional financial commitment into the project, it was deemed necessary to have a mutual termination of contract in order to release ACSB from its’ contractual obligations and liabilities under the Contract.
3) Provide greater elaboration on the financial effects of the Termination upon taking into consideration the financial commitment that ACSB has put in as well as the exact date when the Group stopped recognizing the revenue and income from the contract, given the fact that the termination agreement was entered into on 3 October 2019.
The Group has stopped recognizing the revenue and income from the contract since October 2017. As such, the accounts for the financial year ended 31July 2019 has already reflected the financial impact without any contribution from the contract. Secondly, by the original term of the letter of award, the contract work is supposed to be completed within 30 months from the commencement of work, which is 31 August 2019 and there wasn’t any application for extension of time for the said contract work as both parties are in the midst of negotiation for mutual termination of contract.Therefore, the contract is expected to have minimum impact towards the future earnings of the Group in the ordinary course of business.
4) It is noted that TAE has offered second contract for Phase 2 of the same Project to Harvest Court Construction Sdn Bhd as announced on 22 and 24 March 2017, 2 and 4 May 2017. In this regard, please confirm on whether the Termination will have any legal, financial and operational implications on the aforesaid second contract offered by TAE and the steps to be taken to address such implications, if any.
This Mutual Termination Agreement is only confined to Phase 1 Contract and does not have any legal, financial and operational implications on the Phase 2 Contract.
This announcement is dated 9 October 2019"

Anzo Holdings Bhd, an affected listed issuer that may not have a level of operations adequate to warrant continued trading or listing on Bursa Malaysia, announced today the termination of two collaboration agreements it inked nearly three years ago for a planned RM420 million project in Petaling Jaya.
The first was the collaboration agreement signed between its wholly-owned subsidiary Harvest Court Properties Sdn Bhd (now known as Anzo Properties Sdn Bhd) and Captivate Max Sdn Bhd, which Anzo said has been terminated due to unfavourable market conditions.
Separately, Anzo said the collaboration agreement between Anzo Properties and DVM Innovate Sdn Bhd — a unit of Key Alliance Group Bhd — for the development of a proposed e-commerce fulfilment hub, has also been terminated upon expiry."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001708.jsp?ftp=241","Jun 30, 2020 8:56 AM","High5","KUALA LUMPUR: A new shareholder has emerged in Anzo Holdings Bhd, less than a week after the company sealed a RM1.3 billion contract to supply millberry/candy copper scrap to a South Korean-based steel making group.
In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Anzo said CSTME Resources Sdn Bhd had been buying up shares in the company and was now a substantial shareholder with an 11.621 per cent stake.
Things could get more exciting for Anzo.
Rumours has it that a Chinese global fund had been buying up shares in Anzo and would likely end up as a majority shareholder in the timber and property development company.
It is understood that Anzo was expected to make an announcement on a new shareholder as early as this week.
Anzo fell three sen today to close at 14.5 sen, with some 216.4 million shares traded.
It was the third most active stock traded on Bursa Malaysia.
Last week Anzo, its subsidiaries and CSTME entered into an agreement to supply millberry/candy copper scrap to the South Korean group.
CSTME had agreed to purchase birch/cliff copper scrap or berry/candy copper scrap from Anzo.
CSTME is one of the major importers and exporters of non-ferrous materials in Malaysia, specialising mainly in copper products.
Anzo said it would supply up to 60,000 tonnes of copper scrap to CSTME at RM23,000 tonnes 40 months.
CSTME, which has an AP (approved permit) license, will buy the products from Anzo before exporting to the South Korean group from July 1.
The Korean group is buying the products indirectly from Anzo for remelting into copper plates and copper products for industrial and electrical construction purposes.
Anzo said the deal was expected to strengthen its trading business for sustainable earnings in a long period, as well as create business opportunities in the international export market.
Its managing director Datuk Eddie Chai Woon Chet told the New Straits Times last week that with the deal, Anzo was expected to turn around in the current year ending July 31, 2020.
Anzo has been actively seeking new businesses to diversify its income stream after posting losses for many quarters."

The company is expected to make an announcement on the deal soon.
Last week, Anzo told Bursa Malaysia that it had secured a RM1.3 billion contract to supply millberry/candy copper scrap over 40 months indirectly to a steelmaker in South Korea effective from July 1.
People with knowledge on the matter said the glovemaker had been looking to cash out after being in business for over 15 years and aproached Anzo to buy it over.
The glovemaker, which has the licence to export medical gloves, produces more than one billion pieces of nitrile gloves per annum, worth about RM400 million.
It is expected that Anzo would start exporting nitrile gloves from next month to countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom.
""The return on investment for Anzo should be six to 12 months. Anzo may sell the gloves at the current market price of US$70 to US$75 per box of 1,000 pieces. The net profit for Anzo is expected to be in the region of RM150 million or more,"" said a person close to the glove-making company.
According to him, the factory has nine production lines that can churn up to 100 million pieces of gloves a month.
Anzo can increase the production lines to 12 or 15 should demand exceed supply, he said.
""The World Health Organisation has warned of a chronic global shortage of personal protective equipment including N95 masks and gloves brought about by the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic.
""Further, Anzo has been seeking to diversify to mitigate loss of earnings from its current business of property development. The glove business is a lucrative business and it is expected that it will continue to prosper even post-Covid-10,"" he said.
The stock opened one sen higher at 17.5 sen today, giving it a market capitalisation of RM147 million.
Some 20 million shares exchanged hands."

Lets do some simple calculations.
Top Glove produces 78.7 billion gloves per year with 700 production lines. That is 112.5 million pieces per year for 1 production line or 9.4 million pieces per month per production line.
Anzo new glove company has 9 production lines, which can produce a total max approximately 84.6 million pieces per month (assuming this new company has the same efficiency and productivity as Top Glove).

Anzo Holdings Berhad managed to reduce its cash burn by 100% over the last twelve months, which is extremely promising, when it comes to considering its need for cash. But it’s hard to delight in that cash burn reduction given the 74% collapse in revenue. In light of the data above, we’re fairly sanguine about the business growth trajectory. In reality, this article only makes a short study of the company’s growth data. This graph of historic earnings and revenue shows how Anzo Holdings Berhad is building its business over time"

There’s no doubt Anzo Holdings Berhad seems to be in a fairly good position, when it comes to managing its cash burn, but even if it’s only hypothetical, it’s always worth asking how easily it could raise more money to fund growth. Generally speaking, a listed business can raise new cash through issuing shares or taking on debt. One of the main advantages held by publicly listed companies is that they can sell shares to investors to raise cash to fund growth. By comparing a company’s annual cash burn to its total market capitalisation, we can estimate roughly how many shares it would have to issue in order to run the company for another year (at the same burn rate).
Since it has a market capitalisation of RM18m, Anzo Holdings Berhad’s RM73k in cash burn equates to about 0.4% of its market value. So it could almost certainly just borrow a little to fund another year’s growth, or else easily raise the cash by issuing a few shares."

It may already be apparent to you that we’re relatively comfortable with the way Anzo Holdings Berhad is burning through its cash. For example, we think its cash burn reduction suggests that the company is on a good path. Although we do find its falling revenue to be a bit of a negative, once we consider the other metrics mentioned in this article together, the overall picture is one we are comfortable with. Looking at all the measures in this article, together, we’re not worried about its rate of cash burn, which seems to be under control. While we always like to monitor cash burn for early stage companies, qualitative factors such as the CEO pay can also shed light on the situation."

截稿时，该股是第四大热门，达6223万股易手，市值为1亿7757万令吉。
最新报价为3年来最高。今年迄今，安卓控股的股价已从年初的3仙低位，飙涨了近6倍或17.5仙。
该集团上周五向大马交易所报备，以5500万令吉现金，收购Wintrade World私人有限公司的土地、建筑、机械、设备与车辆等资产，以生产医用手套和丁腈手套。
该集团指出，已与Wintrade就收购位于霹雳州曼绒的资产签署一项意向书，并称这些资产已就绪，每月可生产约1亿只医用和丁腈手套。
安卓控股将召开股东特别大会（EGM），以获得股东对拟议收购的批准。
根据公司网站，该集团生产木材产品，如木门、木材模具和其他工程产品，此外还涉足建筑和室内设计业务。"

The assets are ready to be mobilised and commissioned to produce 1.2 billion pieces of medical and nitrile gloves a year.
This mean they purchased an abandon company without workers. You can't find any info online about Wintrade world, this could possibly mean it had stop operation for a long time.
very clear they just want to jump on the bandwagon of recent glove hot trend. It could just end up like AT (announced buying a glove company) , went up to as high as 0.195 and drop straight back to 0.08 in a few days. Good luck and happy trading."

The orders are to supply more than 1 billion pieces of medical gloves/nitrile gloves. Anzo is new player in the glove manufacturing industry and it is a milestone for the company to be able to secure a US$200 million order to supply the medical gloves in less than a week after announcing that it is acquiring a glove manufacturing company with assets that include land, factory and machinery in Manjung, Perak."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001708.jsp?ftp=254","Jul 8, 2020 3:48 PM","gloveking619","The factory has 9 production lines that can produce up to 1.2 billion pieces of medical gloves/nitrile gloves a year. Depending on the orders, Anzo may increase the production lines to 12 or 15 lines to make more than 2 billion pieces a year.
The orders from the United States may have come in because of the recent spike in coronavirus cases. The United States recorded 39,379 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours on Sunday (Monday in Malaysia), the fourth consecutive day of surging numbers of new infections, including a high of 57,683 on Friday.
The total number of cases in the US is 2,876,143 and infections continue to inch up in the country. The US also recorded 234 new fatalities, bringing the total death toll in the country to 129,891.
Several other countries around the world are also hit hard by the global pandemic such as South America, Europe, Russia, and India."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001708.jsp?ftp=254","Jul 8, 2020 3:48 PM","gloveking619","Countries around the world are placing orders in Malaysia for medical gloves. This is because Malaysia is home to some of the world’s largest glove makers and they are currently running at full capacity.
Meanwhile, with the US$200 million medical glove orders from the United States and Europe, it surely will improve Anzo’s earnings moving forward.
As it is, Anzo has also started to supply copper scrap to a South Korean steel maker effective July 1. It won a RM1.3 billion contract last month to supply the copper over a period of 40 months.
No wonder the company’s share price surged to a new high today (July 6) to close 23 sen. It is expect to hit limit-up this week and I am quite certained the stock will achieve the target."

How can the purchase price being determined at RM55 million when Anzo has yet to conduct a market valuation on these assets to be purchased? Why there isn't any profit guarantee provided by the Seller? It is IMPOSSIBLE for 9 production lines to produce 100 million of gloves per month. Not even Top Glove can achieve that quantity.

Permaju Industries Bhd and Anzo Holdings Bhd will work together via a joint venture to fabricate and expand the latter’s glove manufacturing plant in Manjung, Perak, so it could generate more than US$400 million in revenue a year.
Anzo needs to do this soon as its order book for gloves is rising up. We expect Anzo’s existing order book of US$200 million will double soon to over US$500 million.
We have reported that Anzo has secured an order each from the United States and Europe to supply over 2 billion pieces of medical gloves, worth an estimated US$200 million. The order book for Anzo will increase as the number of coronavirus cases around the world keeps rising.
As at July 12, 2020, the number of coronavirus cases is at a staggering 12.39 million while total deaths are 557,395.
The total number of cases in the United States is 3.22 million and infections continue to inch up in the country. The United States also recorded a total death toll of 135,822.
Several other countries around the world are also hit hard by the global pandemic, including Europe and India and there is a shortage for medical gloves.
Large orders continue to come in for Malaysian glove manufacturers.
Malaysia, which is the world’s biggest producer of medical gloves, is supplying almost 70 per cent of world demand.
Local glove manufacturers, whose stocks have rallied since the beginning of the outbreak of the Covid-19 disease, are expected to get more orders in.
After the US announced the new numbers in coronavirus cases, the stocks of Malaysian glove manufacturers like Top Glove Corp Bhd, Supermax Corp Bhd and Hartalega Holdings Bhd rose significantly hitting a new high today.
Although they are big manufacturers, their current production capacity is not enough to meet global demand and this allows new players like Anzo to get a chunk of the cake.
Do keep a close watch on Anzo and Permaju. We can expect some rally or heavy movement today and next week on this news.
We have said before that Anzo is expected to hit-limit up. This is based on an analysis we got from an analyst friend who is familiar with the matter.
In fact we can say Anzo is close to hitting a limit-up as the stock has jumped from a low of 2 sen more than a month ago to 23 sen early this week.
Even Permaju is gaining momentum this week, moving from the 24.5 sen range on Monday to touch 36 sen on Wednesday (July 8).
While the market is rather quiet today, a check on Bursa shows both the stocks have high volumes today.
I am excited to see how Permaju and Anzo close today at 5 p.m."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001708.jsp?ftp=262","Jul 13, 2020 12:35 PM","Bursa1575","Lately, in a liquidity-driven stock market, even lifestyle bloggers and websites have taken to writing about public-listed companies being awarded multi-million contracts.
One such company, which just announced its venture into making rubber gloves via an acquisition, is said to have clinched a US$200 million contract to supply gloves over the next two years. However, there is no mention of such a contract in its exchange filings so far nor has it made any announcement to dispute the “news”.
When asked, Bursa Malaysia says that “a listed issuer must make due enquiry and immediately publicly clarify, confirm or deny any rumours or reports, which it becomes aware of, whether true or false, that contains material information”. It adds that if the exchange comes across reports containing material information, it would engage the relevant listed issuer to ensure compliance with the listing requirement.
“Where necessary, the exchange will issue an unusual market activity query to ascertain the veracity of material announcements. We will not hesitate to take appropriate enforcement action(s) against the listed issuer or its directors, should there be a breach of the standard of disclosure under the listing requirements. It is our priority that investors are provided with accurate and timely information with which to make investment and trading decisions,” says Bursa.
The question is whether investors, especially retail investors, would take the trouble to verify information they get over various medium in this digital age. It is said that instant messaging app Telegram has hundreds of groups just on investing where information and — likely, misinformation as well — is freely shared.
Investors should separate the wheat from the chaff and refrain from following the herd.
But in a market where fundamentals seem to have taken a back seat, it would not be far-fetched to surmise that many in the market are playing a game of musical chairs, hoping they will not be left holding the baby when the music stops."

The insider bought at 0.16 becuz of copper deal, and suddenly price rise due to fake news, if it”s me i will sell as well.Lol. Now price fall and starts convincing ppl to sell, why? Want to jump in again at cheap price mah . It is not saying that this co worth this price at this level, but panic sell now just losing opportunity for next goreng wave in short term, and in long term if glove is processed, 0.2+ nt a problem also. Tons of counter been push high and consolidate at unreasonable price also. Stay calm,Just avg down and hold month if you are nt out of cash, support is at 0.14 to 0.16 now. Below this can str8 grab."

But then glove acquisition news out(official), push up till 0.195. Now stable at 0.075 to 0.08. And sometimes goreng reach 0.10 to 0.13 again. As comparison, anzo , get copper deal, and want to start glove production, loss is lesser than AT, and reach high till 0.25, so it is real difficult to fall below 0.1. For me i will hold, will nt sell below 0.18, unless copper deal is fake + glove is not realistic. If glove production deal is unsuccessful( nt the fake order news) , very hard to push up more than 0.2. Then can sell, if glove deal is done, can hold until 0.2+ in long term. With the copper deal, i believe fundamental price = 0.05to 0.08+ at least. Plus also new holder who bought this stock. Support at 0.1+."

There is one stock broker/analyst says like this:-
Currently in Bursa, among all the (so many) glove makers,
ANZO (and also AT Systemization) has the lowest trading price.
Well I actually agree with that stock broker/analyst.
Just compare the price of Careplus, Supermax, Hartalega

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001708.jsp?ftp=266","Jul 15, 2020 12:23 AM","Luster95","Haiz those who saying that when the glove factory is done, vaccine is ready, covid is disappear. Yes, it does make sense
So my questions
1) glove order is made by daily/monthly/ yearly? After vaccine is ready can straight cancel? If order is made
2) how confidence you are, that vaccine will be ready in 3 to 6 mnth?
3) how long do you think anzo need to build/ acquire the facilities?
Simple la, the co know the trend, and will try as fast as possible to jump in the trend. If there is no benefits why to do so? Tis is their co strategy not just bluffing
Also, from the biz background, this co is not purely relying on the glove acquisition kayy, just trying to increase one revenue stream which has high potential in nowadays trend.
Last but not least, there is also new copper deal . I believe It wont fall below 0.12 , bad days has passed. You can consider sell once it touch 0.18+O Dont forget about the fundamental when you are making losses, which i expect this share value can be at 0.1+. Those chase high sell at this point is not wise, Now is consolidation phase, support at 0.12 , tp 0.2+ , above 0.2 can str8 sell
Anyhow, trade at your own risk , goodluck guys"

Moderna’s potential vaccine to prevent Covid-19 produced neutralizing antibodies in all ""45"" patients in its early stage human trial, according to newly released data.

To recap, last month MQTech had hogged the limelight following a news report published by The New Straits Times that it was a front runner, alongside Top Glove Corp Bhd, to acquire glove manufacturer Latexx Partners.
In a statement today, MQTech said its unit Microlead Manufacturing Sdn Bhd inked the deal with JD to expand their businesses and jointly cooperate to acquire the glove company, which it did not name, via the JV.

It said MQTech and JD will subscribe and participate in the capital of the JV company at all times in the proportions of 30% and 70%.
MQTech said JD is currently engaged in the trading business with revenue of around RM639 million to RM1.28 billion per annum in the recent years and is in possession of extensive know-how and technical information concerning the manufacturing of personal safety apparels including nitrile rubber glove.
JD chairman Datuk Muzamir Mustafa said the company has flown more than 350 metric tonnes of rubber gloves, which it sources from local manufacturers to Europe alone in the past few months.
""On the back of our track record, several local banks have shown strong interest to participate in the acquisition exercise of a glove factory and currently we are negotiating with four glove companies before we conclude the acquisition in one or two weeks,” he said.
Meanwhile, MQTech executive director Terence Cheah Eu Lee said the negotiation for the glove company is at an advanced stage at the moment.
""More information will be announced to keep our shareholders informed in a timely manner,” he said.
MQTech said it will be entitled to increase its participation in the equity capital of the JV company by another 30% by acquiring 30% of equity capital held by JD at fair market value in due course.
MQTech, whose core business specialises in high-precision moulds and magnetic coils for hard disk drives, has been loss-making for the past five years.
The company slipped deeper into the red for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2019, with a net loss of RM7.48 million, from RM5.22 million for the previous financial year. Its annual revenue shrank to RM9.65 million from RM24.65 million.
At midday break, MQTech was unchanged at 8.5 sen, valuing it at RM60.91 million with 53.69 million shares done."

This bullshit worse than through the grapevine, this sounds more thru graveyard. It's exactly meant to dig your hole to bury.
Local glove companies are in a race to produce more medical or nitrile gloves to meet global demand and joining the race soon will be Mlabs Systems Bhd (Mlabs).
We just heard from the market that Mlabs is working closely with one company, whom we think might be an existing glove manufacturer to help ramp up glove production in response to the global shortage brought about by the COVID-19."

(""PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF ASSETS"")
1) It was disclosed that your Company has yet to conduct a market valuation on the Assets and is in the midst of
examining the production capacity of the Assets. Given the above, please provide the basis and justification on
how you can derive at the purchase consideration of RM55 million with certainty.
The basis to derive at the purchase consideration of RM55 million was based on the following:
i) Primary on Vendors’ representations that all production facilities are readily to be mobilised to produce
RM100 million pieces of medical/nitrile gloves per month and the location of the industrial property.
ii) The outlook and prospects of the glove industry. Demand for medical gloves has reached unprecedented
levels as the pandemic has spread globally. In view of the acute surge in demand, the gloves market has
turned into a seller’s market where sellers of gloves have relatively higher negotiation power in determining
pricing as well as allocating capacities.
iii) Due to reason (ii) above, the demand for readily available gloves production facility has surged substantially
and the scarcity of supplies became a seller market. The Vendor has offered RM55 million as selling price.
By signing the Term Sheet with the Vendor, Anzo intend to lock in the opportunity of getting a readily available
gloves production facility. However, the group would still engage the necessary consultants to do the due
diligence and conduct all the verifications prior to finalising the Proposed Acquisitions of Assets.
2) As your Company is still in the midst of studying the cost required to reinstate the production line, please clarify
whether there will be any adjustment to be made to the purchase consideration of RM55 million based on the
outcome of relevant due diligence and assessment by consultants to be completed within the 14 business days.
Subject to further findings and outcomes of the relevant due diligence and assessment, there could be a further
negotiation of the purchase consideration should any of the outcome deviate from the Vendors’ initial
representations.
3) Given that the Vendor is the beneficial owner of the Assets, please confirm whether the ownership of the Assets
have been registered under the name of the Vendor and the date of completion of such registration.
The assets are yet to be registered under the name of the Vendor. The date of completion and registration will
be ascertained by the due diligence to be conducted.
4) It was represented that the business to be carried out on the Assets is subject to the approvals from Department
of Environment, Majlis Tempatan Manjung, Department of Occupational Safety & Health, Bomba licence and
Department of Health and Human Services. In this regard, please incorporate the following:-
(a) date of the respective approvals, permits and/or licences obtained and their period of validity;
The details information of the respective approvals, permits and/or licenses will be ascertained by the due
diligence to be conducted."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001708.jsp?ftp=269","Jul 19, 2020 3:32 PM","dragon12345","(b) whether the abovementioned approvals, permits and/or licences are still valid following the transfer of
Assets from the Vendor to your Company. If no, please state the expected date for the submission to the
respective regulatory authorities.
The abovementioned approvals, permits/licenses are not transferable from the Vendor, Anzo will need to
resubmit and get the approvals from the respective regulatory authorities upon completion of the Proposed
Acquisition of Assets. The approvals of various permits/ licenses from the respective regulatory authorities
is expected to take approximately 3 to 6 months time.
5) Please clarify whether the production capacity of 100 million pieces of medical gloves per month is reasonable
and achievable given that only 4 out of 9 production lines are readily mobilised.
Based on initial assessment by consultants, the 4 production lines that are readily available has two production
lines for each line. Accordingly, the existing 4 production lines has the production capacity of 60 million pieces
of medical gloves per month.
Whereas, the consultants still need time to assess the other 5 production lines with single line of production
each.
Overall, the Vendor’s initial representation is the total 9 production lines have the capacity of producing 100
million pieces of medical gloves per month.
6) The assumption on the number of medical gloves contained in one carton in arriving at the average selling price
of USD 70 per carton.
The assumption is 1,000 pieces per carton
7) Given that it is the intention of your Company to export the Products to overseas, please clarify whether the
Company has identified or secured any order of medical and/or nitrile gloves from any customers from Europe
and United States or any other country.
Since the announcement, the group has already received enquiries from prospective customers, both local and
overseas, to purchase for all the coming production capacity of medical gloves.
This announcement is dated 13 July 2020."

I am just like you, has been holding on to Anzo and waiting, waiting, ....
since I last purchased it.
I am keeping the hope alive. Wait till 30-July and see how.
In fact, another reason why I still believe ANZO will fly is because of
copper price.
You see, ANZO is now in the copper scrap business, supplying copper
scrap to South Korea (and I read some news even saying supplying
copper scrap to India too !!).
Recently, copper price has shoot up and go up a lot, because of demand
from China, and also because the South America (like Chile, Peru)
copper mines are not producing so much copper, because of Covid-19
virus spreading in Chile & Peru.
So if copper price keeps on going up, this will be good news for ANZO.
Due to above few reasons (copper price and Glove business), I am just
like you, still holding on to ANZO. I am planning to keep ANZO for mid to
long term. I am sure long term wise, ANZO will sure fly."

Thank you for supporting me.
Yes, you are right. I just checked ANZO quarterly result/report just now,
and indeed ANZO reports a huge revenue increase in the recent Q1
(compared to previous few quarters). Also, I observed there is no loss
being reported for Q1 (I look at the EPS, ""Earning per share"" data).
I guess if ANZO can keep up with this momentum, then there is no harm
for me to hold/keep ANZO shares.
Share market is a very realistic place ... if a company performs well
financially, then its share price will surely go up accordingly.
Hopefully next quarter result will be even better. I will continue to hold/
keep ANZO shares, even though the glove deal is terminated now."

Just curious ... I want to ask you whether do you know how ANZO
can achieve such a huge jump in revenue in the latest/recent
reported quarterly result? They also report some profits, I notice
the profits under the ""NP"" column (I guess ""NP"" stands for
'Net Profit').
What business did ANZO do that make ANZO achieve such a
huge jump in revenue in the latest/last/recent reported quarterly
result?"

蔡文杰是另一家上公司安卓控股（ANZO 9342）的董事经理兼大股东，蔡氏出价每股30仙，以全面收购海外天集团，完成收购後，他要保持海外天的创业板上市地位。
蔡文杰提出的30仙收购价格，较海外天暂停交易前的31.5仙，折价1.5仙或4.76%，不过比海外天的三个月平均价格溢价24.07%。
早前财经周刊THE EDGE有报导丹斯里林晓春有参与收购海外天集团，不过，今日该周刊向林晓春公司提出询问时，林晓春表示拒绝评论。
海外天集团在过去三个财政年都蒙受亏损，2018年亏490万令吉，2019年亏450万令吉，2020年亏550万令吉。

What is the difference between investing and speculation?
Benjamin Graham addressed the differences between them on the very first page of his book, The Intelligent Investor.
Graham wrote, ""An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return.""
Based on this definition, there are three components to investing:
thorough analysis,
safety of principal, and
adequate return.
Graham added, ""Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.""
To this, we can add:
(1) Any contemplated holding period shorter than a normal business cycle (typically 3 to 5 years) is speculation, and
(2) any purchase based on anticipated market movements or forecasting is also speculation.
Value investing meets Graham's definition of investing, addressing on: its focus on individual company analysis to determine intrinsic value, the margin of safety concept, and its success over the long term.
The distinction between investing and speculation is important for a reason Graham cited in 1949 and remains true today: ""... in the easy language of Wall Street, everyone who buys or sells a security has become n investor regardless of what he buys, or for what purpose, or at what price....""
The financial media often refers to ""investors"" taking profits, bargain hunting, or driving prices higher or lower on a particular day. However, these actions are rightly attributed to speculators, not investors.
Investors and speculators approach their tasks differently.
Investors want to know what a business is worth and imagine themselves as owning the business as a whole. Unlike speculators, investors maintain a long-term perspective—at least 3 to 5 years. They look at a company from the perspective of owners. This means they’re interested in factors such as corporate governance, structure, and succession issues that may affect a company’s future and its ability to create wealth for years to come. Investors may use their voting rights to assist in enhancing company value over the long term.
Speculators, on the other hand, are less interested in what a business is actually worth and more concerned with what a third party will pay to own shares on a given day. They may be concerned only with short-term changes in a stock’s price, not in the underlying value
of the company itself.
The problem with speculation is simple:
Who can predict what a third party will pay for your shares today, tomorrow, or any day?
Stock market prices typically swing between extremes, stoked by the irrational emotions of fear and greed.
Focus on the long term business value
Such dramatic price fluctuation on a day-to-day basis can test long-term investors’ mettle in maintaining their focus on business value.
Remember, the tendency is for business values day-to-day to remain relatively stable.
Day-to-day price changes should hold little interest for the long-term investor, unless a price has fallen to the “buying level” that represents a sizable margin of safety.
But that’s often difficult to remember when newspaper headlines, TV news anchors, friends, and coworkers are lamenting or lauding the market’s most recent lurch forward or back.

Anzo's copper export business hit the right spot when global demand for copper
increased tremendously .Copper price has surged 40% due to global shortage .
The insatiable demand is created by electric vehicle and its battery . One electric
vehicle needs 40 kg of copper approximately 10000 times requirement for a handset .
Demand for copper foil is expected to increase from 140000 ton to 250000 ton by 2025 .
A Tesla car need 45000 ton of copper whereas a normal car only need 18-49 pound of
copper ..A battery electric bus need 814 pounds of copper . Copper is undergoing a
massive bull market now . SK Holdings from South Korea energy and telecoms conglomerate invested 270 billion won and later 100 billion won in China's Lingbao Wason copper foil (world largest manufacturer of copper foil which is used as a negative electrode current collector in a lithium ion battery ) recently .
The number of electric vehicles is projected to increase to 17 million by 2025 and 32 million
by 2030 . Chile and Peru can only supply 8 million ton of mined copper due to disruptions by COVID 19 whereas global copper demand exceeds 28 million ton per year.The rest of it is supplied by scrap copper .
Anzo has been supplying scrap copper for export to Postco Korea through AP holder CSTME
for 45 days already starting from July 1st 2020.Based on estimates , Anzo should have
supplied around 15000 ton of copper scrap which is valued at RM 15 -18 million by now ."

Rocketing demand for EV auto parts is expected to present copper miners and refiners
a huge challenge going forward ,Research quoted in Barron's said the mining industry
need to produce 5 million tonnes of copper a month by 2030 which is 2.5 times the
amount produced this year just to meet demand from EVs .
The base metal is heading for a supply shortage by 2020 .Over 200 copper mines in
operation will be depleted in the next 15 years . Without new ones , there will be a 15 million
tonnes supply deficit by 2035 .
Tesla surged yesterday to a record USD 1835 giving a market cap of USD 342 billion
surpassing P&G ( value USD 337 billion) . Tesla's demand for nickel , cobalt and copper
is collossal .This is not counting other auto makers who are also producing EV at an
amazing speed .
Anzo's involvement in copper recycling business comes at the opportune time as scrap
copper constitutes the bulk of copper supply needed for EV industry . Investors must bear in mind that this vital aspect of Anzo's new business of copper export has not been fully reflected in the share price as yet ."

Most actively traded copper futures for delivery in September added 1.6% to $3.0230 a pound, the first time they have eclipsed the closely watched $3 level since June 2018. Many analysts think that $3 copper incentivizes miners to pursue longer-term projects to extract metal. A dearth of investment in new mines due to low prices in recent years is one reason some analysts are bullish on the industrial metal, which is used to manufacture everything from smartphones to homes."

In its independent advice circular to OEB shareholders on Bursa Malaysia today, UOB Kay Hian Securities (M) Sdn Bhd (UOBKH) recommended that shareholders accept the offer as it finds the offer “fair” and “reasonable”.
According to the independent adviser, the offer is deemed fair as the 30 sen offer price is higher than the estimated fair value per share of 21 sen, representing a premium of 42.86%, and also above the market price of OEB’s shares as at the one-month, three-month, six-month, one-year, two-year and three-year volume weighted average price (VWAP).
It also pointed out that the offer is reasonable as it provides an exit opportunity for the shareholders, especially those holding large blocks of shares, given the low trading liquidity and the absence of competing offers.
Shareholders may have limited opportunities to dispose of their offer shares in the open market, said UOBKH.
On Aug 6, OEB announced that Chai had entered into a sale and purchase agreement with five parties to buy a 62.37% stake in the group for RM45.37 million.
This triggered a mandatory takeover offer, which means that Chai has to acquire all the remaining shares not held by him, although he intends to maintain OEB’s listing status on the bourse.
The offer caused a surge in OEB’s share price to an all-time closing high of 85.5 sen on Aug 12.
At noon break today, OEB shares were unchanged at 70.5 sen, bringing a market capitalisation of RM170.97 million. A total of 38,300 shares were traded.

1) It was disclosed that your Company has yet to conduct a market valuation on the Assets and is in the midst of examining the production capacity of the Assets. Given the above, please provide the basis and justification on how you can derive at the purchase consideration of RM55 million with certainty.
The basis to derive at the purchase consideration of RM55 million was based on the following:
i) Primary on Vendors’ representations that all production facilities are readily to be mobilised to produce RM100 million pieces of medical/nitrile gloves per month and the location of the industrial property.
ii) The outlook and prospects of the glove industry. Demand for medical gloves has reached unprecedented levels as the pandemic has spread globally. In view of the acute surge in demand, the gloves market has turned into a seller’s market where sellers of gloves have relatively higher negotiation power in determining pricing as well as allocating capacities.
iii) Due to reason (ii) above, the demand for readily available gloves production facility has surged substantially and the scarcity of supplies became a seller market. The Vendor has offered RM55 million as selling price.
By signing the Term Sheet with the Vendor, Anzo intend to lock in the opportunity of getting a readily available gloves production facility. However, the group would still engage the necessary consultants to do the due diligence and conduct all the verifications prior to finalising the Proposed Acquisitions of Assets.
2) As your Company is still in the midst of studying the cost required to reinstate the production line, please clarify whether there will be any adjustment to be made to the purchase consideration of RM55 million based on the outcome of relevant due diligence and assessment by consultants to be completed within the 14 business days.
Subject to further findings and outcomes of the relevant due diligence and assessment, there could be a further negotiation of the purchase consideration should any of the outcome deviate from the Vendors’ initial representations.
3) Given that the Vendor is the beneficial owner of the Assets, please confirm whether the ownership of the Assets have been registered under the name of the Vendor and the date of completion of such registration.
The assets are yet to be registered under the name of the Vendor. The date of completion and registration will be ascertained by the due diligence to be conducted.
4) It was represented that the business to be carried out on the Assets is subject to the approvals from Department of Environment, Majlis Tempatan Manjung, Department of Occupational Safety"

独立顾问大华继显研究指出，根据加总估值法，海外天的估值为每股21仙，较献议价高42.86%。
流通低宜套现
同时，献议价也比5日、1个月、3个月、6个月和1年交易量加权均价（VWAP），溢价1.63%至38.50%。
另外，海外天的股票流动性不足，平均每月流通率仅为1.26%；因此，全面收购可为投资者创造套现的机会。
大华继显研究也特别提到，截至9月1日闭市，海外天的股价为每股73仙，较献议价为高。因此，若股票流动性足够，投资者在公开市场中出售股价可获得更高受益。
蔡文杰是于上个月大举买入海外天62.37%股权，触发强制全面收购，进而献议以每股30仙收购海外天其余股权。
当时海外天的创办人兼董事经理俞植昌与其他大股东，以4537万7697令吉或每股30仙，将1亿5125万8992股，卖给蔡文杰。"

Hundreds of thousands have been given Chinese COVID-19 vaccines without a single infection
CGTN
￼
Hundreds of thousands of people have been given two Chinese COVID-19 vaccine candidates as part of an emergency program, without a single case of infection or adverse effects, a senior official of a state-owned vaccine developer has said.
The two vaccines, developed by China National Biotec Group (CNBG), are expected to enter the market as soon as December, said Zhou Song, the company's general legal counsel.
They can protect people against the novel coronavirus for one to three years, and two shots will cost less than 1,000 yuan (about 146 U.S. dollars), according to Zhou.
The two vaccines are still undergoing phase three trials for safety and efficacy in several countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Peru, Morocco, Argentina and Jordan.
The emergency program was launched in late July, which allows ""high-risk"" groups to be vaccinated, such as medical workers, diplomats and people who worked in foreign countries still struggling with the pandemic.

In fact, Rakuten's head of research Kenny Yee told a virtual media briefing today that the online broker expects trading interest in the local equities market to continue to be fueled by retail investors in the coming months.
Retail interest, he noted, hit its peak in August with a participation rate of 43.18% in the local bourse, up from its March low of 25.97%, before cooling down to 40.79% this month. The surge of interest was most obvious in April and May, as retail investors rode the rubber glove ""fever"", Yee said.
So far this year, retail participation is up 132% compared with the average seen in 2019, he said. As a result, the average daily trading volume in the local bourse is about 7 billion shares now, compared with last year's average of 2.5 billion shares.
￼
The flood of retail-driven liquidity has led the FBM KLCI to rebound from its March low of 1,219.72 to its peak of 1,611.42 this year on July 29.
Today, the benchmark index closed 6.51 points or 0.43% higher at 1,511.36 points, still up almost 24% from its March low. Rakuten has projected that the FBM KLCI will close at 1,580 points by the end of this year.
The loan moratorium was first announced by Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin in March under the government's PRIHATIN Rakyat Economic Stimulus Package, to ease the financial burden faced by small and medium enterprises, as well as individuals who have been affected by the Covid-19 outbreak.
Rakuten's top picks: AHB, D'nonce and Scomnet
Meanwhile, Rakuten Trade's top fundamentals picks are office furniture manufacturer AHB Holdings Bhd (target price (TP): 61 sen), engineering solutions provider D’nonce Technology Bhd (TP: 88 sen), and Supercomnet Technologies Bhd (Scomnet)(TP:RM2.68) — a manufacturer of wires and cable for medical devices, electrical appliance, consumer electronics and automotive markets.
All three stocks are deemed to be beneficiaries of the Covid-19 theme. For AHB, Rakuten said it is set to benefit from the introduction of its latest products, namely “Covid Panels” and “SpaceCom Medical Hubs” — products that are designed for the office space and medical hubs for Covid-19 prevention. The group is expected to achieve record earnings in its financial year ending Sept 2021 (FY21), according to Rakuten Trade.
Covid Panels are basically glass panel separators in the office space, while its SpaceCom Medical Hubs are mobile medical hubs specially designed to prevent infectious diseases, as they are constructed with negative pressure antivirus high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration and ventilation systems.
Similarly, the research house expects D’nonce to achieve record earnings in FY21, as the group's packaging boxes are being used by major glove manufacturers including Top Glove Corp Bhd.
Rakuten Trade, meanwhile, favours Scomnet for its robust earnings growth outlook, on the back of improved demand for medical cables amid the pandemic. It also expects the group to deliver its strongest-ever performance on record with earnings per share anticipated to jump by 59% in its current financial year ending Dec 31, 2020, with a further 68.3% growth in FY21.
Scomnet's major clients, it noted, are US-based Edward Lifesciences, and Denmark-based Ambu and Mermaid Medical — both of which are global cardiovascular medical devices companies.
Today, AHB's shares closed one sen or 4.76% higher at 22 sen for a market capitalisation of RM52.86 million, while D’nonce settled 0.5 sen or 0.86% higher at 58.5 sen, which valued the company at RM160.34 million. Scomnet ended the day one sen or 0.51% higher at RM1.98, for a market capitalisation of RM1.28 billion.

Sources said the company might announce the potential deal as early as next week.
It is believed that Anzo will start exporting the copper scrap to Japan and South Korea effective next month via a company with an AP (approved permit) licence.
The contract will create new business opportunities for Anzo in the export markets, said sources with knowledge on the matter.

The stock traded heavily yesterday, rising as much as 5.5 sen just after midday, before closing the day at 14 sen.
Some 232.4 million shares changed hands.
Anzo was one of the most active stocks traded on Bursa Malaysia.
The potential copper contract will be the second major win for Anzo this year.
In June, Anzo won a RM1.3 billion contract to supply copper scrap indirectly to a steel-making group in South Korea effective from July 1.
Anzo, which is being looked at by global funds from Hong Kong and China, had entered into a supply agreement with CSTME Resources Sdn Bhd, one of the major importers and exporters of non-ferrous materials in Malaysia.
In a recent filing with Bursa, Anzo had said that it would supply up to 60,000 tonnes of copper scrap to CSTME at RM23,000 per tonne over 40 months.
It is unclear if Anzo will also work with CSTME, which has an AP licence, for the new job.
Anzo, which is involved in property development and timber products, had in the last two years been actively seeking new business to diversify its income stream after posting losses for many quarters because of market conditions.
Its managing director Datuk Eddie Chai Woon Chet told the New Straits Times previously that Anzo was expected to turn around in the current year ending July 31, 2020.
This could be possible given that Anzo has already supplied close to 4,500 tonnes of copper to South Korea, worth about RM90 million since July 1."

(MYR0.115) Results lifted by new copper business, is the worst over?
Maybank IB Retail Research
Anzo returned to the black in 4QFY9/20, reporting a PAT of MYR0.03m vs. a LAT of MYR0.8m a year ago. This took 12MFY9/20 LAT to MYR1.3m (12MFY7/19 LAT: MYR3.5m). Note that Anzo changed its financial year end from 31 Jul 2020 to 30 Sep 2020. No dividend was declared for the quarter.
Losses narrowed in 12MFY9/20 results were mainly attributable to higher contribution from its new copper scrap trading business (reported an EBIT of MYR1.1m). Note that its timber and property divisions also recorded narrower losses on lower operating costs.
For Anzo, it is in dire need of a turnaround plan. The group has been in the red since FY10, mainly on weak demand for its timber products as well as high operating costs. Its reliance on the construction and property sectors had exposed the group to the slowdown in the economy.
That said, the recent venture into copper scrap business could pave the way for better performance ahead. Recall that in Jun 2020, the group entered into an agreement to supply up to 60,000MT of copper scrap to CSTME Resources S/B at MYR23,000/MT for 40 months (total contract: MYR1.3b).
Notwithstanding that, investors should continue to monitor Anzo’s upcoming quarterly results. Execution is key to success. In Jul 2020, the group proposed to diversify into gloves manufacturing but was called off. Its deal with Tinta Anggun Engineering to develop a hotel was also terminated.
YTD, Anzo’s share price has risen 360%. Consequently, its valuation is on the high side. At current price, the stock is trading at a P/B of 0.7x, higher than its 3-year historical average P/B of 0.4x. Warrants are not included in the BV/sh computation as they are out-of–the-money."

KUALA LUMPUR: Anzo Holdings Bhd may have bagged a new contract worth RM1.3 billion to RM1.5 billion to export copper scrap to Japan and South Korea.
Sources said the company might announce the potential deal as early as next week.
It is believed that Anzo will start exporting the copper scrap to Japan and South Korea effective next month via a company with an AP (approved permit) licence.
The contract will create new business opportunities for Anzo in the export markets, said sources with knowledge on the matter.
The stock traded heavily yesterday, rising as much as 5.5 sen just after midday, before closing the day at 14 sen.
Some 232.4 million shares changed hands.
Anzo was one of the most active stocks traded on Bursa Malaysia.
The potential copper contract will be the second major win for Anzo this year.
In June, Anzo won a RM1.3 billion contract to supply copper scrap indirectly to a steel-making group in South Korea effective from July 1.
Anzo, which is being looked at by global funds from Hong Kong and China, had entered into a supply agreement with CSTME Resources Sdn Bhd, one of the major importers and exporters of non-ferrous materials in Malaysia.
In a recent filing with Bursa, Anzo had said that it would supply up to 60,000 tonnes of copper scrap to CSTME at RM23,000 per tonne over 40 months.
It is unclear if Anzo will also work with CSTME, which has an AP licence, for the new job.
Anzo, which is involved in property development and timber products, had in the last two years been actively seeking new business to diversify its income stream after posting losses for many quarters because of market conditions.
Its managing director Datuk Eddie Chai Woon Chet told the New Straits Times previously that Anzo was expected to turn around in the current year ending July 31, 2020.
This could be possible given that Anzo has already supplied close to 4,500 tonnes of copper to South Korea, worth about RM90 million since July 1."

KUALA LUMPUR (Sept 17): At the price of 30 sen per share, Datuk Chai Woon Chet seemed to have made an attractive mandatory takeover offer (MTO) to the minority shareholders of Oversea Enterprise Bhd (OEB) given the restaurant chain’s share price had never traded at that high level since it was listed in April 2010.
Nonetheless, Chai’s MGO, which closed at 5pm today, only received 500 shares. It is not hard to fathom the low acceptance for the offer. OEB's share price rocketed to a record high of 86 sen on Aug 12 — nearly triple of Chai’s offer price — six days after the takeover offer was launched.
OEB share price retreated from the peak since then, hovering in the range between 69 sen and 79 sen. Still, the stock price was substantially higher than Chai’s offer.
Besides the takeover offer, there is no other material announcement made by the company. Nonetheless, the stock just rallied."

The Edge Malaysia/The Edge Malaysia
September 30, 2020 14:00 pm +08
https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/special-report-hidden-hands-beh...
ASTUTE market observers would have noticed on the local bourse a group of individuals, supposedly acting in concert, who have amassed shares in more than 20 publicly traded companies. These companies — linked via shareholding and directorships — are often on the most actively traded list, with huge, fluctuating share prices.
“It (the companies) is all linked to the same person; usually, the most actively traded list on a daily basis involves these counters,” one source says when asked which are the companies that are linked.
However, research by The Edge (see chart on the 21 companies) indicates that while other businessmen have surfaced, the individual said to be in control of the group of companies is not officially onboard or present as a shareholder.
“This [his not surfacing] could be due to several issues,” another source adds.
It is also telling that nine of the 21 companies mentioned — AT Systemization Bhd, MLabs Systems Bhd, Focus Dynamics Group Bhd, mTouche Technology Bhd, Fintec Global Bhd, XOX Bhd, M3Technologies (Asia) Bhd and NetX Holdings Bhd — have their principal place of business, head office, business office or corporate office in Menara Lien Hoe, near Tropicana Golf Country Resort in Petaling Jaya. On its website, Lambo Group Bhd states that its address is at Menara Lien Hoe, even though the address in its annual report is in Old Klang Road in Kuala Lumpur.
In 2006, Lien Hoe Corp Bhd sold Lien Hoe Tower Sdn Bhd, which owns Menara Lien Hoe, to privately held E-Globalfocus Sdn Bhd for RM1 and the assumption of RM43 million in debts.
Meanwhile, E-Globalfocus was 68%-controlled by Cubes Innovative Sdn Bhd, a company 99%-controlled by Chuah Hock Soon. Chuah and businessman Datuk Kenneth Vun @ Vun Yun Lun were charged with four others in July 2014 for allegedly manipulating DVM Technology Bhd shares in March 2006.
Vun has had several issues with the Securities Commission Malaysia and, in 2009, had to restitute RM2.496 million — being the amount of company funds that he had caused to be misused for his personal benefit, according to the regulator — to his then flagship FTEC Resources Bhd.
Since FTEC — which morphed into Tecasia Bhd and later Mangotone Bhd — was delisted, Vun has had little direct presence in the market. However, Vun’s two sisters, Carol Vun On Nei and Grace Vun Siaw Nei, hold stakes of 3.64% and 0.67% respectively in Xidelang Holdings Ltd.
Fragmented shareholding
While Fintec Global seems to be a prominent company at the centre of the maze, its shareholding is fragmented, with several blocks of shares parked under Sanston Financial Group Ltd. In several of the 21 companies on the list, Sanston Financial is present in the shareholding list.
Other companies that surface as shareholders in these list of companies include Global Prime Partners Ltd and Cita Realiti Sdn Bhd, a private company wholly-owned by one Kamarudin Khalil.
Other shareholders, albeit usually holding small stakes, among the 21 companies include Datuk Jacky Pang Chow Huat — who, apart from a 11.84% stake in Sanichi Technology Bhd — has small stakes in DGB Asia Bhd, Focus Dynamics, MNC Wireless Bhd and Xidelang. Pang is also a director in Sanichi Technology.
Meanwhile, businessman Mak Siew Wei has 23.4% in AT Systemization, 17.07% in Green Ocean Corp Bhd and small stakes in Focus Dynamics and Xidelang. He is also a director at AT Systemization, Green Ocean and Saudee Group Bhd.
Datuk Eddie Chai Woon Chet recently acquired a 62.37% stake in restaurant operator Oversea Enterprise Bhd, and has a 6.71% shareholding in Anzo Holdings Bhd, where he is managing director and has a board position in M3Technologies (Asia). Another name frequently seen is Datuk Kua Khai Shyuan, who, besides a 5.9% stake in mTouche Technology, has small shareholdings in Focus Dynamics, PDZ Holdings Bhd and Sanichi Technology, and has board seats on Trive Property Bhd, DGB Asia and MNC Wireless.
Former Umno treasurer and former Bank Simpanan Nasional Bhd chairman Datuk Abdul Azim Mohd Zabidi surfaces as a director in four of the companies — Fintec Global, DGB Asia, Anzo and XOX.
Most of the companies are loss-making and small in terms of market capitalisation, with the exception of Focus Dynamics, which has a market value exceeding RM5 billion. Nevertheless, Focus Dynamics, which is involved in operating food and beverage outlets, seems to be the star performer, with its stock price hitting a multiple-year high of RM2.64 recently on Sept 17, despite mustering a meagre RM3.08 million in net profit from RM20.72 million in revenue for its six months ended June this year.
Year to date, Focus Dynamics stock has gained about 400%.

For cash-strapped corporates, private placements can allow them to raise cash quickly through dealing directly with investors, even though they may get lower valuations than via the public markets.
KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia’s corporates are turning to private share placements to raise funds as demand for public listings of bonds and stocks wanes and banks cut back on their lending.
The Southeast Asian nation’s stock exchange saw 151 deals in the first nine months of the year, compared with 76 in the same period of 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Volumes jumped 25% to 1.41 billion ringgit ($339 million), the data show.
For cash-strapped corporates, private placements can allow them to raise cash quickly through dealing directly with investors, even though they may get lower valuations than via the public markets. The fund-raising situation has become more acute as Malaysia’s export-driven economy contracted the most since the 1998 Asia financial crisis amid the pandemic.
Coupled with falling commodity prices, a shrinking economy has put a strain on corporate earnings and cash flows. Many of the companies doing private placements had losses in the recent quarter and will likely remain weak in coming months, said Bharat Joshi, an investment director who oversees the Southeast Asian region at PT Aberdeen Standard Investments Indonesia.
Tighter Funding
""Banks are unlikely to extend credit to these companies, which results in them raising from private placements instead of paying a hefty premium in the bond market, ” said Jakarta-based Joshi.
Companies in Malaysia aren’t alone in facing a tighter funding situation: some Indonesian publicly listed firms have also been resorting to rights offers and private share placements.

Malaysian corporates were only able to raise 4.15 billion ringgit on the local stock exchange through primary and secondary offerings as of Sept. 30, a 43% drop from the comparable period in 2019. Bond sales in all currencies fell 13% to $28 billion.
""Private placement shall continue to be an attractive avenue to raise funds for public-listed companies, subject to availability of investors, regardless of the equity-market conditions, ” said Roslan Hj Tik, Kuala Lumpur-based executive director at Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd. - Bloomberg"

Anzo Group is principally involved in investment holding, provision of management service, property development, construction and trading of construction materials, provision of marketing services, provision of timber processing services, timber kiln drying, sawmilling and marketing sawn timber (“Existing Business”). The Group has recently rationalised its business activities to improve operation’s efficiency whereby Anzo Trading will be the trading arm of the Group’s trading business to undertake the trading of construction materials and copper scrap.

world’s industrial raw material needs. Worldwide, manufacturers consume about 900 million MT
of scrap each year. About 20% of that volume, or nearly 180 million MT, is a result of global trade
in scrap.
Recyclers categorise metal scrap as ferrous, made from iron and steel or nonferrous, which includes
aluminium, copper, lead, zinc, nickel, and tin. Precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum
also are commonly recycled nonferrous metals.
Copper remains a vital commodity used in construction, electrical equipment, transportation,
consumer goods, and other products. Copper combines well with other metals, such as tin, lead, and
zinc, to form metal alloys. Bronze and brass are two of the most common copper alloys, but
hundreds of others have been created for the specific properties they can provide.
Scrap prices are subject to many of the same market forces as primary (virgin) commodity prices,
thus they experience similar price volatility. Domestic and global manufacturing demand, changes
in currency markets, transportation supply and prices, energy prices, trade barriers, and the cost and
availability of comparable virgin commodities are all factors that can affect the price of scrap
commodities.
China and Hong Kong purchased 35% of U.S. copper scrap in 2018, compared with 72% in 2017.
Other important overseas markets for U.S. copper scrap exports in 2018 included Malaysia (up
2,053% from 2017, to 119,573 MT), Canada (down 1.5%), South Korea (up 129%), Japan (up
165%), and India (up 94%).
(Source: Recycling Industry Yearbook 2019, ISRI)
China is short of copper scrap. This is largely a problem of its own making. China has steadily
restricted imports of a material of officially designated as “waste” during its broader war on
pollution. Beijing had intended to ban all copper scrap imports in the same way it has already locked
out other forms of “foreign garbage” such as used plastic. The government has since relented under
pressure from its own copper sector, which was panicking about the loss of a major component of
China’s copper supply chain. Imports of higher-grade copper scrap have been reclassified from
“waste” to “resource”. Other things being equal, China’s copper scrap imports would be expected
to recover from their depressed levels to fill any gap.
China’s imports of U.S. copper scrap imploded to 89,000 tonnes last year from 352,000 tonnes in
2018, according to the country's customs department. What the United States used to ship to China
it now sends to Malaysia, the hub of a new off-shore industry converting lower-grade scrap to
Chinese import specifications. U.S. exports to Malaysia mushroomed from 120,000 tonnes in 2018
to 221,000 tonnes last year, according to International Trade Centre figures. In 2015, the export
flow to Malaysia totalled just 613 tonnes. This is a redirection of lower-grade material once destined
for China or its back door in Hong Kong. Last year’s shipments from the U.S. to Malaysia had an
average content of 31%. Malaysian processors dismantle and clean this material before purifying
it into a form of copper that meets Beijing’s new “resource” thresholds. Malaysia has emerged as
the largest supplier of copper scrap to China, accounting for 18% of total imports last year. The
calculated content of the material averaged a high 89%. It is, however, simply U.S. supply in
disguise. The world’s biggest exporter is still shipping to China but, thanks to Chinese scrap and
trade policy, now via Malaysia."

2) a diversification into the trading of industrial materials and related business; and
3) a conditional supply agreement between Anzo’s wholly-owned subsidiary Anzo Trading S/B and CSTME Resources S/B to supply copper scrap as per the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries’ specifications.

almost 15 times respectively compared to the previous year’s corresponding period. This was mainly
due to the contribution made from the new copper scrap trading business from the trading division,
which provided RM15.6 million (2019 4Qtr: nil) turnover during the quarter.
The timber division was badly affected by the Movement Control Order (MCO) which came into effect
from March 2020. This was evidenced by its contribution of only RM0.7 million (2019 4Qtr: RM1.5
million) turnover during the period.
In line with the improved operating results, the Group achieved a small Profit before tax of RM0.02
million compared to a Loss Before Tax of RM0.8 million in the previous year’s corresponding quarter.

KUALA LUMPUR: Bursa Malaysia stayed in the red the whole of Monday as investors worried about the impact of fresh curbs imposed by the government to curb the spread of the Covid-19.
At 5pm, the KLCI was down 11.92 points or 0.78% to 1,518.43. Turnover was 5.97 billion shares valued at RM3.82bil. There were 498 gainers, 573 losers and 400 counters unchanged.
In late afternoon, Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob announced that Selangor, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya will be placed under the conditional movement control order (MCO) from this Wednesday until Oct 27.
Under the CMCO, most industries will be allowed to operate normally but schools, daycares, places of worship, parks, sporting activities, social activities, weddings and entertainment outlets are off-limits. However, inter-district travel is only allowed for work purposes with proper identification issued by employers.
On the global front, more than 37.42 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 1,074,688​ have died, according to a Reuters tally.

KUALA LUMPUR (Oct 13): The government will sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with China to ensure Malaysia will be among the first to receive the Covid-19 vaccine from the country once it is, as expected, successfully developed by end of the year.
Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said that through talks between Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein and his visiting Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, China has agreed to list Malaysia as a priority recipient of the vaccine after it completes clinical trials.
""I am quite pleased with this guarantee and I have asked that this cooperation be inked in the form of an MoU to be made with China,"" he told a press conference at his residence in Putrajaya today.
Muhyiddin said the government has also agreed to join the Covid-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility, a global partnership that can help developing nations obtain vaccines for Covid-19 and other diseases.
Muhyiddin said although this would involve a huge amount of money, it will not stop the government from obtaining the supply from vaccine suppliers from other sources.
Meanwhile, Muhyiddin reiterated the importance of obeying the quarantine orders and that neither he nor his ministers are exempted from complying with the standard operating procedures set by the Ministry of Health (MoH).
""There are no double standards in terms of imposing whatever has been done... whether it is Act 342 or any other law. (The) law can't differentiate between a minister and an ordinary person. If they do something wrong, they will be hit by the law, the appropriate punishment will be meted out, must be meted out,"" he said.
Touching on the third wave of Covid-19 infections that the country is currently facing, Muhyiddin said the government is adopting the best strategy to curb the spread of the virus, including in terms of spending.
""We spend prudently. Applications from the MoH for any matters... I approve them 100% and this is an important step for us to implement, seeing how the number of cases in Selangor and Sabah has increased.
""We are taking proactive steps to curb the pandemic. But if the situation worsens, there will be other measures that we will take to help the people. What we are doing now is to ensure there is no lockdown.
""Many of those involved in the economic sector do not want another MCO (Movement Control Order), a restriction which clearly had a big impact on the nation's economy,"" he said.
The prime minister is currently undergoing a 14-day self-quarantine at his residence, beginning from Oct 5.
This is because he had chaired a special meeting of the National Security Council, which was also attended by Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Religious Affairs) Datuk Seri Dr Zulkifli Mohamad Al-Bakri.
Zulkifli tested positive for Covid-19 last Monday and is undergoing treatment at a hospital in Seremban."

Anzo returned to the black in 4QFY9/20, reporting a PAT of MYR0.03m vs. a LAT of MYR0.8m a year ago. This took 12MFY9/20 LAT to MYR1.3m (12MFY7/19 LAT: MYR3.5m). Note that Anzo changed its financial year end from 31 Jul 2020 to 30 Sep 2020. No dividend was declared for the quarter.
Losses narrowed in 12MFY9/20 results were mainly attributable to higher contribution from its new copper scrap trading business (reported an EBIT of MYR1.1m). Note that its timber and property divisions also recorded narrower losses on lower operating costs.
That said, the recent venture into copper scrap business could pave the way for better performance ahead. Recall that in Jun 2020, the group entered into an agreement to supply up to 60,000MT of copper scrap to CSTME Resources S/B at MYR23,000/MT for 40 months (total contract: MYR1.3b).
At current price, the stock is trading at average P/B of 0.4x+."

（吉隆坡14日讯）先进资讯（AIM，0122，创业板）宣布，接获安卓控股（ANZO，9342，主板工业股）董事经理拿督蔡文杰有条件自愿收购献议，愿以每股13仙收购前者股权。
该公司今日向交易所报备，拿督蔡文杰尚未持有先进资讯股权；目前，该公司已发行股总数达2亿4196万8166股。
文告补充，这项股权收购献议取决于一项条件，即在献议结束时，蔡文杰须获得先进资讯超过50%的股权。
另外，13仙的献议价，等同于过去5天到1年的交易量加权均价（VWAP）的折价0.61%至44.66%，或折价0.08仙到10.49仙之间。
根据文告，从9月算起的过去1年，先进资讯股票每月在市场上的流动率，介于0.04%到0.71%，平均流动率仅0.15%。
有意维持上市地位
献议完成后，蔡文杰有意维持先进资讯的上市地位。
在8月6日，蔡文杰曾大举买入海外天（OVERSEA，0153，创业板）62.37%股权，触发强制全面收购（MGO），从而献议以每股30仙收购余下股权。
配合这项进展，先进资讯股价从下午3点32分开始暂停，直到明早复市，今日最后作价为17仙，共走高30.77%或4仙，成交量达4000股。"

KUALA LUMPUR (Oct 14): XOX Bhd, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, XOX (Hong Kong) Limited has acquired 117,848,500 ordinary shares in Nexion Technologies Limited (Nexion), representing 16.37% of the company’s issued and paid-up share capital, for RM23 million.
In a filing with Bursa Malaysia, XOX said the acquisition was acquired today via delivery by transfer.
“The aggregate cost of investment of XOX in Nexion, within the period of 12 months immediately preceding from Oct 14, 2020, was RM23,183,138.
“The cash consideration of RM23,183,138 for the acquisition was based on the prevailing market price of Nexion at the time of purchase and funded via internally-generated funds,” it said.
The acquisition would benefit XOX in increasing its capability to secure the network, addressing cybersecurity challenges, and generate new revenue streams by reselling Nexion products to XOX’s customer.
Nexion, an information and communication technology solution provider, is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange GEM Board, focusing on the provision of cyberinfrastructure and cybersecurity solutions in Southeast Asia through Software as a Service (SaaS) model.
Meanwhile, XOX Bhd group chief executive officer Ng Kok Heng said the acquisition is in line with the group’s direction to go into micro-financing, blockchain technology and content-based assets.
“It would also potentially allow us to have a pricing advantage over competitor products, and Nexion allows us to spearhead the international growth of XOX,” he added."

The activities of these so-called investment gurus have been more prevalent with the ease of information through social media outlets.
These gurus can promote or market any type of investments ranging from property, stocks, commodities or currencies in the foreign exchange market.
This has prompted a statement to be issued by the Securities Commission (SC) which warned that it is unlawful for anyone to give investment advice without a licence.
This is an offence under securities laws and may, upon conviction, attract punishment of a fine not exceeding RM10mil or imprisonment not exceeding 10 years or both.
In a report, the SC said any investment advice, whether through formal channels such as analyst reports or social media platforms such as Facebook and Telegram, is considered one of the seven regulated activities under the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007 (CMSA).
“Anyone conducting such activities will need to have a valid licence issued by the SC, ” the regulator said.
The laws notwithstanding, there appears to be a lack of enforcement in this area by the regulators.
Founder and managing director of fee-only certified financial planner MyFP Services Sdn Bhd Robert Foo warns everyone against being gullible when getting advice from self-proclaimed gurus.
“Many people will proclaim to be a guru when they know little about a particular area, ” Foo told StarBiz.
“Many people may know a bit more than me in certain areas of investments but can they meet my needs or achieve my investment goals? This must be considered. It doesn’t matter what guru they may claim to be, ” he said.
Foo said that it is important to take note if a certain person is a licensed investment adviser. “If they are unlicensed then there should be a big question mark. Many people may think they have knowledge in a particular area but in real life it’s not just about knowledge, ” he said.
“In real life it’s having knowledge and knowing how to apply this knowledge: this is called practice and practising is more important, ” Foo added.
Foo highlighted that whenever any financial product is introduced or marketed, that there would be commission payments involved.
Meanwhile, for some others, they may not receive commissions directly but they benefit indirectly since the products they introduced is likely to be the introducer’s client for their other business interests or their family’s business interests.
“You have to know that nobody else is paying the commission: only you (the purchaser of a financial product). There are many gurus who are talking so when these people talk: they are selling something and helping a particular company, ” Foo said.
“It’s okay if people want to sell you things, and you are willing to buy from them. But you have to ask yourself, does it make sense to you or in achieving your goals?” he added.
Foo also noted that some gurus may have more knowledge in a subject matter and people may actually also learn something from them.
“If they say they are guru, which areas are they an expert in? Bear in mind, don’t simply trust someone just because they claim themselves to be a guru, ” he said."

Buy-out news or merger rumors can send the price of penny stock companies higher. This is good for investors who already have a share in the company. In order to take advantage of similar events, investors keep an eye on larger, established blue-chip firms that are looking to buy up a penny stock company at its initial stage. Similar companies in the same industry, or companies with complementary business objectives or products, eventually can decide to merge together.
Marketing Push
Another technique used to evaluate penny stocks is the Leeds Analysis. Part of this analysis looks at the company’s marketing strategy. Examples are the company’s brand awareness, its positioning in the industry and how well it is differentiated from other products. Investors who are aware of the company can dedicate time to research and then buy the stock. The effect on the stock price is compounded as investors flock in droves to buy up the cheap, familiar stock."

Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 4.9% in July-September from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday, slower than the median 5.2% forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll and following 3.2% growth in the second quarter.
BEIJING: China stepped up its economic recovery in the third quarter from the Covid-19 coronavirus shock but missed forecasts, pointing to continued challenges for one of the few drivers of global growth this year.
Gross domestic product (GDP) grew 4.9% in July-September from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said on Monday, slower than the median 5.2% forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll and following 3.2% growth in the second quarter.
The world's second-largest economy grew 0.7% in the first nine months from a year earlier, NBS said.
Policymakers globally are pinning their hopes on a robust recovery in China to help restart demand as economies struggle with heavy lockdowns and a second wave of coronavirus infections.
China has been steadily recovering from decades-low growth seen in the first months of the year caused by the coronavirus shock. But several recent indicators have pointed to a broader upturn in consumption as well in the third quarter.
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP rose 2.7% in July-September, the bureau said, compared with expectations for a 3.2% rise and an 11.5% rise in the previous quarter.
Industrial output grew 6.9% in September from a year earlier, after a 5.6% rise in August, while retail sales grew 3.3%, versus a 0.5% rise in August.
Fixed-asset investment rose 0.8% in the first nine months from a year earlier, after dipping 0.3% in the first eight months.
The government has rolled out a raft of measures this year, including more fiscal spending, tax relief and cuts in lending rates and banks' reserve requirements to revive the coronavirus-hit economy and support employment.
While the central bank stepped up policy support earlier this year after widespread travel restrictions choked economic activity, it has more recently held off on further easing.
The International Monetary Fund has forecast an expansion of 1.9% for China for the full year, the only major economy expected to report growth in 2020.
Premier Li Keqiang warned earlier in October that China needs to make arduous efforts to achieve its full-year economic goals, citing a complex domestic and foreign environment. - Reuters"

Anzo proposed to undertake:
1) a private placement of up to 231m new ordinary shares in Anzo representing approximately 25% of the enlarged number of issued shares;
2) a diversification into the trading of industrial materials and related business; and
3) a conditional supply agreement between Anzo’s wholly-owned subsidiary Anzo Trading S/B and CSTME Resources S/B to supply copper scrap as per the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries’ specifications.
Based on an illustrative issue price of MYR0.0932 per placement share, the group will raise up to MYR19.4m for: 1) working capital (MYR14.0m); 2) other administrative and operating expenses (MYR5.0m) and 3) expenses related to the placement exercise (MYR0.4m).
This fund raising exercise is crucial for the group as its cash & bank balances stood at only MYR6.4m as at end-Jun 2020. This compares to the initial cash outlay required for purchase of copper scrap which is estimated at up to MYR20m.
For the proposed diversification, Anzo expects the trading business to help in its turnaround. This unit helped Anzo returned to profitability in 4QFY9/20. The conditional supply agreement requires Anzo to supply up to 60,000MT copper scrap to CSTME at MYR23,000/MT for 40 months (total contract: MYR1.3b).
The new venture could reduce dependency on its existing business of timber and construction, which had dragged the group into the red since FY10, mainly on weak demand for its timber products as well as high operating costs. Meanwhile, its property venture is exposed to the slowdown in the economy."

Malaysia the new copper scrap hub
COMMODITIES
Tuesday, 19 May 2020

By Andy Home
￼
U.S. exports to Malaysia mushroomed from 120,000 tonnes in 2018 to 221,000 tonnes last year, according to International Trade Centre figures. In 2015, the export flow to Malaysia totalled just 613 tonnes.
LONDON: China is short of copper scrap. This is largely a problem of its own making. China has steadily restricted imports of a material officially designated as ""waste"" during its broader war on pollution.
Beijing had intended to ban all copper scrap imports at the end of this year in the same way it has already locked out other forms of ""foreign garbage"" such as used plastic."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001708.jsp?ftp=288","Oct 19, 2020 2:20 PM","Good123","The government has since relented under pressure from its own copper sector, which was panicking about the loss of a major component of China's copper supply chain. Imports of higher-grade copper scrap have been reclassified from ""waste"" to ""resource"".
Other things being equal, China's copper scrap imports would be expected to recover from their depressed levels to fill any gap.
However, COVID-19 has upended that assumption."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001708.jsp?ftp=288","Oct 19, 2020 2:22 PM","Good123","The coronavirus has restricted the collection and processing of scrap around the world, including in China. Lockdowns have idled manufacturing activity, halting the generation of ""new"" scrap. The copper price has slumped, reducing the value of ""old"" scrap.
China's newly-defined copper ""resource"" is one that is currently in short supply.
MINDING THE GAP
China's import volumes of copper scrap shrank to 1.5 million tonnes last year from 2.4 million in 2018 and 3.6 million in 2017, the year before Beijing launched its ""war on waste"".
Imports fell further to just 210,000 tonnes in the first quarter of this year.
Restrictions and bans on lower-quality material mean that what is now entering China is typically very high-purity scrap.
The average implied copper content of last year's imports, derived from a comparison of volumes and dollar values, surged to 78% from just over 40% in the years prior to 2018.
The purity benefit, however, doesn't offset the scale of lost tonnage. China's copper scrap gap last year looks to have been a couple of hundred thousand tonnes of contained metal. The pitfalls of the law of averaging make it difficult to quantify with precision.
But the gap was evidently wide enough for Chinese processors successfully to lobby Beijing to exclude high-grade ""resource"" from the looming ban.
China is the world's largest refiner of copper from scrap material. Such secondary production has been running in excess of 1.5 million tonnes per year for the last decade.
Imports have fed this industry. Although China's own scrap generation is rising, the intense pressure on Beijing to part-reverse its policy tells you that industry players felt domestic supply increases wouldn't be enough to compensate for the total loss of imports.
The semantic battle may have been won but now the coronavirus is restricting both domestic and overseas scrap supply further.
Multiple mine curtailments due to quarantine have simultaneously disrupted flows of copper concentrate to Chinese smelters, representing a raw materials double-whammy for the country's producers.
It's noticeable that among the measures announced by the government of Jiangxi province to support its local copper industry is a pledge to ""revitalize"" scrap import quotas and transfer any quotas held by traders to actual copper processors.
Beijing has also just suspended for one year a punitive 25% import tax on U.S. copper scrap as part of the Phase I trade deal.
That tax pretty much killed off scrap flows from what has historically been China's largest supplier.
But it's a moot point whether Beijing's latest change of scrap policy can revitalise trade between the world's two biggest economies."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001708.jsp?ftp=288","Oct 19, 2020 2:22 PM","Good123","Malaysia the new copper scrap hub
China's imports of U.S. copper scrap imploded to 89,000 tonnes last year from 352,000 tonnes in 2018, according to the country's customs department.
What was shipped was extremely high-purity material with an average implied copper content of almost 90%.
However, little of it stayed long in China. Every major U.S. shipment arriving in the third quarter last year passed customs under a ""processing with imported material"" code, implying it made no lasting impression on China's domestic scrap market.
What the United States used to ship to China it now sends to Malaysia, the hub of a new off-shore industry converting lower-grade scrap to Chinese import specifications.
U.S. exports to Malaysia mushroomed from 120,000 tonnes in 2018 to 221,000 tonnes last year, according to International Trade Centre figures. In 2015, the export flow to Malaysia totalled just 613 tonnes.
This is a redirection of lower-grade material once destined for China or its back door in Hong Kong. Last year's shipments from the United States to Malaysia had an average content of 31%, lower than any other top-10 export destination.
Malaysian processors dismantle and clean this material before purifying it into a form of copper that meets Beijing's new ""resource"" thresholds.
Malaysia has emerged as the largest supplier of copper scrap to China, accounting for 18% of total imports last year. The calculated content of the material averaged a high 89%.
It is, however, simply U.S. supply in disguise. The world's biggest exporter is still shipping to China but, thanks to Chinese scrap and trade policy, now via Malaysia.
The global supply chain has changed and probably permanently, mitigating the impact of Beijing's duty waiver."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800001708.jsp?ftp=288","Oct 19, 2020 2:23 PM","Good123","Scrap balancer
Scrap is often the hidden balancer of the copper market. During periods of oversupply and low pricing, scrap availability reduces, increasing demand for primary copper.
Thanks to COVID-19, the London copper price has tumbled from a January high of $6,343 per tonne to $5,315.
That's a sufficiently sharp fall to inhibit scrap supply. But the coronavirus is also accentuating the price effect as lockdowns freeze national collection networks and international trade flows.
Just as China has reopened its doors to copper scrap imports, even those from the United States, it's likely to find there's not much there.
The scrap gap is going to take a while to plug.
Those Chinese smelters that can will go after more copper concentrates.
That's not easy right now. The availability of concentrates was already tightening before COVID-19 as new Chinese smelters fought with incumbents for raw material. The virus has thrown supply disruption, particularly in key exporting countries such as Peru, into the mix.
This means the scrap gap will translate into stronger demand for refined metal to compensate for any loss of domestic ""secondary"" production and for a shift in input mix by fabricators that use both scrap and metal to manufacture products.
As ever with scrap, the balancing effect will be hard to see or quantify, but Beijing's recent changes of policy leave no doubt China feels it needs to start plugging the gap. - Reuters"

In early European trades, the pan-region Euro Stoxx 50 futures added 0.25%, German DAX futures were slightly higher while London's FTSE futures were down 0.07%.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.5% for its second straight day of gains, paring back slightly following third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data from China.
The index has risen in eight of the last 10 sessions amid a rally in risk assets buoyed by hopes of a coronavirus vaccine and expectations of a so-called ""blue wave"", which would see the Democrats claim victory in November's elections.
Chinese shares started higher but slipped into negative territory in afternoon trading after China's third-quarter GDP data rose 4.9%, missing expectations for a 5.2% growth.
In a positive sign, however, separate monthly indicators pointed to an expansion in economic activity.
Industrial output accelerated 6.9% in September from a year earlier, when analysts were looking for a 5.8% gain from a 5.6% rise in August.
Retail sales edged up 3.3% last month from a year earlier against expectations for 1.8% growth.
""The rebound in Q3 GDP was less strong than expected, but was still a decent 4.9% year on year. September data beat expectations, suggesting a pick-up in momentum towards the latter part of Q3,"" said Frances Cheung, head of macro strategy for Asia at Westpac in Singapore.
""The pick-up in momentum was broad based, which bodes well for the Q4 outlook."" Japan's Nikkei rose 1.1% while Australia's benchmark index added 0.9%.

KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 12): Salcon Bhd too could not resist the temptation to grab a share of the supernormal profit in the rubber glove industry.
The water and wastewater engineering firm, whose share price has more than doubled within a month, announced its plan to diversify into the glove manufacturing business.
Salcon said it intends to buy a 51% stake in glove manufacturing company JR Engineering and Medical Technologies (M) Sdn Bhd (JR) for RM28.56 million.
Salcon's subsidiary Nusantara Jasakita Sdn Bhd (NJSB) has entered into a share sale agreement with JR, according to a statement.
The proposed acquisition comes with a profit guarantee of RM10 million a year for the coming three financial years ending Dec 31, 2021 (FY21) until FY23.
""With an annual production of over 336 million gloves from four single former production lines in their factory located in Zurah Industrial, Rasa, Hulu Selangor, JR is currently operating beyond its capacity,"" said Salcon.
Thus, in order to cater to the spike in demand in specific export markets, the group is targeting to ramp up its production capacity by an additional 12 lines to a total of 16 production lines within a year, at an estimated capital expenditure of RM150 million, to be funded via internally generated funds and bank borrowings.
This will bring the total group's annual production capacity to three billion pieces.
At present, JR has already in place the necessary approvals such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) certification and the CE Marking Certification (CE) that will enable it to export to the US, European market, and other countries.
""Upon completion of the transaction, Salcon will have immediate access to a trained labour force, existing customers and an immediate source of revenue whilst cutting down on lengthy product approval and registration processes,"" said Salcon's executive director Datuk Eddy Leong.
JR's managing director Ganesan Subramaniam will continue to helm its operations, together with his management team.
""The acquisition is well aligned with Salcon's strategy of growth and diversification. We are confident the resulting significant synergies, economies of scale and enlarged market presence will strengthen the group's growth profile and bring greater long-term value to our stakeholders,"" he added.
Although there are other manufacturers ramping up production capacity and new entrants venturing into this sector, Leong believes a structural change in usage of gloves will ensure there will be continued and strong demand in the market in the near to mid term.
Prior to the announcement, Salcon's share price had already shot up to 38 sen — the highest level since July 2018 from 18 sen early last month."

Maybank IB Retail Research
Permaju Industries acquired 100m ordinary shares of Meridian Bhd (MEDA MK, Not Rated), representing 16.97% of issued shares in Meridian, for MYR26m cash or MYR0.26/sh. The acquisition will be funded entirely via internally generated funds. Pursuant to the acquisition, Meridian is now an associate company of Permaju.
At MYR0.26/sh, Permaja is effectively valuing Meridian at a P/B of 1.2x. The acquisition would allow Permaju to expand its property ventures into the West Malaysian market. At present, Permaju’s property projects are mainly located in Sabah. The acquisition would allow both parties to leverage on respective resources, as Meridian is also involved in property development and construction.
That say, execution is key to success. Meridian has been in the red since FY14 while Permaja’s earnings track record has also been volatile. Meridian’s earnings were affected by the subdued property market while Permaju, which has been in the red since FY07, was weighed by high operating costs. Its property and automotive industries are exposed to weak consumer sentiment.
Permaju has been trying to diversify its earnings base in its bid to turn around. In Sep 2020, the group entered into a joint venture (JV) with VSolar Group (VSOL MK, Not Rated) to submit a tender to build and operate a Large Scale Solar 4 (LSS4) proposed 50MW plant in Seremban. It is also in talks with Anzo Holdings (ANZO MK, Not Rated) to collaborate in the manufacturing of gloves.
But until any deal materializes, its outlook will remain subdued. Permaju recorded a loss after tax of MYR6.6m in FY6/20, with its automotive, timber, and property development divisions all in the red. This does not help when the government implements partial or full lockdown to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, which in turn, would hurt the demand for automotive as well as properties.
Valuation wise, P/B methodology is preferred here due to Permaju’s weak earnings track record. At current price, the stock is trading at a trailing P/B of 0.9x, above its 3-year historical average P/B of 0.7x. The only silver lining is that, its net gearing stood at 0.01x at end-Jun 2020. Investors with lower risk appetite should stay on the sidelines for now."

Subject: SUPPLY AGREEMENT ENTERED BY THE ANZO TRADING SDN BHD (“ATSB”) WITH JAYA JUTAWAN SDN BHD (“JJSB”)
We refer to your Company’s announcement dated 25 February 2021, in respect of the aforesaid matter. In this connection, kindly furnish Bursa Securities with the following additional information for public release: -
1. The relationship between ATSB and ANZO.
ATSB is a wholly-owned Subsidiary of ANZO.
2. As the principle business activities of ATSB are sawmilling and marketing of sawn timber, to clarify on how ATSB to undertake the supply of the Products and whether it has the expertise and capacity to do so.
As ATSB has earlier engaged in the supply of copper scrap when it entered into the supply agreement with CSTME Resources Sdn Bhd, this is merely an extension of its existing business activities in trading of metal scraps.
3. The source of supply (whether locally or overseas) and name of suppliers for the Products.
Anzo Group will source the supply from local suppliers and there are various suppliers in the market to meet the supply requirements.
4. Whether ATSB/ ANZO Group has entered into any long term agreements for the procurement of the Products in order to honour the Supply Agreement. If yes, please provide the full details of such agreement. Otherwise, please justify how will ATSB/ ANZO Group ensure uninterrupted supply of Products to JJSB and the source of the Products.
Anzo Group have yet to enter into any long term supply agreement. Since the prices for the Products fluctuate according to market rates, the Management feels that it needs the flexibility to source for the cheapest source.
5. To quantify the total investment outlay or financial commitment required to undertake the Supply Agreement together with the source of funds.
We estimated around RM5- RM6 mil range with internally generated fund/capital funding.
6. The basis and justification on how the price of RM5,000 per metric tonne is derived from other than willing buyer-willing seller basis.
RM5,000 per metric tonne was based on the recent average market price in Malaysia which use a discount factor to the metal prices quoted at London Metal Exchange (“LME”).
7. Salient terms of the Supply Agreement, including but not limited to, effective date for the supply term of 60 months (including the commencement and cessation date), payment terms, termination clause and compensation clause in the event of non-fulfilment of the parties’ obligations.
The effective date of the Supply Agreement is 60 months from the date of the said agreement, which is 24 February 2021, unless terminated by reasons of:
a. material breach of either party’s obligations under the agreement and fail to remedy such breach within 60 days after being given notice by the other party;
b. if any party declared bankrupt and/or winding up or being entered into receivership; or
c. failure to perform the party’s obligations due to force majeure events beyond either parties control.
JJSB shall pay Anzo Group within 7 days upon receiving the Products. Anzo Group shall supply the Products as per delivery order from JJSB and shall procure the delivery within two weeks from the delivery orders.
8. Background information on JJSB, including date of incorporation, commencement date of business, principal activities of business, issued share capital, name of directors and substantial shareholders together with their shareholdings.
JJSB was a company incorporated at 24 July 2020 with RM1 million issued share capital. The Company is principally engaged in production of aluminium ingot. The director and substantial shareholder is Kevin Tan Yean Khim with 100% shareholding of the company.
9. The risks in relation to the Supply Agreement including whether any relevant regulatory approval is required for Supply Agreement.
The risk of the Supply Agreement includes changes in the regulatory requirements, non-payment from client, funding for working capital and any interruption on the supply of Products. The Board of Directors of Anzo will continue to exercise due care in considering the risks and will take appropriate measures to mitigate such risks.
In Malaysia, a second hand license is required for trading in metal scrap and approval permit is required for exporting the aluminium used beverage cans.
10. Based on the estimated total contract value of RM450,000,000, please state the expected profit contribution to the Group and the basis in deriving at.
We are unable to disclose the profit contribution due to sensitivity of the information, but the profit margin should be in the single digit range.
11. Further clarification and justification as to how the Supply Agreement will create business opportunities in the export market for ANZO Group.
12. Whether the Supply Agreement signifies the proposed diversification in business operations to ANZO Group pursuant to Paragraph 10.13 of the Main Market Listing Requirements.

FUNDS from get-rich-quick and fake online investment schemes — such as JJ Poor to Rich, AAM Global Corp Sdn Bhd, MBI International Sdn Bhd, Water Beaute World Bhd and Syarikat Island Red Cafe Franchise Sdn Bhd — could have seeped into companies trading on Bursa Malaysia, a source familiar with the matter tells The Edge.
He says the movement of funds resulted in erratic trading of shares of the affected counters. “The stock exchange is one of the ways they use to legitimise their gains,” he said on condition of anonymity.
While the source cites a long list of counters, perhaps one of the most noteworthy is Water Beaute World Bhd, which has been on Bank Negara Malaysia’s “list of known companies and websites which are not authorised nor approved under the relevant laws and regulations administered by BNM” since May 9.
Water Beaute World surfaced as a substantial shareholder in Raya International Bhd (formerly Envair Holding Bhd) on Sept 2, 2015, with 5.61% equity interest or 7.32 million shares, and by the end of the month, it had 8.13% or 10.6 million shares. By the end of May last year, it had accumulated 17.94 million shares, or a 12.51% stake.
On June 10 last year, Water Beaute World sold its entire stake of 12.58% or about 18 million shares. Based on the closing price of 23 sen, Water Beaute World would have received RM4.2 million.
Since then, Raya International’s share price has not moved much.
Back when Water Beaute World was a shareholder, for no apparent reason, the share price surged more than 40% within a week to hit 36 sen on May 30, 2016. It is unlikely that Raya International, which makes air filter and carbon cartridges, could generate such interest on the strength of its earnings potential alone. For the first three months of FY2017, the company posted a net profit of only RM548,000 from RM23.10 million in sales.
While this churning may seem to be nothing out of the ordinary, WBW Global Sdn Bhd and AXD System Global Sdn Bhd — which have the same registered address (in Taman Shamelin Perkasa) and same business address (in Taman Bayu Tinggi, Klang) as Water Beaute World — have surfaced in Anzo Holdings Bhd (formerly Harvest Court Industries Bhd).
Water Beaute World and AXD share a director and shareholder in Lui Leong Eng, who has 25% in Water Beaute World and 89.2% in AXD.
WBW Global surfaced in Anzo at end-November 2016 with 18.86 million shares or 6.30% equity interest, while AXD surfaced on Jan 10 this year with 15.70 million shares or a 5.23% stake. AXD ceased to be a substantial shareholder after selling seven million shares on April 21.
From end-January to mid-April, Anzo’s share price gained more than 130%, from 23 sen to 54 sen. Since mid-April, it has fallen to regular levels and closed last Friday at 23.5 sen. A check on Anzo’s annual report indicates that WBW Global has 6.31% equity interest in the company and Water Beaute World has 3.68%.
But WBW Global is not cited as a substantial shareholder in Anzo. The largest shareholder with 22.38% is Datuk Chai Woon Chet.
Anzo, whose mainstay is timber products, suffered a net loss of RM4.63 million from revenue of RM12.26 million for the financial year ended March 31, 2017.
WBW Global surfaced as a substantial shareholder in Plastrade Technology Bhd on April 19, 2016, with 5.57% equity interest or 8.65 million shares. AXD surfaced on Nov 18 last year with a stake of 7.91% or 11.90 million shares. WBW Global ceased to be a substantial shareholder on the same day after selling 7.97 million shares.
AXD, meanwhile, accumulated 21.79 million shares or a 14.49% stake in Plastrade, but has yet to sell any shares although the share price has gained more than 290% from end-January to mid-May.
Plastrade, which manufactures polyethylene products, suffered a net loss of RM77,000 from revenue of RM12.74 million in the first three months of its 2017 financial year.
Last Friday, Plastrade ended trading at 34.5 sen.
Other erratic share price movements that defy logic include those at Seacera WA. Its share price shot up from four sen to 25 sen on April 14 before tumbling to 6.5 sen the next day. It then rose to 15.5 sen (when?).
Seacera WA was suspended from trading on April 27 and the last day to exercise its warrants was May 16, a day before it was de-listed.
Two other companies — Vizione Holdings Bhd and XOX Bhd — are linked to Anzo’s Chai. Chai is an executive director at Vizione but does not have a substantial shareholding. At XOX, he is managing director and is not a substantial shareholder as well.
Interestingly, XOX’s largest shareholder with 3.08% is WBW Global, while Water Beaute World has 3.01% equity interest

They will keep diluting then consolidation, same process appears afterwards.
Do not buy XOX above 0.07, let all private placement and XOX employees ESOS die.
They keep issuing private placements (more 2.5 billions share unit since FY2020) below market price and then sell to retailer at market price to get 10% immediate encash.
Previously you own 100k units, you are above 100k over total circulated XOX shareholding of 1Billion.
Now if your 100k units became 100k over the 3.9Billion XOX shareholdings.
Retailers have been diluted to death silently.
This HOPELESS management uses the money to goreng their own shareholdings in other listed penny stocks. For the past 4 months, XOX finished all their cash, channel out the XOX cash to themselves. They do it by buying rotten, big loss making and dying stocks that owned by them at low price, use XOX cash to goreng until godlike prices. Then they sold it to XOX.
XOX has ended up at villain in the following stocks
1. Spent RM2.6M to buy M3Tech @ 0.036 average price, now price is 0.05
2. Spent a whoping RM22M to buy MACPIE @ 0.47, now price is 0.18
3. Spent RM39M to buy NEXION technology @ 0.33, now price is 0.33
4. Spent RM30M to buy DGB @ 0.12, now price is 0.08
5. Spent RM44.6M to buy CHeetah@ 1.32, when market price is only 0.40
Total cash spent on buying rubbish stocks RM138.2M BURNT, and channel into their cronies and their own stockholding in other entities.
Take note and keep reminding each other on their tactics

@OngMoneyOng 2执法单位数周前突袭联和大厦
盘查操控60仙股神秘黑手事件
10/04/2021
权威财经周刊THE EDGE报导揭露，执法当局在数个星期前，突袭及盘查雪州丽阳高球俱乐部一带的联和大（MENARA LIEN HOE）数家公司，取走文件，以调查数名特定人士参与操纵大马交易所仙股案件。
THE EDGE报导说，执法当局是接获投报，指国内一个由数个神秘人物控制的集团，控制高达60家上市公司，并通过种种手段，操纵股价，更以各种财技手法，从上市公司吸资金或资产。
报导说，调查焦点集中於一名四十岁左右神秘企业家，该名人士通过代理控制大量上市公司，但是却没有一间上市公司和他有直接关系。
THE EDGE制作一个图表，列出和这名神秘企业家有关的数十家上市公司，大多数由SANSTON FINANCIAL GROUP控制，这家公司是由香港SANSTON持有，根据这家公司官网显示，它是持有香港牌照的证券行。
THE EDGE在报导中引述一些部落格撰文指出，该名男子控仙股的规模和手法，堪称是另一个＂苏启文＂，市场上有关该名人士操控多家上市公司的传言，流传多个月。
根据了解，有两个执法单位，即反贪污委员会和内陆税收局参与有关执法行动，突袭联和大厦，但是证券监督委员会并没有在行动中。
THE EDGE也引述消息说，国家银行正在紧密观察该集团的动向。
该集团控制的40家上市公司中，有11家办事处设在联和大厦，包括宜鼎（AT），MLABS，富科斯（FOCUS），万科科技（MTOUCHE），FINTEC环球（FINTEC），XOX说（XOX），M3科技（M3TECH），NETX HOLDING，LAMBO GROUP，KGROUP，VSOLAR集团等。

And this 64 mil consists of some revenue from the construction segments. With back of the envelope calculation, Anzo should have delivered RM422 million revenue just from the copper deal alone up until 30th June 2021. Instead, it only delivered 64 mil revenue which is just 15% on target. 85% off target and there is no clarification from Anzo on this. How would Anzo catch up back on the 85% off target? Most probably Anzo wont be delivering in the remaining 24 months. The latest quarter results would confirm whether Anzo can fulfill such 1.3 billions contract value or just a hoax like their Manjung gloves news."

Just look at AA, MAHB, GenM, etc. They all are losing money and will cont to lose money in the next few quarters before they pick up back on the sales and make profits which would require at least 5 - 8 years to cover back all the losses. Yet, ppl dont care and chase them. These counters wont be giving any dividends for years to come as they need to rebuild their cash and reduce the debts.
Same for gloves, all making high profits but get sold off since Nov 2020 while they still delivered highest profit in June 2021. Ppl just sell and dont care as they dont think they can deliver higher profit anymore. A company that was only delivering 30-40 mil profit per quarter and may deliver 100 mil profit per quarter in 2022/2023 post covid, yet ppl stll sell below pre-covid 19 price. Fundamental only will come when all the excitement died down.
As for Anzo, it s purely for goreng. A company that isnt making profit or having a sustainable biz model for the last 10 years, wont suddenly change its leopard spot and become profitable with sustainable biz. Question is how much the boss wanna goreng this time and how he gonna goreng it to keep Anzo from being delisted."
