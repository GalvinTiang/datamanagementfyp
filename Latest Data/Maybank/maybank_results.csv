Surely EPF has been doing a great job all this while, i mean since years ago. This scheme really worked very well. Workers have their cash placed into EPF monthly, whereby EPF will have to earn the handsome profits from the investment using the workers' money. EPF just dare not declare any annual dividend which is lower than interest earned from a bank (e.g FD rate) because it appeared that EPF must have earned much higher profit so to enable it to pay a reasonably high dividend rate to the workers."

KUALA LUMPUR: Malayan Banking Bhd posted record net profit of RM8.11bil in the financial year ended Dec 31, 2018 boosted mainly by higher loans growth, lower overhead costs as well as lower provisioning.
Maybank, Southeast Asia’s fourth largest bank by assets, announced on Tuesday net profit rose by 7.9% from the RM7.52bil in FY17. Pre-tax profit increased by 8% to RM10.91bil from RM10.10bil a year ago.
Its revenue increased by 3.8% to RM47.32bil from RM45.58bil. It announced a dividend of 32 sen for the final quarter.
In the fourth quarter, its net profit rose by 9.1% to RM2.33bil from RM2.13bil while revenue increased by 3.8% to RM12.33bil from RM11.78bil.
Maybank chairman, Datuk Mohaiyani Shamsudin said the results reflected the underlying strength and resilience of the group, which had to contend with an extremely challenging year in 2018.
“Our strategy of growing responsibly, while managing expenses and pricing in a disciplined manner, were key factors that enabled us to remain on a steady growth trajectory despite the heightened volatility in global markets,” she said.
Mohaiyani also said the proposed final single-tier dividend of 32 sen per share would be made under its dividend reinvestment plan. It comprises a 15 sen cash portion and a 17 sen electable portion which can be reinvested into new ordinary shares or paid in cash.
“Together with the 25 sen interim dividend declared earlier, the full year dividend payout of 57 sen per share amounts to RM6.3bil or 77.3% of net profit.
“The total dividend payout also translates into a higher dividend yield of 6.0% (vs 5.6% in 2017), again placing Maybank as one of the banks offering the highest dividend yields in the region,” she said.
Group president and CEO Datuk Abdul Farid Alias said the group continued to benefit from its strong franchise in the region as well as its strong fundamentals, which gave it the capacity to navigate through the challenging year.
“We remain cautious over the global operating environment given continued geopolitical concerns as well as volatility in commodity prices, although we expect greater stability in the domestic market arising from measures being put in place to ensure sustainable growth,” he said.
“We believe we can leverage business opportunities in ASEAN where the economies will show respectable growth, while at the same time, benefit from our focus on digitalisation which will help us achieve better efficiencies and new frontiers in customer experience.”

In the near future, Nearly all Malaysian need a maybank account to do transaction. Something like, when Malaysian fly, they cannot foreever avoid Airasia.

Perhaps the approach seemed logical in 1945; however, the U.S. and UK orchestrated 1953 coup d’état against Mohammad Mosaddegh, Iran’s prime minister, who nationalized Iran’s oil, and the Iranian revolution of 1979 which led to overthrow of the Shah, the American courts blocked Iran’s assets in the U.S. The movements showed that the IMF is an arm of the U.S. Department of State and the Pentagon. In today’s global politics, international finance and foreign investment have become leverage against nations who won’t bow down to U..S policies.
Lately, foreign countries are apprehensive about their gold holdings in the U.S. They know full well that their assets can be blocked unilaterally by the U.S. if Washington’s interests are threatened. That is why in 2017, Germany decided to repatriate half of its gold reserves from the U.S. The U.S. authorities have considered the act an insult to their own civilized state.
Now, it’s Venezuela’s turn. The country called on the Bank of England to return $1.2 billion of its reserved gold to repair the economy, which has been hurting by the American sanctions.
The Bank of England, however, froze Venezuelan gold asset following Mike Pompeo United States Secretary of State and Bolton’s instruction. Bloomberg wrote that the U.S. handed control of Venezuela’s bank accounts in the U.S. to the opposition leader Juan Guaido to have a better chance to control the self-claimed government."

Guan Eng clarifies bank windfall tax remark
TheEdgeThu, Mar 21, 2019 - 32 minutes ago
KUALA LUMPUR (March 21): Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng clarified today that the government has no intention to impose windfall taxes on banks in Malaysia, hence, these financial institutions can be more flexible in their lending arrangements.
Lim, who was speaking at a press conference in Parliament today, was clarifying his remarks on Tuesday (March 19) at the Invest Malaysia Kuala Lumpur 2019 event where reporters quoted him as telling banks to ""be flexible, unless you prefer windfall tax"".
On Tuesday, Lim was quoted as saying in his keynote address: ""We want to ask the banks to be more flexible in their lending arrangement, because we got many complaints (about it). So, I think it's time for you to start lending or unless you prefer windfall taxes.""
Today, Lim told the media to look at the context when he was making the remark.
""If you look at the context of what I said, there is no intention, just that since we don't impose windfall taxes, we hope they can be more flexible in their lending arrangements since they are making so much money, share a bit,"" he said.

De-dollarization has already been in action for quite some time now as the global geopolitical space is divided into two camps, one who supports US currency as a global reserve tool and other ones are those that have turned their backs on the greenback.
Countries like China, Russia, Iran, India, and Turkey among others have taken steps towards ending the US dollar monopoly.
Now the dollar’s share in global central bank reserve is also taking a hit as it slumped to the lowest level since 2013 while Chinese yuan share has risen significantly.
According to the IMF’s Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER) for Q4 2018 report, the US currency’s share went down from 61.9% to 61.7% in the fourth quarter, marking the tenth decline in the past 12 quarters.

Foreign capital flows to China are expected to rise from Monday after a portion of the nation's nearly-$13 trillion of onshore bonds were included in a key global index.
On Monday, China's renminbi-denominated government and policy bank securities were included in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index, a global fixed-income investment benchmark, which could trigger more capital inflows into the country and provide stability to currency and fund borrowers.
Global banks have predicted that the Bloomberg Barclays index inclusion will attract $700 billion to $800 billion of overseas funds for the next five years. More than 67 percent of the market participants in Asia are likely to increase their investment in Chinese onshore bonds this year, driven largely by the index inclusion, said a recent survey from Bloomberg, the US-based financial information provider.
The State Administration of Foreign Exchange said on Friday that improving convertibility of the capital account would be one of the key tasks this year so as to gradually achieve free cross-border capital flows and further open the bond market."

In a note today, the research house said it views this as a positive development for the Maybank group, but cognisant that the deadline for Hyflux’s debt moratorium (granted by the Singapore High Court) period is nearing, by 30 April 2019.
“Failing which, there could be some negative repercussions on Maybank’s 2019E earnings, i.e. higher credit cost vs. its guidance of 40 basis point (bps) for 2019 (Affin’s 2019E: 47bps), should all parties failed to strike a deal."

Actually this is quite mis;leading if you are not long the counter. If you trace back to 31st March 2009, which is exactly 10 years now. average price for Maybank has growth from RM2.155 (adjusted price due to bonuses and etc..) in March 2009 to now RM9.02. This is 418% compare to 10 years ago. If your luck is bad enough and bought high price. The highest before the dip in 2008 also at RM5.5832 in 2007 February. which also have 5.1% growth beside the good dividend received yearly."

Holders of Hyflux preference shares and perpetual securities are claiming some S$970 million from the company, with medium-term noteholders asking for another S$277.7 million.
Mr Seah asked whether the government could ride to the rescue of these retail investors.
“Investors in search of returns must understand that returns come with some risks,” Mr Masagos told the House in reply.
“We can understand the concerns and anxiety of the retail investors and we are saddened by their plight, but the government cannot use taxpayers’ money to help investors recoup their investment losses, even if there are any proceeds from the takeover of the Tuas plant.
“You must remember there is an order to who gets what first. In this case, Maybank will still receive payments from TPL before all other general creditors, including PUB.”
Hyflux still owes Maybank some S$518 million, which is secured by the Tuaspring plant."

that's is your brother problem, he need to find out why after 20 years the EPF still make more money than his stock investment
he should have stop invest in stock in the 5 years , not until 20 years its too late when come to
invest in stock among the main thing is you buy in at WHAT PRICE and what is the company GROWTH STORY /COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
If we cannot answer these 2 questions confidently , then better don't buy and invest
how to make profit in share invest and also in biz is we make a investment when nobody see the value or it is under value
example MAYBANK as Msia largest bank by assets and invest in it at low price and keep it until value emerge
example do biz offer products/services that other dont have , you will make big profit"

understand the biz, why it success or fail
also don't invest all your money , especially emergency one , need keep some
yes, market will recover eventually , but if we don't have holding power , how to wait until market recover ? so need have holding power
I am sleep well in night , invest in MAYBANK , even it huge drop
because funds will support it, if MAYBANK share price huge drop until RM4 or below, our Msia economy is doom...….."

Total Market capitalisation of Maybank now slightly less than RM1000Bn, NTA RM6.812. PE 12. Impairment of 1.63Bn will reduce the 2019 target profit to RM8.67Bn. Assuming profit at 8.67Bn, earning per share will be RM0.79278. at current price of RM8.98. PE is only 11.32.

Hyflux like so many company suffered due to over expansion at the wrong time
At its peak in year 2013 Hyflux was invited to the Middle East to do Water Plants
Huge amounts of monies were invested with the hope of profit. But alas! Next year in 2014 Crude Oil price collapsed....many could not pay Hyflux...So Hyflux concentrated on its homeground in Singapore
Now Hyflux went into an uncharted business of Tuaspring in desalination plant with excess electricity to be sold to the Spore Power Grid
Again due to the Collapse of Oil & Gas there was surplus electricity generated from Jurong Island several Oil Refineries
This caused price war to the happiness of Spore consumer
Many households can opt for different power suppliers. Of course we opt for the cheapest
Now Hyflux suffering deep losses will go bankrupt soon
Many thought Hyflux is like GLC in Malaysia which must be saved, Just like Malaysian Govt saved FGV by injecting more than Rm6 billions to save it
But Spore practises meritocrasy and took Tuaspring of Hyflux as a commercial venture
So like any business entity Hyflux will succeed or fail on its own merit.
INVESTMENT FUNDS SAW MALAYSIA DEFICIT WORSENING DUE TO BAILING OUT GLCs WHILE THEY ALSO SEE SPORE GOVT PROTECTING ITS RESERVES CAREFULLY
SO THEY SOLD DOWN RINGGIT RECENTLY WHILE SPORE CURRENCY REMAIN FIRM
Now what will happen to Maybank being the one that gave out the most loan to Hyflux?
Maybank might lose more than Rm1.5 Billions or more
That will shave of at least 18 sen from Maybank share price
So Maybank is worth about Rm7.00 a share
You guys better sell off Maybank before others know and start selling

Calvin from Singapore

Think about it, in the long term, has the business fundamentals of Maybank changed? Are it's branches closing down? Is it no longer profitable? Are you going to close your mbb account and open savings in POSB?
It's impossible. The exposure, the balance sheet basically everything is solid, even if you have another salad oil crisis ( like AMEX) it will only mean that you get to buy more Maybank at Rock bottom prices.
The business fundamentals are untouched in the long term.

The PrimeWin RM1,000,000 CASA-i will run from now until April 30, 2020, and is open to the bank's savings and current account holders.
The campaign carries a grand prize of RM1 million and total cash prizes worth close to RM2 million.
Depositors have an opportunity to win the cash prize through the financial institution's monthly and quarterly draws throughout the campaign period.
""With this campaign, we will be able to reward our current customers as well as draw new customers to experience banking with MBSB Bank,"" said its group president and chief executive Datuk Seri Ahmad Zaini Othman.
Ahmad Zaini said the bank will be implementing further digitalisation of its operations, which includes introducing mobile application and digital branches to its customers.
It will also introduce its first debit card, the MBSB Bank Visa Debit Card-i.
On the relocation of its headquarters to PJ Sentral, Ahmad Zaini said: ""The new building has our employees' best interests in mind. Not only is it a green building, it will have an activity-based workplace concept, a working environment that allows for collaborative workspace, (and) creative engagement resulting in a happy and productive workforce.""
""It will also be equipped with a creche, a facility that is not embraced widely by most companies in Malaysia,"" he added.
At 3.55pm, MBSB's shares rose 0.5 sen or 0.51% to 98.5 sen, valuing the group at RM6.26 billion. Some 1.42 million shares changed hands."

美国10日正式对价值2000亿美元的中国货品提高关税，税率从10%增为25%，中国随即扬言采取反制措施，但美中贸易谈判仍持续进行，全球投资人屏息以待华府与北京贸易的谈判结果。
美银美林策略师预测，美中贸易谈判可能出现三种结局，分别会把美股标普500指数带往不同的境地。第一种是敲定贸易协议，如果这样，标普500指数将大涨，奔向3,000点大关，受惠最大的可望是运输股、半导体股以及德国DAX股价指数、韩国KOSPI指数以及全球银行股。
第二种是暂缓达成协议，标普500指数将从目前约2,870点跌到2,775点，然后强弹。第三种则是两方协议谈不拢，由于贸易战势必导致经济和市场陷入混乱，美国联准会恐怕不得不降利率，届时标普500指数可能跌破2600点，投资资金逃离风险性资产，例如科技股、新兴市场债券、投资级公司债等。
华尔街分析师上周纷纷对贸易战与美股展望发表看法，Lombard Odier投资管理公司的策略师团队认为，美中贸易谈判情况会先恶化，然后好转，投资人要有市场震荡期拉长的心理准备，“中国和新兴市场股市回档整理幅度可能超过15%，全球股市下跌5%至7%。”
法国兴业银行分析师表示：“无论如何，未来数周，紧张气氛仍挥之不去。”
美银美林中国与亚洲经济学家乔虹指出，最可能发生的情况是贸易僵局，今年美中两国经济成长改善，降低双方签署协议的迫切性，双方可能透过媒体严辞交锋，未来数季才重返谈判桌，市场将持续动荡，直到情势明朗化。"

Let's say you can tell the future and you know it will be 7.50 in three years and then go back to around 9.30 like it's always done. So you wait three years and then you buy at 7.50 and sure enough it goes up to 9.30. You laugh at the poor fool who was buying all the way down to Rm7.50, and thank the Gods for your ability to see the future. Didn't he lose so much money in three years?
If you really sit down and think about it, who made more money, the one who couldn't tell the future and so bought all the way down, or the guy with the gift of future sight who bought at the bottom? :)
Think about it, really think about it. Who made more money?"

All Maybank staff received extra 10% increment in your monthly salary starting 2019. This is not one off 10%, it is continuous extra payment to you every month. This is far better than Malaysia government servants whereby they do not have any increment at all in 2019. The higher salary doesn’t tally with the lousy report card you gave us!
This is reflected by dropping Maybank share price due to loss of confidence in investors of your performance! The 10% increment in your salary is seriously NON HALAL with these poor performance!
For the biggest bank in Malaysia, your share price can’t even compete with public bank. Despite huge competition among all telecommunications companies, Telekom (TM) outshine, stood high above all, leading Malaysia to 5G network to achieve vision 2020/2030! TM has done better job that you, Maybank!

Trump ‘may start global currency war’ next
WASHINGTON (AFP) – President Donald Trump’s renewed focus on what he calls “unfair” exchange rates could presage a new global battlefield that has the potential to do great damage to the world economy.
If Trump follows this new path, likely with the backing of Commerce Secretary and trade hardliner Wilbur Ross, the United States would be vulnerable to retaliation when the Federal Reserve eventually cuts the benchmark interest rate as Trump has demanded they do.
Central banks use interest rate cuts to spur a sluggish economy, weakening a currency’s value in exchange for boosting exports, which then power economic growth."

THIS SHOWS THAT THE BORROWERS CAN PAY IF HE BORROWS. THE LOAN PAYMENT AMOUNT IS ABOUT 1/3 OF HIS INCOME OR SALARY

B) GOLD OR GOLD CERTIFICATE DEPOSITED WITH THE BANK
C) ASSETS LIKE LANDS, HOUSES, SHOPS OR FACTORIES PLEDGED AS SECURITY FOR BORROWING OR OD (OVERDRAFT).

History tells that HK was forcibly taken from the Chinese Qing Dynasty after the end of the Opium Wars; problem was while HK was given to the British in perpetuity, the British only arranged for a 99 year lease on the New Territories (which then constituted about 90% of the total area of the enlarged HK). The Brits at that time, in their arrogance and hubris, thought that their empire will last forever and can easily renew the lease when it expired. Of course, reality turned out differently. The brits could have just returned the NT and kept HK and Kowloon but the area would have been too small and unsustainable so they returned everything. If the Brits have cared about its subjects in HK, it would hv at least granted them permanent residence rights in Britain but of course the Brits just screwed the HK subjects and left them to deal with the situation on their own. One must know that HK, Kowloon and NT have always been part of China, and there is no way that China will allow for an independent HK. If the protests persist and turn violent, it will not end well."

No problem for them if they want to do this because they have large shareholdings and considerable finances, and they can always get more shares by opting to reinvest their dividends into extra shares. Maybank should stop their dividends reinvestment schemes already to stop diluting their share cap further and making their eps weak in the process."

But crumpled by late afternoon when we run out of such impatient novices. To make good money in stocks like maybank, you need to be very, very patient. Buy some when price falls in late afternoon. Then sell to the impatient novices in early morning the next day. It is a game worth considering. However if you don't wish to swing trade, then wait till the long term trend changes. Currently the trend is down, down, down. If you consider Maybank's dividend yield, the price should not go down. However, a stock's price is more sentiment driven than value driven as most people are emotionally driven. When a stock's price goes downwards, folks try to sell before others sell. And if price drops like a waterfall, folks get panic stricken and there is a rush for the exit ie exiting the stock. The emotion of fear is worse than the emotion of greed. Let us not be impatient and rush to buy just because the price had looked attractive today. Who knows, the price may get even more attractive the next few days. There is no rush to buy but just hang on to your money and buy later when buyers had disappeared. It is a risk of missing the boat, but maybe not that bad as you won't lose in a price recovery. The great investor George Soros advised that if you are sure the price is clearly moving up, then buy and pyramid up. No doubt if you are a bit late in buying near the low, at least you are on the winning bet when price is clearly moving upwards. Currently there are too many negative news on stocks like maybank, and my guess is unless positive news emerge, it may be prudent to wait it out for a good low to buy. It is just my opinion, take it or leave it."

On the other hand, China needs Malaysia to secure it's straits of melaka oil passage. So Malaysia will do well from China injection. The problem is that China's fund probably not so active in equity, but more on infrastructure?

In a rare move, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Beijing, which has Cabinet-level authority over the former British colony, is due to hold a press conference at 3pm about the unrest gripping the former British colony.
That follows another weekend of clashes between protesters and police, who again fired rubber bullets and tear gas as the demonstrations grow increasingly violent."

1. Maybank's total dividend paid is around 5.1b from 2011 to 2016. Almost flat for that 5 years. Do you know what happen during that period?
2. Is DRP the reason why Maybank shares lagged behind PB Bank? Do you think PBB is over-rated?
Though PBB has lower NPL, but it's growth is slowing down. And there's a risk that the license won't get renewed (because he's a chinese)"

As for Q3, PBB's book to price value is more than double, people are paying more as some claim its growth is faster than other banks.
PBB license will not be withdrawn, but the fear is the boss's shareholding will be diluted after his death. Tan Sri Teh holds 24$ of PBB under the grandfather's rule. Once he is gone, no one single person can hold more than 5%, therefore his shares will be floated, which may affect the price."

In calling for freedom of speech, citizens who disagreed with the protesters have found themselves beaten up, which seems to go against the grain.

The news comes after the ministry said on Tuesday Chinese companies had stopped buying U.S. agriculture products in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's decision last week to impose tariffs on another $300 billion of Chinese imports, sharply escalating a tit-for-tat trade dispute between the world's largest economies.
The commodities were removed from a draft tariff quota management list posted on the official website of the Ministry of Commerce, which means they will not be subject to restrictions which may be exacted on other products such as wheat, corn and rice."

The announcements came as tens of thousands of high school and university students boycotted class on Monday and riot police patrolled subway stations following a weekend of some of the most intense clashes yet between protesters and security forces in Hong Kong’s nearly three-month-old political crisis.
The government could invoke the territory’s Emergency Regulations Ordinance, a colonial-era law that gives the government sweeping powers and would allow easier arrests, detentions, deportations and internet censorship."

HOW DOES IT WORK?
Under a negative rate policy, financial institutions are required to pay interest for parking excess reserves with the central bank. That is, any surplus cash beyond that which regulators say banks must keep on hand. That way, central banks penalize financial institutions for holding on to cash in the hope of prompting them to boost lending to businesses and consumers.
The ECB introduced negative rates in June 2014, lowering its deposit rate to -0.1% to stimulate the economy. Describing the euro zone economy as mired in a period of ""protracted"" weakness, ECB chief Mario Draghi announced on Thursday a 10-basis-point cut in the deposit rate to -0.5% from its previous -0.4%.
The Bank of Japan (BOJ) adopted negative rates in January 2016, mostly to prevent an unwelcome strenghtening of the yen from hurting an export-reliant economy. It charges 0.1% interest on a portion of excess reserves financial institutions park with the BOJ."

this quote is very useful in investing
its simply means that monitor all the stocks that have problem/risk/uncertainty and do deeper homework as this risky stock if goes wrong will wipe out our capital for invest
example is : oil stock such as SAPURA., HIBISCUIS, PETRONM, HENGYUAN, these u need to always worry and monitor the new to see oil price up or down & oil price have too many issue that will affect it price and most of the time it is out of control one
also the chart u can see is roller coaster , up down up down
Banking sector such as MAYBANK need to monitor the BNM OPR policy la, global news la, domestic economy la, government policy la all this will effect bank profit and share price
also banking share price is at lowest for some bank, how more low it can go or it will rebound and reverse trend? this all need monitor closely
I can say based on current domestic and global economy conditions, almost 90% of KLSE stocks fall under 'focus on downside' category lo
where else, upside that is stock on uptrend or have good cataylst , it will auto move into good direction, share price getting higher and higher , so spend lesser time to focus on these stock as it is less risky and less risk to loss money or loss capital
good example is REITs, it rental income is stable and dividend also stable so less time & effort need to be spend on them
besides, PANAMY also is good example, reliable management, good financial status, good dividend, just few months need go and see once can already, no need to monitor deeply
NESTLE is another good example, uptrend all the way"

As a reminder, according to Morningstar research director, Sandy Fielden, “Brent could go to $80 tomorrow, while WTI could go to $75... But that would depend on Aramco’s 48-hour update. The supply problem won’t be clear right away since the Saudis can still deliver from inventory.""
Of course, should Aramco confirm that the outage will last for weeks, expect the Brent onslaught to continue until the price hits $80, and keeps moving higher."

Haha, another beautiful strategy but the ultimate outcome is ... those with power and $ and corrupted will share more as they are the decision makers, either in private sector or public sector; they themselves decide their lucrative remuneration but at the same time talk about social responsibility and minimize income discrepancies; demand for productivity but they themselves don't have objective KPIs, can withdraw high remuneration if the company failed to deliver profit.....
As for banking sector poor people will continue to be squeezed as better rate normally is offered to high net worth. As for motor insurance, after detariff, all kinds of funny plan which squeeze consumers are in the market.

If you don't consider dividend ex-dates and consider just price action, evidently price have been on a downtrend of 13 months since Sept 2018. Don't you think for example that in Sept 2018 that you somehow sense with the theme of trade wars and consequential slowdown in world economy that maybank may fall in tandem with the deteriorating sentiments that you should sell all your maybank shares and hopefully to buy back at a later date? Simply put sell in region of 10 bucks and now buy back at 8.50 bucks. How glorious it would be? Imagine you are those funds like epf etc thinking this way, don't you agree they are not behaving weirdly? Of course there is the fear of missing the boat if you sell too early. You just have to make your own judgement.

A case for eg, recently charge repayment of loans using cash deposit machine, that is extremely ridiculous, luckily consumer association is not sleeping and they have to stopped immediately. But expect more to come. We don't expect everyone can afford to have a smart phone or computer at home together with data plan."

Students are seeking to have police banned from entering campuses
Hong Kong is facing another day of anti-government protests after a night of pitched battle at a top university.
At the Chinese University of Hong Kong police fired tear gas and rubber bullets as protesters ignited fires and petrol bombs until the early hours.
Considerable student anger over police moving their operation onto campuses was matched by police warning that the rule of law was close to ""collapse"".
Riot police continue to be deployed across the city.
The police decision to enter campuses signals a shift in strategy, correspondents say, as they have largely avoided clearance operations at schools and universities."

Banks advise customers to use mobile banking amid suspension of the services of a set of branches due to protests.
Continuing protests in Hong Kong keep disrupting the operations of local banks. Today, a number of bank branches are closed due to what is (in a politically correct manner) referred to as “public events”.
HSBC published a notice on its website warning that several of its branches are closed today:
“HSBC University of Hong Kong Branch, Festival Walk Branch & Premier Centre, Jade Plaza Branch, Central Branch & Premier Centre, Exchange Square Branch & Premier Centre are closed on 12 November 2019 due to public events. HSBC customers can use the Bank’s Internet Banking, Mobile Banking, Phone Banking or self-service banking terminals. We are sorry for the inconvenience and will provide updates on the operation of our outlets as the situation evolves”.
Standard Chartered has informed its customers of nine branches affected by the “public events”."

What's the purpose of this? Is it to pull down the market? Who is the person behind all these? is it some political tactics behind but no one really know but this incident causes alot businesses to go down and people to lost jobs.
When it link down without living expenses to pay loans and etc, what will Happened to the banking industries if this issue still drags on?

DECEMBER 4, 2019 @ 12:06AM
The market may dictate, but the nation must decide. With or without a ringgit peg. If we have to do it, we should go ahead. - FILE PIC
THE market is saying something about the ringgit. Whether it is right or wrong is up for discussion (expect some economists to disagree with this). When this Leader went to press, the ringgit was trading at 4.17 to the United States dollar.
Is this a fair value of the country’s currency? Free marketeers will be offended by this question. To them, no one will know this except the market. True, there is a market out there — nebulous though it is — but it isn’t as free as we like to think it is."

We should not be too quick to assign inevitability to the decisions of the market. Plus, Cambridge University economist Ha-Joon Chang tells us what makes the market “free” is, if at all it is so, a political decision. He is right.
The government is always involved in the market. Here and everywhere else. So are free marketeers! Adam Smith is wrong: the invisible hand isn’t invisible at all. But this is a discussion for another time."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000318.jsp?ftp=208","Dec 4, 2019 12:50 PM","masterus","What causes the ringgit to be where it is? There are many factors, but first let’s settle the fair value question. Notwithstanding views to the contrary, we think there is one. So does the chief economist at Bank Islam, Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid, who has been keeping tabs on the ringgit. He says the ringgit has averaged 3.59 to the US dollar since July 2015 when Malaysia unpegged the currency.
To Afzanizam, the ringgit’s fair value should range between 3.80 and 3.90 to the US dollar. Close to the homegrown solution of pegging the ringgit at 3.80 to the US dollar."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000318.jsp?ftp=208","Dec 4, 2019 12:51 PM","masterus","So what determines the value of the ringgit? Simply put, whatever happens within and without. Crude oil prices and the US-China trade war are two external determinants. Consider the trade war. According to Afzanizam, there has been a rise in risk aversion among investors since the trade spat began between the world’s two largest economies.
The effect: rush to buy “safe haven” currencies, such as the US dollar, Swiss franc, Japanese yen and euro. The result: a weakening of the ringgit. Unfortunately, this is one lever Malaysia can’t pull or push. It must look at what is within its control. Like cost of living issues."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000318.jsp?ftp=208","Dec 4, 2019 12:51 PM","masterus","Take the case of agriculture products. From the farm gate to fork, there are far too many players, especially the middlemen, who make agricultural product prices prohibitive. Business malpractices, such as hoarding, price manipulation and cartels, make the bad situation worse.
Carmelo De Ferlito of the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs says Malaysia can do a number of things that may cause the appreciation of the ringgit. Admitting the possibility of pure speculation in the ringgit, he says currency transactions are largely influenced by the “mood” created by economic fundamentals and other factors.
The market may dictate, but the nation must decide. With or without a ringgit peg. If we have to do it, we should go ahead.

However, these positives were offset by higher loan loss allowances. Besides, lending growth tapered and asset quality weakened a little.
Overall, our forecasts were left unchanged. We still believe that the stock’s risk-reward profile is skewed to the upside, premised on being: (i) a prime candidate for rotational yield play and (ii) less susceptible to foreign equity sell-off.
Hence, retain BUY and GGM-TP of RM9.50, based on 1.30x 2020 P/B.

KBank warns of baht volatility after sell-offs
National
Dec 09. 2019
Facebook TwitterBy The Nation3,458 Viewed
The baht faced sell-offs early in the week in line with falling safe-haven currencies and assets, triggered by stronger-than-expected Chinese PMI (purchase managers index) data.
The baht fell further later in the week to a one-month low of Bt30.38 to the US dollar, after the Bank of Thailand (BOT) signalled to closely monitor the baht's movement and warned that the Thai currency would likely be volatile and might not have one-sided gains as seen in the past months. In addition, the baht’s losses were also in line with net foreign selling orders of Thai stocks. During the week December 9-13, Kasikorn Research Centre (KBank) expects the baht to move within a range of Bt30.20-30.50 to the dollar."

Coming off a lower base from 2 consecutive years of decline (2018 and 2019), we project 2020 KLCI earnings growth at 6.4%. KLCI’s valuations are compelling vs historical trends (PE at -1SD and earnings yield spread to MGS at +2SD) but fair against peers (PE gap to ASEAN-5 around mean). With foreigners net selling Malaysia in 5 of the past 6 years, we are hopeful that perhaps, the bottom is near.
Our 2020 KLCI target of 1,640 is derived from 16.3x PE (-0.5SD) tagged to 2020 earnings.
Top picks are Maybank, KLCCSS, Dialog, GenM, Sunway, TM, GenP, DRB, LiiHen and MBM.

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000318.jsp?ftp=212","Jan 15, 2020 3:12 PM","masterus","The Australian bushfire season that began in September has been horrific with more than 7 million hectares of bush destroyed, more than 25 deaths, significant loss of livestock, estimates of more than a billion wildlife animals killed and more than 1800 homes destroyed. More than 200 fires are still burning. Following the intensification of the bushfires over the Christmas/New Year period attention has now turned to the impact on the economy. This note looks at the key impacts.
The short-term impact on GDP and wealth"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000318.jsp?ftp=212","Jan 15, 2020 3:13 PM","masterus","Physical disasters invariably cause a brief disruption to economic activity as measured by GDP followed by a boost as wealth destroyed by the disaster is rebuilt. In this sense measured across a year or so they are often seen as positive for economic growth, albeit this seems perverse particularly for those directly impacted."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000318.jsp?ftp=212","Jan 15, 2020 3:13 PM","masterus","The damage to property and wealth flowing from the bushfires will likely run into many billions. For example, the Victorian Black Saturday bushfires are estimated to have cost $4.4bn, whereas the current fires have covered an area 15 times bigger. So there will be a very big rebuilding boost to economic activity to come once the fires are brought under control. But the fires have been very widespread, have been going on for several months now and the crisis is continuing, so there will be a significant short-term negative impact and it likely will involve more than a short-term disruption to economic activity."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000318.jsp?ftp=212","Jan 15, 2020 3:19 PM","masterus","A bigger impact on economic activity is likely to come via a hit to consumer spending as the constant news of the fires and the smoke haze in several capital cities weighs on confidence. Australians were already very hesitant about the economic outlook after the slowdown in growth seen last year and continuing weak wages growth and high underemployment. A Roy Morgan survey released late last year found that 40% of Australians thought that 2020 will be worse than 2019, which is the worse reading since the early 1990s recession. At the same time a record-low 12% thought it would be better resulting in a net negative reading of 28% which is the worst in the survey’s 40-year history."

KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 20): Mobility will be a game-changer in the banking and financial services industry, as products and services can be upgraded on all three of 5G’s new capabilities.
This is according to a report prepared by the National 5G Task Force (5G Task Force) under the stewardship of the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) released on Monday.
""By leveraging 5G's ultra-reliable low-latency communication (uRLLC) and enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) capabilities, financial institutions can deliver a seamless digital banking experience to customers, and enable access to banking activities from anywhere, either via real officers or with robo-advisors (automated, algorithm-driven financial planning),"" it said.
The Task Force added the 5G capabilities will also prove irresistible in mobile trading, as improved access to financial services grants more Malaysians opportunities to grow their business, facilitate trade and increase access to financial services.
Health and life insurers will also be able to make more informed and precise decisions with 5G-enabled data sharing, it said.
""Therefore, the banking and finance sector will benefit from all three of 5G’s capabilities. uRLLC will enable real-time response and control, eMBB will enable lightning-speed data rates, and massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC) will enable robust connections between a large number of devices,"" according to the report."

Stocks Close at Record Highs as Spread of Coronavirus Seen Slowing
https://www.google.com.my/amp/s/www.thestreet.com/.amp/markets/dow-set...
BY JOSEPH WOELFEL , UPDATED: FEB 12, 2020 1:30 PM EST | ORIGINAL: FEB 12, 2020
The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq close at all-time highs as the number of new coronavirus infections slows.
1.
2. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at all-time highs after China said the number of new coronavirus infections slowed to the lowest rate in nearly two weeks.
3. Coronavirus update: 1,118 deaths, 45,206 infected.
4. BP is Real Money's Stock of the Day. The European oil giant has set a ""net zero"" target for emissions by 2050.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at all-time highs Wednesday after China said the number of new coronavirus infections slowed to the lowest rate in nearly two weeks.
The Dow finished up 275.08 points, or 0.94%, to 29,551.42, the S&P 500 rose 0.65% to 3,379.45, and the Nasdaq closed up 0.90% to 9,725.96.
The three exchanges all set intraday highs as well.
The coronavirus outbreak -- the World Health Organization said the official name for the disease caused by the new coronavirus is Covid-19 -- has killed 1,118 people and infected more than 45,200.
But the rate of infections is slowing according to China's National Health Commission, which was hopeful that the spread of the virus around China, the world's second-largest economy, has peaked.
The broader impact of the virus on China's growth, as well as its influence on economies around the world, has yet to be quantified, however.
""We are closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus, which could lead to disruptions in China that spill over to the rest of the global economy,"" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday, adding that there will ""very likely be some effects on the United States."" He told the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday that the Fed should have an idea how much the outbreak has impacted the U.S. economy “fairly soon.”
Sen. Bernie Sanders was declared the winner and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., came in a very close second in a tight race for the Democratic presidential nomination in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday.
Wall Street's reaction to the Sanders win was muted as many investors don't think the senator can win the presidency or believe that if he wins his socialist beliefs and anti-establishment proposals won't pass muster with Congress.
Health care stocks such as UnitedHealth (UNH) - Get Report, which was leading the Dow, rose since Sanders isn't predicted to defeat Donald Trump and therefore his Medicare for All proposal won't get off the ground.
CVS Health (CVS) - Get Report posted stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings but forecast fiscal-year profit that was modestly shy of Wall Street forecasts."

https://www.sinchew.com.my/content/content_2217059.html?%E6%95%A6%E9%A...
（浮罗交怡14日讯）首相敦马哈迪重申，他一定会兑现承诺，在11月举行2020年亚太经济合作论坛（APEC）峰会后，辞去首相职。
他也证实，他与公正党主席拿督斯里安华会面，安华所发表的文告内容都是正确的。
他强调，他不涉及任何其他的动作，且必定会遵守诺言。
马哈迪今日为一项度假村发展计划主持动土礼后，召开新闻发布会。
对于一直重提的辞职课题，马哈迪说，这是因为媒体喜欢一直炒作，他更调侃，对于媒体，若他与安华互相殴打，（因有新闻）会更开心。
好奇138签名人数传言
另外，针对传言指有138名国会议员签署法定声明（SD），支持他任满一届的事件，马哈迪也好奇为何有这样的支持人数。
他说 ，希盟拥有最多国会议员，如果有138名国会议员签署，等于有希盟的国会议员也支持（签署声明）。
他也说，他确实听到很多传言，也有人叫他再当20年的首相。
他自我调侃：“我已94岁，过不久将迈入95岁，不可能做那么久。”
安华昨午就伊党、巫统与公正党一小撮人正在争取签名，以支持马哈迪任相直到任期结束的最新演变，到布城与首相敦马会面，针对移交政权一事进行商讨。
他在会谈结束后发表声明透露，希盟主席理事会将在2月21日召开的会议上，针对首相权力转移一事进行讨论并拍板定案。
安华补充，自己倾向于马哈迪领导国家直到亚太经合论坛峰会结束。

2020-02-14 17:20:32
https://www.sinchew.com.my/content/content_2217173.html
（布城14日讯）财政部长林冠英披露，首相敦马哈迪将于2月27日（星期四）下午4时30分宣布振兴经济配套，以寻求减轻新冠肺炎疫情对马来西亚经济的影响，并保护国人应享有之福利。
挹注额外资源
他发表文告说，振兴经济配套既不是新的预算案，也不是2020年国家预算案的一部分。它将向受影响的领域挹注额外的资源，以使经济尽可能完善发展，并受益于疫情解除之后预期的经济反弹。
“当市场面临严峻挑战之际，我们不应绝望以对，反之，应坚持不懈地让我们的行业得以生存，一旦疫情威胁解除后，我国就可以从经济反弹中受益。现金流是主要问题，受影响的公司必须确保它们在经济反弹时保持生存能力、运营能力并能够从中获利。”
林冠英说，政府将采取措施协助相关公司，同时也会着重于探索其他收入，例如转向鼓励国内旅游和从其他市场采购货物。这还包括保持国内劳动力市场的弹性，同时在短期需求疲软的情况下，确保我们的软硬件基础设施保持不变。
政府各机构密切磋商
“财政部正联合经济事务部、交通部、旅游、艺术和文化部与各别机构制定振兴经济计划。政府已经接洽旅游、物流、及金融领域的主要参与者以进行磋商。政府部门也与中小型企业以及与政府关联的基金和企业举行了会议。”
他说，卫生部在遏止新冠肺炎疫情方面做出了杰出贡献，尽管假新闻呈猖狂繁衍之势，但并未引起公众恐慌。我国的专业卫生人员应获得他们所需的一切支持，以克服此次挑战。
“现在是每个马来西亚人抛开分歧，团结一致的时候。当政府帮助受影响的行业时，我们希望各行业的业内人士也发挥各自作用，协助其客户和供应商，以便所有人都可以应对此次挑战，并待疫情结束后受惠于市场的反弹。正如约翰肯尼迪（John F. Kennedy）所说：‘不要问国家能为你做什么，问你自己能为国家做什么'。”

The impact of the epidemic on the Hong Kong economy is being felt beyond retail, food and beverage and tourism-related industries, Chan said in a blog post Sunday.
The short-term economic outlook is ""cautious,” and shocks can cause the unemployment rate to ""deteriorate rapidly,” Chan said."

By ALIFAH ZAINUDDIN / Pic By MUHD AMIN NAHARUL
THE Malaysian Institute of Economic Research (MIER) expects unemployment to rise in tourism related sectors in the first quarter this year as the Covid-19 outbreak continues to disrupt travel plans and supply chains globally.
Based on projections by the local think tank, unemployment in industries such as recreational services and air travel could spike between 0.5% and 0.8%, and 1.8% and 3.5% respectively, with the latter representing the worst-case scenario.
MIER deputy director Prof Dr Jamal Othman said companies affected may consider job cuts to cope with the financial impact of Covid-19.
“From the results that we have, the tourism sector is the most affected. If companies respond rationally from a business perspective, they may need to shed some of their employees."

Still a laughing stock, the rakyat the joke on Malaysia has ended when PH won 2 years, but the joke on rakyat has just begun.
Worst, aside from cheating the rakyat, Mahathir has cheated almost everyone. He hijacked the PH government noticing UMNO's imminent loss in the last general election. Won the election became the PM, exonerate himself for all BN wrongdoings under his 20 years rule during BN's time. And then take the nation for a ride, 5 years later, jump ship again back to BN, and form a new coalition to win the next general election. He did all this just to protect himself, his sons and cronies from being jailed along with Najib when the PH government sweeping the nation to weed out corruption.

The main culprit is MAHATHIR. Azmin is the patsy. A tool!
Think about it,
Why would Mahathir resign now if he is for the nation?
Why would Mahathir resign now leaving Pakatan Harapan/Malaysia in shamble? He could have said ""Ok, all plans are off, follow the original plan of power transition in November, it's for the better of the nation"" but shockingly he didn't do this. Why?
He purposefully resigned, to destroy Pakatan Harapan and the government indirectly so that he won't be blamed for being a traitor to the nation and people of Malaysia. He will be a laughing stock of the world if he follows the plan leading the new coalition to topple the current government.
His resignation meant the new coalition plan still intact, as he can't get the job done (It's too shameful for him to do so). So resignation is plan B. We the people are still sleeping thinking he is the angel from heaven. Looking back, there were people trying to nominate him for Nobel peace prize, what an f-ing joke that would have been.
If Azmin and Hishammuddin having family members intermarried, don't you think Mahathir have much deep blood ties with UMNO members/leaders.
Mahathir is serving as a protector for many of the crooks in UMNO by becoming the PM. He hijacked the nation knowing that the empire he built has fallen. That's the most cunning and daring tricks he pulled to turn things around where he can almost see him and his sons walking into jail if he didn't do anything in the last General Election.
The coup cannot be succeeded without Azmin, Do you guys watch the movie infernal affairs? Azmin is like the mole the gangster boss planted in the police force.
Mahathir and UMNO leaders are the gangster bosses."

Conspiracy of Azmin, Hishamuddin, and Mokhzani (son of Mahathir).
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfT-UgPT_rQ
I think it has vindicated my suspicion Mahathir is the main culprit. He purposely resigned to destroy PH (incumbent government).
Malaysia better prepares for more chaos on the way. But I think this will be the ugliest fight in Malaysian history since 1997. I think a new General Election is on the way if the coup is successful. If the coup is not successful, since Mahathir's wolf tail already showing, he can't sit back and let his empire/sons fall. So, he will try something else to destroy PH anyway, therefore new General Election is imminent.
If PH failed and fall in this new general election, there's nothing left for Malaysia to fight for. It's better Malaysia split into 2, east and west. Let the corrupts take the already developed west Malaysia, the true Malaysian move to East Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak) and with the help of the international community, let's build a new Malaysia that's free of corruption. Let west Malaysia rot over time.
I think Sabah and Sarawak will be interested in leaving Malaysia for good. Malaysia Merdeka for more than 70 years and they have been poor for 70 years. Furthermore, the wealth of their natural resources has been robbed for 70 years. What good are they to continue to stay with Malaysia?"

I guess Mahathir dare not to go all in calling new GE because there's a big chance he will lose unless he partner UMNO and PAS which he will never ever join. That's why he proposed unity government. Mahathir has shown his weakness. He don't want new election but just want to remain as PM.
Then this is Pakatan Harapan chance to turn the table around. Reject the unity government plan entirely. Give Mahathir 2 choices only.
Come back to Pakatan, stay PM until next GE, Anwar stay low profile until next GE. sumbat najib and umno cronies masuk penjara dulu. Everything wait until next GE....
OR
Go ALL IN. Push for new general election now. Basically risking everything.
Mahathir will lose without UMNO and PAS
Mahathir will lost too without PH
So, again it will be UMNO, BN + PAS + SS vs PH - SS - BERS - 0.2 PKR.

First, you must understand why Azmin and Zuraida betrayed PH in the first place. They both complaining about being unfairly treated by PKR leadership, as they worked the hardest but not rewarded.

No quality leaders, favorism, nepotism, jealousy was rife.
There's one very strange phenomena in political parties in Malaysia, the party is like gongsi gelap, these members of party get benefits if party won in election
This is something we don't see in western political parties, western political party leaders, they debates, giving speeches to win votes of public, not to win votes for support of party members
Like senators in U. S. , they don't hold important position in country, the president hired experts to run or give advise what to do.
But in Malaysia, MPs are hungry for position, so can give contracts to party members who give support.
Which will lead to corruption ultimately. If party members do not get the benifits they saught after, they will shake up the party, and leave ultimately destroying it.

(Reuters / Reuters March 03, 2020 01:10 am +08)
SINGAPORE (March 2): ING and Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) were the top creditors of Singapore commodity trader Agritrade International, which was last month placed under interim judicial management.
Documents reviewed by Reuters showed Malaysia's Maybank tops the list of secured lenders to Agritrade with US$118 million owed to it, with Dutch bank ING owed US$100 million.
The trading company has US$1.55 billion in outstanding liabilities to dozens of creditors, including US$983 million owed to secured lenders, an affidavit by Agritrade's chief executive officer Xinwei Ng dated Jan 16, showed.
A Maybank spokesman declined to comment on specific clients but said it ""has a stringent provisioning policy in place and takes appropriate measures as and when required to manage the asset quality of our entire credit portfolio"".
ING declined to comment.
In February, ING said provisions for bad loans rose in its fourth quarter, due in part to what it said was a single provision for a fraud case at a customer in Asia. ING did not disclose the identity of the customer.
French, Indian, Italian, Japanese, Chinese, the United Arab Emirates and Korean banks, along with 10 private funds are among Agritrade's other creditors, according to the list, which also included some global commodity traders.
Agritrade said in the affidavit it ran into financial problems around 2018, amid a declining commodities market and its funding issues were compounded after many banks halted funding.
""This situation was exacerbated by the sudden withdrawal of numerous credit lines by several of the company's bank lenders,"" Ng said, adding that the situation affected Agritrade's liquidity and its ability to fulfil its future commitments.
Agritrade International is the parent company of Hong Kong-listed Agritrade Resources Ltd. The firm was placed under interim judicial management in February, after the court dismissed an application for a debt moratorium.
Consulting firm EY told Reuters that the Singapore court had appointed its partners Angela Ee and Aaron Loh as interim judicial managers of Agritrade International.
Agritrade International said its primary assets are in the form of trade receivables and its shares in Agritrade Resources, according to the documents.
Agritrade International and Agritrade Resources did not respond to a request for comment.

He said this was in addition to the economic crisis, which was already having a significant impact on the rakyat.
Malaysian leaders are facing big challenges, said Najib, who listed jobs, income, government finances, people's aid, currency, trade, foreign relations, education, rural population and development in his Facebook post.

The Federal Reserve slashed its main interest rates to near zero in an emergency move. It's part of a broader government effort to ease the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
The central bank also announced several other actions, including letting banks borrow from the discount window for as long as 90 days.
President Donald Trump, who long called for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, said the move made him ""very happy.""
Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.
The Federal Reserve slashed its benchmark interest rate on Sunday by a full percentage point to near zero. The Fed's key rate is now 0% to 0.25%, matching the record low it was last at in 2015.
The central bank also said it will increase its bond holdings by $700 billion. The emergency moves are part of a broader government effort to ease the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
""The coronavirus outbreak has harmed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States,"" the central bank said in a statement on Sunday.
""Global financial conditions have also been significantly affected,"" it added. ""Available economic data show that the US economy came into this challenging period on a strong footing.""
President Donald Trump, who long called for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, said the move made him ""very happy.""
Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell in a news conference on Sunday added that the move was triggered because ""when stresses arise in the Treasury market, they can reverberate throughout financial markets and the entire economy.""
The central bank also announced several other actions, including letting banks borrow from the discount window for as long as 90 days and reducing reserve requirement ratios to zero percent. In addition, it united with five other central banks to ensure dollars are available around the world via swap lines."

The Dow Jones rallied back on Thursday as regulatory filings showed that billionaires like Warren Buffett are buying the stock market dip.

* Optimism emerged on Wall Street as stock market volatility finally dropped.
* The Dow Jones rallied back from three-year lows as billionaires like Warren Buffett and Carl Icahn started buying the dip.
* Dow bulls must still endure horrendous economic data over the coming weeks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) crept toward gains on Thursday as stock market bulls enjoyed a rare day of lower volatility.
Billionaire investors are eyeing China and starting to taste opportunity as the U.S. government begins to get its coronavirus outbreak under control.
The United States now has over 10,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. Despite the alarming rate of spread, this was an expected result of the government ramping up COVID-19 testing.
While the Dow’s previous rallies proved to be classic dead cat bounces, optimists are taking a look at China’s ability to slow the spread of COVID-19 and getting quite bullish about the fact that this crisis has a limited time-frame.
Naturally, a sizable chunk of these glass-half-full folks are multi-billionaires with plenty of cash on hand.
Carl Icahn, Warren Buffett, and Carlos Slim have all dived into the battered stock market recently."

KUALA LUMPUR (March 27): Based on corporate announcements and news flow today, companies that will be in focus on Monday (March 30) may include the following: Tenaga Nasional Bhd, Mlabs Systems Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd and Xin Hwa Holdings Bhd
Tenaga Nasional Bhd said it has set aside RM150 million following the Government’s stimulus announcement today that Malaysian households and businesses will get tiered rebates for six months on their electricity bills.
According to TNB, under the tiered rebate system, three million domestic consumers (with monthly consumption of below 200kWh) will receive a 50% rebate, while 1.5 million consumers (with monthly consumption between 201kWh and 300kWh) will get a 25% rebate. Another 2.2 million consumers (with monthly consumption between 301kWh and 600kWh) will get a 15% rebate.
Mlabs Systems Bhd is going to provide its video-conferencing products to Ipharmacare Malaysia Sdn Bhd to complement the latter's online pharmaceutical platform.
In return, Ipharmacare will support Mlab's efforts to promote these products, which will include but not limited to video conferencing systems, messaging systems and network solutions, to its platform users and/or independent pharmacies.
As the date of the group's annual general meeting (AGM) remains uncertain, Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) has decided to reclassify its final cash dividend of 39 sen per share to a second interim cash dividend of the same amount, to be paid on May 6, 2020.
Initially, the final cash dividend was proposed in the group’s fourth quarter 2019 results, for the approval of shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.
Xin Hwa Holdings Bhd announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary Xin Hwa Trading & Transport Sdn Bhd (XHTT) has been appointed by Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering Sdn Bhd as a subcontractor of logistics services.
While the contract has no firm value as it does not constitute a commitment for volume of orders, the company expects to generate revenue of about RM2 million per annum from the three-year contract."

* US stocks fell sharply on Wednesday after President Donald Trump told the country to brace for a ""very, very painful two weeks"" amid the coronavirus pandemic.
* The White House projected that the US could see 100,000 to 240,000 deaths from COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.
* The losses came on the heels of the worst-ever first quarter for the Dow Jones industrial average.
* Read more on Business Insider.
US stocks fell Wednesday after President Donald Trump issued a dire new warning about pain ahead due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Trump told Americans to brace for a ""very, very painful two weeks"" during a press briefing Tuesday evening, adding ""this is going to be three weeks like we've never seen before.""
The White House is now projecting that the US could see between 100,000 and 240,000 deaths from the coronavirus pandemic, peaking over the next two weeks. Right now, the US has 189,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, currently the largest outbreak in the world. As of April 1, 4,000 have died of coronavirus in the US.
Here's where major US indexes stood at the 4 p.m. ET market close on Wednesday:
* S&P 500: 2,470.50, down 4.4%
* Dow Jones industrial average: 20,943.51, down 4.4% (974 points)
* Nasdaq composite: 7,360.58, down 4.4%
Investor sentiment is falling as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic is ""maybe starting to hit home for people that had been hoping for better news,"" Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told Markets Insider in an interview.
The losses came after the Dow Jones industrial average posted its worst-ever quarterly performance on Tuesday, slipping more than 23%. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 also posted their worst monthly returns since the depth of the financial crisis in October 2008, falling 14% and 13% in March."

Imran Yassin expects BNM to slash another 25bps, bringing the OPR to 2.25% at the next MPC’s meeting.
“It is very unlikely that the OPR will go to zero because we opine that BNM will need to maintain some buffer to give them room to manoeuvre should the economic conditions worsen,” he said.
In a report, Hong Leong Investment Bank said BNM will likely reduce the policy rate by a total of 50bps this year to bring the rate down to 2% in 2020."

At 5pm, the FBM KLCI closed up 8.24 points, or 0.62% to 1,330.90. The benchmark index opened 2.04 points lower this morning.
Market breadth turned positive as gainers were on the upper hand against the losers on a ratio of 671-to-203 stocks. Traded volumes stood at 5.14 billion shares worth RM2.43bil.
Dealers said market sentiment was lifted by a rebound in crude oil prices on hopes for a deal to end the price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.
Crude futures surged after US President Donald Trump expressed optimism that a damaging price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia can be resolved.
Brent crude rose 8.97%, or US$2.22 to US$26.96 while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) advanced 8.67%, or US$1.76 to US$22.07.
Anchoring the gainers list on Bursa Malaysia is Nestle, which added RM1.70 to RM137.80, followed by Petronas Dagangan, rising RM1.32 to RM21.70 and QL Resources, gaining 40 sen to RM7.90.
Decliners on the broader market include Panasonic Manufacturing, declining 50 sen to RM103, PPB Group falling 12.5 sen to 82 sen and EIG, dropping 12 sen to 39 sen.
On the external front, Chinese shares ended higher with the Shanghai Composite index rising 1.69% at 2,780.64. The blue-chip CSI300 index was up 1.62%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was up 194.27 points, or 0.84%, at 23,280.06, Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 1.37% to 17,818.72 while South Korea’s Kospi added 2.34% to 1,724.86."

Kings, Queen, prime ministers, celebrities, news anchors reportedly infected with covid-19, but still can do interview, publicly shake hands, not wearing mask, appear like a thousand buck on TV and then recovered without a scratch. So much publicity. The media even more funnier, headlines like below
- Covid-19 death more than 9/11...
What!?!? They trying to spin this as terror attacks, aiming china?
- new trend - not made in china...
Again aiming at china, to undermine china economy, trying to pull manufacturing back to u.s.
- U.S. and Malaysia both says covid cases will peak in mid april...
Why mid April, how can they compares Malaysia and u.s., are the governments in bed? and coordinating when the economy should come back online?
All this shit show looks a lot like undermining china economy and crashing the stock market. Sound familar? Because the same tactic being used back in 2008? Did they (u.s.) release a virus bomb in china? and thank god china survived. If now, it back fires on themselves, serves them right.
China better be careful going forward, because U.S. has no intention to make peace with China. A virus bomb had been dropped into the center of china, china can survive this time, might not be so lucky next time."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000318.jsp?ftp=228","Apr 3, 2020 6:46 AM","RedEagle","NEW YORK, April 2 (Reuters) - Crude prices posted their biggest-one day gains on record on Thursday after President Donald Trump said he expects Russia and Saudi Arabia to announce a major oil production cut, and Saudi state media said the kingdom was calling an emergency meeting of producers to deal with the market turmoil.
Trump said he had spoken to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and expects Saudi Arabia and Russia to cut oil output by as much as 10 million to 15 million barrels, as the two countries signaled willingness to make a deal.
Trump did not specify barrels per day (bpd), though the market expresses demand and supply in those terms.
Such a sizeable deal, however, would likely require participation from other big producers outside of the OPEC cartel.
Saudi Arabia said it would call an emergency meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Saudi state media reported.
The Wall Street Journal reported that the kingdom would consider dropping output to roughly 9 million bpd, or about 3 million bpd less than what it planned on pumping in April.
Brent futures rose US$5.20, or 21.0%, to settle at US$29.94 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose US$5.01, or 24.7%, to settle at US$25.32.
Despite the huge gains, oil prices have still lost more than half their value this year.
The market slumped in early March, when Saudi Arabia and Russia were unable to come to terms on a deal to curb production, and the Saudis boosted output to more than 12 million bpd and shipped discounted cargoes worldwide.
Since then, the coronavirus pandemic has severely cut fuel demand. US crude prices fell under US$20 per barrel a few times in recent days.
""The question will come down to, Will they be able to agree to something? It's taken a couple of weeks of Brent at US$25 and WTI at US$20 and it seems as if the Russians are more approachable than they were a month ago,"" said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
Brent soared as much as 47% during the session, its highest intraday percentage gain ever. WTI jumped as much as 35%, its second highest ever, after an intraday gain of 36% on March 19.
Oil prices pulled back from those highs as traders questioned whether Russia and Saudi Arabia could actually agree on such a big production cut.
A senior administration official told Reuters the United States does not know formal details of Saudi Arabian and Russian plans to reduce oil supply yet and will not ask US domestic oil producers to chip in with their own cuts.
""Despite today’s headlines, we remain skeptical that a deal to cut output will materialize,"" analysts at Capital Economics said, noting Saudi Arabia is unlikely to cut output unless Russia and possibly other non-OPEC producers, like the United States and Canada, join in a coordinated reduction.
With fuel demand expected to fall by 20% to 30% in coming months, pressure was building on oil producers to reach a deal, and Trump expressed growing frustration about the crude price and its effect on the energy industry.
Texas regulators are exploring the possibility of cutting production in that state, which produces more than 5 million bpd."

Thursday's videoconference meeting between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies including Russia is expected to be more successful than their gathering in March, which ended in a failure to extend supply cuts and a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.
""The coming extraordinary producing-countries meeting is the only hope on the horizon for the market,"" said Bjornar Tonhaugen of Rystad Energy.
""Nobody wants to go short ahead of what could be a 'positive surprise' by OPEC++.""
Brent crude (LCOc1) was down 9 cents, or 0.3%, at $31.78 by 0837 GMT after falling 3.6% on Tuesday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) rose 94 cents to $24.87.
Crude has collapsed in 2020 because of a slide in demand due to the coronavirus outbreak and excess supply. Brent dropped to $21.65, its lowest since 2002, on March 30.
While OPEC sources have said a deal to cut production is conditional on the participation of the United States, doubts remain as to whether Washington will contribute.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Tuesday U.S. output was already declining, without government action.
U.S. crude production is expected to slump by 470,000 bpd and and demand is set to drop by about 1.3 million bpd in 2020, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Tuesday.
Before the OPEC and other producers' meeting, the latest round of U.S. oil inventory data will be in focus on Wednesday.
In a sign of excess supply, the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said U.S. crude inventories jumped by 11.9 million barrels. The government's supply report is due at 1430 GMT."

Oil ministers will be brushing up on their video conference skills tonight.
OPEC+ will hold its virtual meeting Thursday that many (bulls) are hoping will result in production cuts to stabilize the market.
WTI futures spiked 11% in late trading as Algeria revved up expectations, saying “massive” output cuts were on the cards, which could be around 10 million barrels per day.
That added to enthusiasm about Russia planning to offer cuts of 1.6 million barrels, Reuters reported, citing a Kremlin source.
U.S. participation could be the key to whether a deal goes through. But the world’s largest crude producer signaled it will contribute about 1.2 million bpd at most in cuts that would be market driven, not an official reduction."

Weird, Chinese gov only aware of the outbreak in late December, how can the US already tracking it in November? Somehow they have advance knowledge of the outbreak. This also make sense why CDC pull out from China months before the outbreak.
This actually turning more heads, and means what the chinese minister saying that the virus was brought in by U. S. military during a competition in wuhan during the same period is true.
China have no one to blame themselves, how can they be so stupid, U. S. clearly want you dead under trump, still you let US military into heart of China. Giving enemy the perfect opportunity to release a virus bomb, for maximum damage.

Before this three-week stretch of 16.8 million of initial jobless claims, there were already 7.1 million unemployed Americans as of March 13, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

There's truth to this. Among other things, it's also to do with the `dengki' factor. From a country looked down upon for decades as ""communists, peasants, country bumkins"" to becoming a major economic force in the world.
It's not just the US but also westerners. Especially the entitled right-wing types who resent they aren't automatically treated with respect and deference by the previously `inferior' Asians. It used to be like that - if you are White, you are treated like royalty. Well, not anymore, and they hate losing this white privilege. So, China becomes a target where anything negative is magnified."

BNM expected to cut OPR by another 75 basis points — CGS-CIMB

-A+A
KUALA LUMPUR (April 23): CGS-CIMB Securities Sdn Bhd said today it expects Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) to cut the overnight policy rate (OPR) by another 75 basis points (bps) in anticipation of a contraction in the country’s economy in 2020 and subdued inflation during the year.
CGS-CIMB economists Michelle Chia and Lim Yee Ping wrote in a note that the nation’s monetary policy is likely to become more accommodative and CGS-CIMB expects BNM to reduce the OPR by 50bps this May, followed by a further 25bps cut in the second half of 2020."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000318.jsp?ftp=232","Apr 29, 2020 7:31 AM","smallbird9","For sure BNM will continue with more OPR cuts to shore up the economy and SMEs. Do u know what OPR reduction means to all banks in Malaysia? That means banks will earn a lot less on interests income. That is just one reason why banks will suffer more.
How about Non Performing Loans (NPL), personal or business mortgage/loan defaults, bank industry's profit margin compression? To add matters worse, banks could reduce dividends or cancelled all dividends to preserve their capitals. Do u not know in Europe they passed the law to forbid banks to give out dividends? In Australia, NAB also does the same. U think Maybank the highest capped listed company in Bursa will not mitigate their own risks which are obvious already? Think carefully."

Suppose u borrow a conventional loan from the bank for Rm 500k at 4% pa for 30 years. Your instalment is rm 3100 per month and your current outstanding is Rm 300k.
Suppose the bank give u 6 months morotarium u no need service your loan instalment of rm 3100 u will conserve cash of roughly rm 18.6k but then your outstanding loan would have grown to rm 306k bcos of not paying your instalment, after 6 months u continue service your loan again at rm 3100 per month and u will take about slightly about 6 months longer to completely payoff your loan loh...!!
Notice the morotarium is to help u to conserve cash of rm 18.6k and not complete interest waiver for u mah...!!
So the same should applies to hire purchase loan & islamic loan, u must be responsible to payback the bank with cost but without penalty for the extension of loan repayment loh.
U cannot say u do not want to bear the interest cost and the bank cannot charge u penalty interest for delay payment mah...!!
So long as the bank did not charge u higher rate, u should be responsible to pay the bank at the existing interest rates loh...!!

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000318.jsp?ftp=234","May 12, 2020 11:37 AM","crywithouttears","KUALA LUMPUR: Dropping accrued interest of hire-purchase (HP) loans and fixed-rate Islamic financing will be more negative for Public Bank Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd, AMMB Holdings Bhd and Hong Leong Bank Bhd.
Affin Hwang Capital named the four as those with the highest exposure to HP loans particularly.
Public Bank has the highest exposure with HP loans making up 15.7 per cent or RM51.77 billion of its total outstanding loans as at end-2019.
HP loans accounted for RM49.9 billion or 9.5 per cent of Maybank's total outstanding loans in Malaysia of RM523.49 billion as at end-2019, Affin Hwang said.
The firm said the banking sector would have to take a larger impact of a ""modification loss'"" on their income statements if Bank Negara Malaysia heeds the Finance Ministry's call to waive the accrued interest.
A ""modification loss"" is the difference in the gross carrying amount of a loan (or financial asset) based on the difference between the present value (PV) of the modified contractual cash flows vis-à-vis the PV of the original contractual cash flows before any modification to the terms of the loan.
""Public Bank, Hong Leong Bank, Maybank. Affin Bank and AMMB may potentially have a larger modification loss being recognised in their income statement vis-à-vis banks with more variable rate loans arising from the moratorium period granted,"" Affin Hwang said today.
The firm maintained its sector ""underweight"" call, as it expects a deterioration in earnings while the introduction of additional measures by Bank Negara had put further pressure on banks' liquidity and funding.
Putra Business School associate Prof Dr Ahmed Razman Abdul Latiff estimated that banks would incur some RM2 billion income losses if the accrued interest on the loans is lifted.
Banks that offer predominantly fixed rate financing would suffer more, he added.
Razman said interestingly, the major shareholders of all nine local banks listed on Bursa Malaysia were government institutions such as the Employees Provident Fund, Permodalan Nasional Bhd and Khazanah Nasional Bhd.
""Therefore, if these banks post reduced profits for the year, their depositors and investors will receive lower dividends.""
Razman said Bank Negara must understand that the moratorium was introduced because some individuals were having hard times paying their loans during the Movement Control Order.

But the idea that America’s central bank should set benchmark interest rates below zero — which is to say, that it should start taxing the reserves of commercial banks instead of paying interest on them — is not peculiar to Trump. In fact, many respected economists believe that the U.S. should embrace the policy, which is already in effect in Europe and Japan. Further, as of earlier this week, Wall Street investors were betting that the Fed will bring interest rates below zero by mid-2021 in order to promote recovery from the coronavirus crisis."

The Trump administration has increased the pressure on Huawei by tightening export controls on the Chinese telecoms group and its suppliers, heightening tensions with Beijing that have flared during the coronavirus pandemic.
The US commerce department accused Huawei of continuing to use American technology in its semiconductor designs, despite having been subject to export controls since May 2019.
The move to close loopholes in those controls came at the end of a week in which the Trump administration prevented a government pension fund from investing in Chinese stocks and President Donald Trump suggested the US could “cut off the whole relationship” with China."

And this week, China announced an anti-dumping probe into barley exports and the suspension of meat imports from four Australian processing plants.
The big ticket items of iron ore, coal and natural gas that China needs to build and fuel its economy have so far remained unmentioned. But the barley and beef blows -- which authorities from both sides have sought to downplay -- can be interpreted as shots across the bow of Australia’s economy."

“Buffett still has basically his biggest investment in history in the banks. That’s quite a statement. He’s not afraid to bail when something’s not going the way it should. The best investor of all time has his biggest investment ever, less 3%, in banks. Maybe he knows something the market is missing,” Mayo told CNBC in an email.
Mayo notes that Buffett’s holdings remain in Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, and M&T Bank. Berkshire also built higher stakes in PNC and U.S. Bancorp, Mayo added."

This took into account the impact of the RM1 billion “modification loss” arising from the hire purchase portfolio and higher net credit cost of 80bps to 89bps in 2020 to 2021, versus 52bps to 55bps previously, on additional provisions for ""forward-looking assumptions"" of weaker macroeconomic variables, Tan said in a note to investors today.
She has projected Maybank’s net profit at RM4.88 billion in FY20, and RM6.17 billion in FY21, on revenue of RM22.72 billion and RM24.12 billion respectively.
Tan noted that Maybank’s management is undertaking a more conservative provisioning stance, and has set a net credit cost (NCC) guidance of 75bps to 100bps for 2020 while expecting NCC to stay elevated in 2021.
With the group’s dividend expected to come down come down by between 4% and 5.7% in 2020 to 2021, she said there could be risks of downward selling pressure on the stock. The upside risk include lower credit default risks.
Tan has maintained a 'sell’ rating with a lower target price (TP) of RM5.80, based on a P/BV (price-to-book value) target of 0.77 times with a 2021 BVPS (Book value per share) of RM7.51."

LONDON/SYDNEY (May 26): World shares forged ahead on Tuesday and commodity markets drove higher as well, as investors disregarded Sino-US tensions to focus on more stimulus in China and a re-opening world economy.
Britain's FTSE and Japan's Nikkei led their regions with 2.2% gains, while US S&P 500 futures cleared the 3,000 level for the first time since early March, when the economic impact of the coronavirus was just becoming clear.
Europe's early spurt saw the STOXX 600 score a near 11-week high. Travel and leisure stocks jumped almost 6% after Spain had said quarantine-free tourism would resume next month.

Do we need to pay tax on the above dividend income?"

Can anyone explain what is the above means? Does it means Maybank giving RM0.25 dividend or giving us some share quantity that equivalent to RM0.25?"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000318.jsp?ftp=236","May 28, 2020 2:12 PM","harold8990","Samheong78, from what i know, we dont have to pay tax for that..unlike REITs then we need to pay tax on the dividend which will be cut straightaway from the dividend before it is credited to you..Dividend Reinvestment plan means you have the option of allocating an approved portion of your dividend to buy Maybank shares at a discounted price, with an approved limit given by the house..this means that your average price for maybank shares will become lower and lower the longer you keep your shares."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000318.jsp?ftp=236","May 28, 2020 4:58 PM","WinnerWay","samheong78, for REIT if there is no tax on the income if more than 90% of its income is distributed out to its shareholder which means that the tax obligation now is on the shareholder. And for the dividend you earn from those listed companies, you don't have to pay anymore tax as they already taxed before the dividend is distributed to your account. There is no double taxation in Malaysia, either tax upfront or later."

Before you take a new loan, make sure you have enough money in your bank to pay the loan in the event you lose your job. It is also your responsibility to make sure you have an insurance policy to cover any unforeseen circumstances.

KUALA LUMPUR, July 5 — DAP secretary-general Lim Guan Eng has backed those calling the federal government to consider extending the moratorium on loan repayments slated to end in September by at least another six months.
Lim, who is also Bagan MP, cited how unemployment rates have gone up from 3.2 per cent in January to 5 per cent in April, with April’s figure amongst the highest in the recent decades.
“It will continue to go higher because many companies are still in the process of retrenching their employees. At a time when the economy is getting worse, many Malaysians and local businesses are not prepared to face the moratorium’s expiration.
“I hope the government will extend the moratorium period until the country’s economy begins to recover,” he said in a statement on Facebook here.
Under the Prihatin Rakyat Economic Stimulus Package’s (Prihatin), Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) has proposed an automatic moratorium on all loan repayments by individuals and small and medium enterprises for six months from April 1 until September 30.
The former finance minister said any form of extension will help ordinary Malaysians plan their financial obligations properly and lighten the burden.
“There is no use in bankrupting anyone and exacerbating the economic downturn that we are weathering through at the moment,” he added.
He added that the six-month moratorium was estimated to cost RM100 billion, according to the prime minister.
“As reported by the finance minister, as much as RM47.5 billion have been utilised as of June 19. I am confident that the government could do much more,” Lim added.
It was reported on Friday that BNM said it was unlikely that financial institutions would extend the six-month moratorium on the payment of monthly instalments for vehicles and housing loans which will end on September 30.
BNM assistant governor Adnan Zaylani Mohamad Zahid reportedly said that the economic recovery would continue and that BNM has no intention of extending the moratorium as it would have repercussions that it wanted to avoid.
Adnan’s statement was consistent with Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz, who on June 28 said that it is up to the banks if they wish to extend the loan moratorium in a targeted way.
Tengku Zafrul was quoted as saying that the targeted moratorium extension should be looked at by banks on a case-by-case basis."

Market outlook
The End To U.S. Dollar Hegemony Has Arrived
Jul. 28, 2020 11:46 AMFXA, FXB, FXC
Summary
With gold at an all-time high, the U.S. dollar appears to be entering a clear inflationary bear market.
While all major currencies have seen money supply expansion, the U.S. M1 has increased at a significantly greater pace than peers.
U.S. real yields are at an all-time low and are trending lower, while Europe and Japan's are trending higher.
Renewed U.S.-China tensions may exacerbate the dollar's declines as Russia and China create an alternative payment system.
This situation is likely bullish for foreign equity ETFs, U.S. commodity producers, and foreign currency funds."

Here are my top 5 reasons:
1. Use Of Chinese Currency Growing In Africa
Who do you think Africa's biggest trading partner is? Spoiler alert, it isn't the United States.
In 2009, China became Africa's biggest trading partner, and the country is now aggressively seeking to expand the use of the Chinese currency on the African continent.
A report from Africa's largest bank, Standard Bank, recently stated:
""We expect at least $100 billion (about R768 billion) in Sino-African trade...to be settled in the renminbi by 2021.""
China seems absolutely determined to change the way that international trade is conducted. At this point, approximately 70,000 Chinese companies are using the Chinese currency in cross-border transactions.
A number of countries in Africa, among them the Bank of Ghana, are using the RMB as part of their settlement and reserve currency. Earlier this year, the Nigerian central bank reportedly announced that it planned to shift more of its foreign reserves into yuan from dollars as the RMB gains greater traction in global trade."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000318.jsp?ftp=241","Aug 1, 2020 8:23 PM","masterus","2. India To Use Gold To Buy Oil From Iran
Iran has been one of the most aggressive nations to move away from the U.S. dollar in international trade. For example, it has been reported that India will begin to use gold to buy oil from Iran.
Things don't just end there. Reports are also saying that China is more than happy to deal with Iran in their own currency, pushing the wedge that much deeper between Iran and the U.S. after the U.S. exited the 2008 nuclear agreement and started applying sanctions on Iran."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000318.jsp?ftp=241","Aug 1, 2020 8:24 PM","masterus","3. Saudi Arabia Likely to Abandon Use of Petrodollar in Dealings With China
Who imports the most oil from Saudi Arabia? It is not the United States, it is China.
Saudi Arabia and China have teamed up to construct a massive new oil refinery in Saudi Arabia. So the question becomes, how long is Saudi Arabia going to stick with the Petrodollar if China is their most important customer?
This is also spelling danger for the Petrodollar, which has been a key player in the U.S. economy since the Nixon administration, when Henry Kissinger brokered the deal back in the 1970s. However, the expiration date on this deal may be fast approaching."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000318.jsp?ftp=241","Aug 1, 2020 8:25 PM","masterus","4. The United Nations and IMF are Pushing for a New World Reserve Currency
The UN has been issuing reports that openly call for an alternative to the U.S. dollar as the reserve currency of the world. One UN report in particular envisions ""a new global reserve system...that no longer relies on the United States dollar as the single major reserve currency.""
That may be bold enough, however, the IMF has taken it one step further. One IMF paper entitled ""Reserve Accumulation and International Monetary Stability"" actually proposed a future global currency named the ""Bancor"" and stated that a future global central bank could be put in charge of issuing it."

The BRICS (these countries include Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) continue to flex their muscles. An agreement will promote the use of their own national currencies when trading with each other rather than the U.S. dollar. The following is from a news source in India:
""The five major emerging economies of BRICS are set to inject greater economic momentum into their grouping by signing two pacts for promoting intra-BRICS trade...The two agreements will enable credit facility in local currency for businesses of BRICS countries... this is expected to scale up intra-BRICS trade that has been growing at the rate of 28% over the last few years but, at $230 billion, remains much below the potential of the five economic powerhouses."""

The euro, British pound, Japanese yen, Hong Kong dollar and Australian dollar are also not exempt from trading fees
China is waiving transaction fees between the yuan and 12 currencies, including the Singapore dollar, Russia rouble and Korean won, for three years in its onshore foreign exchange market in a clear move to skirt the US dollar.
The other nine currencies are the Malaysian ringgit, New Zealand dollar, South African rand, Saudi riyal, United Arab Emirates dirham, Polish zloty, Hungarian forint, Turkish lira and the Thai baht. The SAFE said the reason for waiving those trading fees was to “actively cooperate with the national belt and road development strategy, implement financial support for the development of the real economy, reduce corporate exchange costs, and promote the development of the direct exchange market for yuan and foreign exchange between banks”."

By William Gallagher
Describing them as ""untrusted Chinese apps,"" the US government says it wants WeChat, TikTok, and other unspecified services to be banned from all of the app stores in the US.
WeChat may be banned in the US
WeChat is available everywhere, but totally dominates in China
As Microsoft is in talks to buy TikTok. and Apple is not, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has unveiled plans to ban similar services that, he says, pose ""significant threats to the personal data of US citizens."""

Many are betting on the precious metal to continue rising, but the soaring prices have also enticed some investors to secure more immediate profits. In the UAE, for example, some customers have returned to the souks to sell their jewellery, bars and coins to take advantage of the high prices and get some much-needed cash.
“With oil prices down and [the] tourism sector severely impacted, many individuals in the UAE have lost their jobs or their business have been hugely impacted,” said Arun Leslie John, Chief Market Analyst at Century Financial. “These individuals in need of cash are now opting to sell some gold and [make] some gains after witnessing the massive rally in the metal over the past few days.”"

SCENARIO ONE: Nothing changes. The Hong Kong dollar peg is attacked and the HKMA defends it at all costs and will continue to do so until all the US$449 billion reserves are used up and the Hong Kong dollar craters. This is an extreme financial cold-war scenario, and the outcome depends on the White House not using its proverbial financial launch codes. But the events of the past week have revealed the vulnerability of the Hong Kong dollar peg, and the HKMA as its manager.
SCENARIO TWO: Hong Kong switches to the RMB. This could be done overnight through a new Hong Kong dollar pegged to the renminbi. The Hong Kong dollar would need to be exchangeable within Hong Kong and holders would be able to sell them back to banks in exchange for crisp People’s Bank of China renminbi notes. As for the US$449 billion reserves, that could fund the Lantau reclamation project six times over.
SCENARIO THREE: The Hong Kong dollar peg is modified along the lines of the Singapore dollar’s secret basket. The basket could be comprised of Asian currencies and perhaps some gold. Reliance on the US dollar is diminished and the Hong Kong dollar remains convertible. The HKMA potentially wins from this, and although baskets can be reverse engineered, it would be more difficult to attack. If the basket had a healthy amount of yen in it, there would be an element of self-hedging against the dollar as the US dollar tends to trade in a somewhat steady relationship with the yen at US$1=¥105-115."

BNM OPR seen lower at 1.50% by end-2020 as MGS yields fall to record low — RAM
KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 19): Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) may cut the overnight policy rate (OPR) to 1.50% by end of this year as Malaysian Government Securities' (MGS) yields fall to record lows amid the abundance of global liquidity, according to RAM Rating Services Bhd.
RAM economist Woon Khai Jhek wrote in a note today RAM expects domestic bond yields to stay suppressed amid the abundance of global liquidity and that RAM is not discounting another round of OPR cuts by BNM.
""We think (the) OPR could possibly end 2020 at 1.50%,” Woon said.
""In line with robust foreign demand, yields trended down through July. This broad-based decline was also driven by BNM’s fourth rate cut this year, for a total of 125 bps year to date. The benchmark interest rate stands at 1.75% — the lowest since the introduction of this policy tool in 2004. Concurrently, the benchmark 10-year MGS yield fell to a record low of 2.62% as at end-July (-32.2 bps m-o-m) while the shorter-term one-year MGS hit a fresh low of 1.78% (-26.9 bps m-o-m),” he said.
According to Woon, regional (Asian) bond markets have seen a recent resurgence of foreign interest as sentiment improved on the resumption of economic activities.
Another driving factor is the ample global liquidity from quantitative easing, he said.
Woon said Malaysian bonds registered their third consecutive net foreign inflow in July 2020 at RM7.1 billion.
""Consequently, foreign holdings of MGS/GII rose to 23.5% of the total outstanding (bonds) in July, close to the 23.9% in February — pre-Covid-19. In contrast, the participation rate in Thailand and Indonesia stayed on a downtrend despite also seeing a consistent return of foreign demand,” he said.
GII stands for Islamic-based Government Investment Issues, according to BNM’s website.

The total loan exposure of US$350 million, or RM1.45 billion, consists of US$250 million unsecured loans. Analysts estimate the exposure to be about 26 to 29 basis points (bps) of Maybank’s gross loans.
At RHB, the banking group’s loan exposure to GENT HK is US$100 million, Bloomberg data shows. This is estimated to be equivalent to about 22 to 25 bps of the group’s gross loan portfolio.
Analysts opine that loan loss provision is inevitable for the two banking groups in view that GENT HK is currently in the rough waters as the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a heavy toll on the cruise industry."

We’re Re-Optimising Your Portfolios for Uncertain Times Ahead
Freddy Lim
Freddy Lim
CO-FOUNDER AND CIO
14 May 2020
Though the March market crash was paralysingly fast compared to the 2008 financial crisis, the depth of the market crash was not as pronounced as that of the 2008 recession. This time around, central banks matched the speed of the recent crash with quick economic stimulus packages. The fast responses prevented a steeper and more prolonged market crash as the market quickly priced in an average recession, rather than a deep recession. Still, the depth of the oncoming recession remains unclear for now. With that said, we know that the markets and the economy will eventually recover, though we don’t know what the path to recovery will look like.
Our investment framework, ERAA®, has analysed the latest economic and market data; we are now re-optimising our portfolios to better prepare them for what lies ahead by reducing US Dollar exposure, increasing Chinese exposure, and for some portfolios, increasing exposure to Gold. This is the second time we have re-optimised our portfolios since our launch in Malaysia in November 2018."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000318.jsp?ftp=244","Aug 24, 2020 11:15 AM","masterus","Decreasing USD exposure
In our re-optimisation in August 2019, ERAA® increased the overall US Dollar exposure across all risk points, taking account of the broad economic uncertainty. ERAA® did this because, as the US Dollar is seen as a safe-haven currency, it tends to appreciate when the markets get more nervous."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000318.jsp?ftp=244","Aug 24, 2020 11:16 AM","masterus","We are now reducing our US Dollar exposure. There’s a ton of money being “printed” in the economy right now because of the economic stimuli. While many governments are taking economic measures, the US Government and the Federal Reserve have been particularly aggressive. Although the stimuli are in place to prevent a deeper recession, they could also lead to significant depreciation of the USD as the economy gradually recovers. We saw this depreciation happen after the US Federal Reserve introduced quantitative easing in March 2009. Then, the US Dollar depreciated by 21.2% versus the Ringgit between March 2009 and July 2011."

(1) The ""no interim dividend has been recommended"" is directly quoted from Bursa's Listing Requirements Appendix 9B Part A Note 13(a)(i). They could have worded it differently, and it would have meant the same thing.
(2) Any recommendation or declaration of dividend and distribution must be disclosed to Bursa immediately. The same applies to ""any recommendation or decision that a dividend will not be declared"" and ""any proposed issue or offer of securities"". Any attempt to withhold information would be in breach with the listing regulations. Not to say it hasn't been done though.
(3) Traditionally, all bonus issues and right issues done by Maybank had had their proposals announced with the release of the QR. Refer to the QR and rights issues proposal dated 27 Feb 2009, QR and bonus issues proposal dated 15 Nov 2007, and QR and bonus issues proposal dated 28 Aug 2001.
(4) Interim cash dividends indeed do not need shareholders' approval. However, any listing of shares more than 10% of the total number of issued shares do need such approval pursuant to Paragraph 6.03(1) in the listing requirements. GMs have been convened for all the proposals in (3) for that purpose.
(5) EPF and KWAP has been buying PADINI for quite some time now. They just released a QR on 26th that outright said ""there will be no dividend for the current quarter"" while also reporting losses. EPF and KWAP buying is not always indicative of a company's performance in the short term.
(6) Price movements don't always tell something. Back in May GDEX's price spiked before QR, then the QR came out looking suboptimal. The price has not peaked that high again since. There are probably many other cases like that, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. If you bet blindly every time just because the price went up, you'll likely end up getting trapped pretty frequently. But I could be wrong this time. Make your own judgement.
(7) Voicing opinion is fine, but doing it with such a condescending tone will just come across as rude. I understand this is the internet, but it doesn't hurt to put more attention into our own words. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Please think about it.
(8) I am not always right. If there is indeed a rights issue or bonus issue coming down the road, great! But I don't think it's wise to bank on it just because the price didn't go down as expected. Again, I could be wrong, make your own judgement."

It is important for banks to have adequate capital buffer. Even MAS Singapore restricted their banks dividend payout to mitigate against any unfavourable and unforesee economic developments in 2020 & 2021. Overpayment of dividend and not maintaining sufficient cash reserve will not protect PLCs during economic upheaval eg. Aviation sector. Also, overpayment of dividend not via increased earnings will not be sustainable going forward as the resultant capital loss due to share price reduction will outweigh the meagre dividends received by minority shareholders. Maybank also had the unfortunate Hyflux Singapore and Genting Hong Kong huge loan position too."

There are 11.241 Billion shares in Maybank, so your Directors generosity has cost shareholders about RM 6.664 Billion to date (excluding the interim dividend loss).
Now, some of you may ask were your Directors acting in your best interests when they gave away your Capital value and income? Personally I don't think so, if I want to be generous I will give to my favorite charity not have my Directors give away my money to people with BMWs and 3 houses.

TV host says the top crypto will reach all-time high in near term as world loses confidence in reserve currency
By PAUL MUIR
SEPTEMBER 1, 2020
The US dollar is becoming so enfeebled by excess printing that even billionaire investor Warren Buffett is jumping ship. But this debasement of the world’s reserve currency is good news for bitcoin holders, according to analyst and TV presenter Max Keiser, because it will push its price to all-time highs.

No amount of financial/economic gerrymandering (""penjana"" - since the idea is borrow more and bank provide more, let's see if it works) will be able to drive the machine if the vehicle are the financial institutions.
For investors, just be glad that they didn't extend the moratorium. Also, the recent changes to insolvency act also means bank can't just write off certain bad loans. As for borrowers, nothing is ever free LOL!

I will be looking to buy into banks eventually for a long term investment, ie. capital growth and annual dividends but I'm not yet convinced that this is the ideal time.

By DALJIT DHESI
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2020/09/21/budget-20...
PETALING JAYA: Budget 2021, which will be tabled in November, will be expansionary though narrower than Budget 2020, with economists projecting a budget deficit of 4% to 6% next year.
The government, they said, would need to revitalise the economy with appropriate measures due to the uncertainties arising from the Covid-19 and the weak global economy, which has caused many nations to fall into recession.
The World Bank expects Malaysia’s fiscal deficit to gross domestic product (GDP) to widen to 7% this year, underpinned by increased expenditure and downward pressure on revenue. The government, however, expects the fiscal deficit to be at 5.8% to 6% this year.
Economists expect the government to look into some core areas to ensure Malaysia is on the right track to achieve economic sustainability post-pandemic.
Socio-Economic Research Centre executive director Lee Heng Guie told StarBiz that the federal government is torn between managing a tight fiscal space and keeping the country’s sovereign rating intact.
""In our view, the government should go for another year of fiscal deficit targeted at public spending and programmes as well as the provision of tax incentives and allowances to boost private investment, creating jobs and income."

In a statement today, its general-secretary J Solomon said thousands of lowly-paid workers had either lost their jobs or are clinging to it, making them unable to service their loans at this time.

KUALA LUMPUR (Oct 31): Malaysia reported 659 new Covid-19 infections today, 80.3% or 529 of which came from the worst-hit state of Sabah, while the Klang Valley contributed 10.6% or 70 cases. This raised the country's cumulative positive cases to 31,548, according to the Ministry of Health (MoH).
The number of recoveries hit 1,000 today — the country's highest so far in a day — as recoveries exceeded new infections for the second day in the past four days; on Thursday, recoveries came in at 685 versus 649 new infections.
This means a total of 21,248 patients have recovered so far, yielding a recovery rate of 67.4% of total confirmed cases.
As for active cases, which carry transmission risk, the tally is now down to 10,051 from 10,392 yesterday.
The death toll, meanwhile, remained at 249 or 0.8% of total infections, with no new additions.
No new infection clusters were reported today, according to the MoH. This means the number of active clusters remains at 33, while 114 clusters have ended.
In Sabah, 205 cases originated from existing clusters, while 203 cases were discovered via contact tracing and 121 infections were discovered from other Covid-19 screening tests.
Selangor saw 55 new cases, 18 of which came from existing clusters, followed by 22 from contact tracing, and 15 from other Covid-19 tests.
Labuan and Kuala Lumpur saw 12 and 11 cases respectively, followed by Sarawak (nine cases), Perak (six), Putrajaya (four), Kedah (two), Pulau Pinang (two), Terengganu (two), Pahang (one) and Kelantan (one).
Meanwhile, 137 cases or 20.8% of total infections today were linked to the prison clusters and temporary detention centres, namely the Kepayan cluster (26 cases) and the Rumah Merah cluster (111 cases).
Of the 659 cases reported today, one was an imported infection involving a foreigner who travelled from Bangladesh.
Declining R0
During the question and answer (Q&A) session today, MoH director-general Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said Malaysia's R0, which measures the contagiousness of the virus, was brought down to 1.5 last week — from 2.2 at the start of the third wave of infections. A higher R0 translates into a higher rate of infection in the community.
For comparison, the second wave had an R0 rate of 3.55.
“Based on the projection for R0 of 1.5, daily new cases should be 1,357. If the R0 is 1.0, it should be 950 cases per day. However, we have been seeing daily cases of below 950 — at 799 yesterday and 659 today. So our R0 is currently below 1.0.
“This means that the measures that have been enforced under the CMCO (conditional movement control order) for the past two weeks — that is, by allowing economic sectors to operate while toning down social, education and sports activities — have resulted in a lower rate of infection,” he added.

* Saturday, 31 Oct 2020 7:00 PM MYT By TARRENCE TAN and AUSTIN CAMOENS
https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/10/31/covid-19-malaysia-on...
PUTRAJAYA: Despite daily three-digit Covid-19 infection figures in the country, Health director-general Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah says Malaysia is on the road of recovery.
This was because the projected figures were much lower than expected, as the Health Ministry was predicting a four-digit spike of 1,357 cases on Thursday (Oct 29), based on the 1.5 infectivity rate, or known as the R nought (R0), said Dr Noor Hisham.
If the R0 level was at 1.0, Dr Noor Hisham said Malaysia would have gotten 950 cases on Oct 30 and 955 cases on Oct 31.
“But, there were only 659 cases on Oct 31. This means our R0 level is less than 1.0, ” said Dr Noor Hisham during a press conference at the Health Ministry in Putrajaya on Saturday.
“This meant that the conditional movement control order (MCO) that allows only the economic sector to function has a positive effect on reducing our R0 level to 1, ” he added.
For an R0 level of 1, it means that each Covid-19 patient will infect one other person.
Dr Noor Hisham also credited the lowered R0 level to the efforts of the Health Ministry, adding that they are now targeting to reduce the infectivity level to 0.3.
Dr Noor Hisham also urged Malaysians to play their role in ensuring SOPs are adhered to in order to curb Covid-19."

By Anneken Tappe, CNN Business
Updated 1942 GMT (0342 HKT) November 2, 2020
https://edition.cnn.com/2020/11/02/investing/dow-stock-market-election...
New York (CNN Business)The Dow and S&P 500 were up on Monday, one day before Election Day, when Wall Street expects Joe Biden will win the presidency and Democrats will retake the Senate and maintain control of the House.
Stocks opened sharply higher before encountering some volatility and paring some gains.
The Dow (INDU) was still up 1.4%, or some 360 points, mid-afternoon. At its high point, the index gained more than 500 points. The broader S&P 500 (SPX) was up 0.9%.
Both benchmarks are retracing some of their losses from last week, when they recorded their worst week since March.
Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite (COMP) reversed its earlier gains and fell 0.2% in mid-afternoon trade.
Although stocks typically favor Republican policies, investors are eager for more fiscal stimulus, that will buoy an economy headed south once again as coronavirus cases soar. Investors predict a ""blue wave"" would lift the chances of a comprehensive stimulus deal getting passed in the winter.
A Biden win would also likely mean less news and headline risk for stocks in the term to come, investors believe.
""If the polls are roughly right, Joe Biden is going to win the election comfortably and we will know that before midnight tomorrow,"" said Andy Laperriere and Don Schneider at Cornerstone Macro.
Even if the polls are wrong, the evidence is still pointing to a Biden victory, they added. Prediction market PredictIt puts a Biden win at 65%.
""We have been emphasizing that the Senate outcome is important for the trajectory of fiscal policy,"" said Citi economist Andrew Hollenhorst in a note to clients, even though neither party is likely to get a filibuster-proof majority so bipartisan cooperation could still be needed for the next stimulus bill.
""Under any election scenario we expect a $1.5 trillion plus fiscal package, possibly as early as just post-election,"" Hollenhorst said.
Congress has been stuck on negotiating a second stimulus deal since the summer. Investors have been waiting for results, getting jumpy at any headlines about the progress. What this really tells us is that markets believe the US economy needs more help getting back on track as the effects of the CARES Act are running out.
So far the economy's improvements have been rather uneven. For example, millions of jobs have been added back since the spring lockdown, but the economy is still down more than 10 million jobs from February.
Millions of Americans still need government benefits to make ends meet, and that's bad news because the US economy relies heavily on consumer spending.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs (GS) expect consumer spending to wane in the coming months because of the Covid-19 resurgence is keeping people at home and any new stimulus package will probably take until 2021 to kick in.
And as if this election and its repercussions weren't enough for investors to think about, the week is also filled with important economic reports, including the October jobs report.
On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management reported that America's factories did better than economists had predicted in October. The sector's purchasing managers' index rose to 59.3 points from 55.4 points in September, its highest level since September 2018. Any value over 50 denotes an growth in the sector."

President and CEO Datuk Seri Ahmad Zaini Othman says MBSB expects to post a profit in the third quarter of the year ending Dec 31, 2020 (3QFY2020), for two main reasons — one, there will not be any modification loss in that quarter and, two, he expects the bank’s net operating income to be sustained as per the level of the second quarter.
“We also expect that gains from the sale of financial instruments will continue to contribute to the group’s total income,” he says in response to questions from The Edge.
The banking group, which is 65.4%-owned by the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), saw net profit rise to a five-year high of RM716.9 million in FY2019 before its fortunes turned this year, mainly because of the Covid-19 pandemic.
In 1QFY2020, the lender posted a net loss of RM73.25 million compared with a net profit of RM83.83 million in the same period a year earlier, due to higher impairment charges on loans, financing and advances. This was despite revenue rising 1.9% year on year to RM741.41 million.
Its net allowance for impairment charges almost doubled to RM291.78 million from RM153.02 million. This stemmed mainly from “property and construction financing, on the corporate side”, according to Ahmad Zaini.
And, in 2QFY2020, it made a net loss of RM121.51 million due to a hefty, one-off modification loss of RM512.61 million that arose because of the blanket loan repayment moratorium granted to customers. This was despite a 17% improvement in revenue to RM886.35 million.
Had it not been for the modification loss, the group would have been in a position of profit. The modification loss was hefty — by far the largest among the listed banking groups — due to its sizeable financing portfolio contracted at fixed-rate financing. In fact, 92% of the loss came from its fixed-rate personal financing business, which is its largest financing segment.
Going forward, Ahmad Zaini does not expect a marked rise in non-performing loans (NPLs) or provisions in 3QFY2020 as customers continued to come under the blanket moratorium until end-September, hence the status of the loans remained as “performing”.
These are not expected to rise significantly in 4QFY2020 either, he says. “We don’t think so, as our personal financing [repayments] are via a salary-deduction scheme. Maybe [some] in home loans, but that would be small.”
As at end-September, the take-up rate among customers for targeted assistance on financing is “not significant”, he says, without providing numbers.
In late August, MBSB had guided analysts that there would potentially be an additional RM30 million to RM50 million modification loss given that the moratorium would be extended beyond September for selected accounts that needed further assistance. Ahmad Zaini now says this will likely come in much lower as applications for such assistance has been lower than expected.
Asked if the worst is behind the group, Ahmad Zaini says it all depends on how long the current third wave of the coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing partial lockdowns last.
“If at all, [the stress] is going to be on the corporate property financing side. We need to see how property sales are, moving forward. If the developers have trouble selling their properties, that could be a problem for us. [The impact of] that will probably be reflected in our second quarter of next year … because banks can still continue to provide R&R (restructuring and rescheduling of loan repayments) to troubled SMEs (small and medium enterprises) and corporates, without having to categorise them as non-performing, until June next year,” he says.
As at end-June, MBSB’s gross impaired loan (GIL) ratio stood at 6.08%, while that of its banking unit MBSB Bank stood at 3.28%. “We expect GIL to improve by year-end, with our collection efforts,” Ahmad Zaini says.
CEO’s last term
According to sources, these are expected to be Ahmad Zaini’s final months as MBSB president and CEO, as he will be leaving once his current two-year contract comes to an end in February next year. He, however, declines to comment when asked about it.
Sources say that MBSB’s long-time chairman, Tan Sri Abdul Halim Ali, 77, will also be leaving upon the end of his term in February next year. Abdul Halim has been chairman since June 2001.
Ahmad Zaini, 63, has been in the lender’s driving seat for over 11 years. He was appointed to the role on Feb 26, 2009.
In early 2018, MBSB created deputy CEO roles for the purpose of succession planning. It appointed Datuk Nor Azam M Taib as deputy CEO of business and Risham Akashah Kamaruzaman as deputy CEO of operations.
It remains to be seen if one of them will eventually take on the CEO role as the EPF, the bank’s controlling shareholder, could also consider an external appointment."

Biden Wins Presidency, Ending Four Tumultuous Years Under Trump
https://www.google.com.my/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/11/07/us/politics...
By Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns
* Nov. 7, 2020 Updated 12:48 p.m. ET
Joseph R. Biden Jr. achieved victory offering a message of healing and unity. He will return to Washington facing a daunting set of crises.
Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was elected the 46th president of the United States on Saturday, promising to restore political normalcy and a spirit of national unity to confront raging health and economic crises, and making Donald J. Trump a one-term president after four years of tumult in the White House.
Mr. Biden’s victory amounted to a repudiation of Mr. Trump by millions of voters exhausted with his divisive conduct and chaotic administration, and was delivered by an unlikely alliance of women, people of color, old and young voters and a sliver of disaffected Republicans. Mr. Trump is only the third elected president since World War II to lose re-election, and the first in more than a quarter-century.
The result also provided a history-making moment for Mr. Biden’s running mate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, who will become the first woman to serve as vice president.
With his triumph, Mr. Biden, who turns 78 later this month, fulfilled his decades-long ambition in his third bid for the White House, becoming the oldest person elected president. A pillar of Washington who was first elected amid the Watergate scandal, and who prefers political consensus over combat, Mr. Biden will lead a nation and a Democratic Party that have become far more ideological since his arrival in the capital in 1973."

Markets are now increasingly worried about inflation returning as a result of historic fiscal spending and continued low interest rates, which the bank says will likely drive more investment in commodities in order to offset that risk.
""We see trends in rising social need, alongside investor complacency over inflation, as raising the political risks of policy with an inflationary bias,"" the analysts wrote. ""Accordingly, we expect an increased rotation into commodities as an inflation hedge.""
Gold is seen as one of those hedges, and has seen its price shoot up by 26% this year. Goldman expects the metal to average a price of $2,300 per ounce in 2021, up from its predicted average of $1,836 per ounce this year."

Alex Longley and Matthew Martin

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-climbs-biden-win-spurring-105416567...
(Bloomberg) -- Oil in London jumped by the most since June as Pfizer Inc. reported a potential Covid-19 vaccine breakthrough.
Crude futures spiked following news the vaccine, being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech SE, prevented more than 90% of infections in a study of tens of thousands of volunteers.
Markets globally surged. WTI climbed more than 10% in New York, while global equities soared. It led to broader strength in the oil futures curve, with timespreads also moving sharply higher.
A vaccine “would be the most meaningful type of mitigator to the situation,” Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz Bin Salman said prior to the Pfizer announcement at a conference on Monday. “We’re still hopeful that vaccine is found and that vaccine or vaccines spread and hopefully mobility would be regained.”
Since Covid first emerged, oil markets have been steadily recovering from the biggest crash in consumption in a generation. Transport use in Asia has rebounded strongly, but the renewed resurgence of the virus in Europe has continued to weigh on demand in the region. The emergence of a vaccine would not only help regions suffering form renewed lockdowns, but could also help spur the return of aviation demand -- the hardest hit corner of the market.
The relief in the market was seen in the profits from turning crude into transport fuels. Gasoline cracks in the U.S. reached their highest since mid-October, while those in Europe also gained. Jet fuel was also gaining relative to the value of other transport fuels in Europe, Bloomberg fair value data show.
Prices had earlier rallied as Joe Biden declared victory in the U.S. presidential election and began preparations to navigate America’s pandemic-hit economy out of crisis, with potential shifts coming on a range of policies from fiscal stimulus to Iranian sanctions. At the same time, Saudi Arabia said that OPEC+ could extend oil cuts through 2022 as the group seeks to re-balance the glutted market."

The first dividend that due in Sept was deferred this year. It was 25c in 2019. The profit for the dividend period deferred was reduced from 3.75bil to 2.99bil which equates to profit reduction of 21%. From this I calculate that the deferred September 2020 dividend should have worked out at around 20c a share. As this was deferred, I expect it will be added to the dividend to be announced in March 2021. This year 2020 the March dividend was 0.39 a share.
Assuming that for the current period the drop in Maybank’s profits is somewhat less than the disastrous 1st period reduction of 21%, I expect a reduction of around 15%. Thus, the div April 2021 should be in the order of 33 cents a share to which we add the deferred September dividend of an estimated 20 cents for what is now a full year dividend total of 53 cents. The dividend announcement is due 27th March for payment 10th April."

KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia said on Wednesday it has signed an agreement with China to cooperate on the development of a safe and efficacious vaccine, as part of efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.
Under the agreement, in force for an initial period of five years, the Southeast Asian nation will be given priority access to Covid-19 vaccines developed by China. Both will share knowledge and expertise and facilitate scientific and technological capabilities to advance vaccine development in their countries, Malaysia said in a joint ministerial statement.
Science, Technology and Innovation Minister Khairy Jamaluddin signed the agreement with his Chinese counterpart Wang Zhigang in a virtual ceremony.
Cooperation between Malaysia and China under the agreement would be supervised by a committee chaired by the foreign affairs ministers of both countries that was formed in October to address post-pandemic challenges.
""Both countries will also support the participation of their public and private sectors including universities, institutions, societies and organisations in joint collaborative projects,"" the Malaysian ministries said."

Robin Augustin - August 9, 2020 9:12 AM
PETALING JAYA: Seorang ahli ekonomi berkata, langkah kerajaan meningkatkan had hutang akan memberinya lebih banyak ruang untuk membuat pinjaman bagi program pemulihan ekonomi, tetapi percaya bahawa Putrajaya sepatutnya mengambil pendekatan lain.
Bekas dekan Institut Perbankan dan Kewangan Islam di Universiti Islam Antarabangsa (UIA) Kameel Mydin Meera percaya kerajaan sebaliknya harus mengambil pendekatan pelonggaran kuantitatif.
Pelonggaran kuantitatif (QE) membolehkan kerajaan menambah bekalan wang dalam ekonomi tanpa membuat pinjaman.
Ia melibatkan pencetakan atau penciptaan ringgit baru dengan tujuan meningkatkan perbelanjaan dalam ekonomi dan dengan itu merangsang ekonomi."

China’s holdings of US government debt have fallen to their lowest level since February 2017, following a fifth successive month of net US Treasury sales in September, according to a US government report.
China sold US$6.22 million of US Treasury securities in September, lowering its total holdings to US$1.062 billion, according to the latest monthly Treasury International Capital (TIC) report from the US Department of the Treasury.
Analysts cautioned that the reduction in China’s US Treasury holdings was not necessarily a sign it was reducing its overall US dollar-denominated securities holdings, since it could buy other assets such as stocks or corporate bonds instead.
According to data from the Japanese Ministry of Finance, China snapped up 27.7 billion yen (US$2.7 billion) worth of Japanese debt in September, resulting in 2.4 trillion yen of purchases over the first nine months in the year, up 73 per cent from the same period in 2019.
China lost its status as the largest foreign holder of US Treasury securities to Japan more than a year ago, in the midst of a bitter trade war between the two superpowers that some speculate could descend into an all-out financial war.
Ongoing discussions among Chinese academics have suggested that Beijing’s ongoing rotation of its US$3.14 trillion foreign exchange reserves could point to further shedding of as much as 20 per cent of its remaining US Treasury holdings."

Ahmad Naqib Idris/theedgemarkets.com
November 26, 2020 15:32 pm +08
https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/budget-2021-approved-dewan-raky...
KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 26): After a heated session during Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz’s wrapping-up speech on Budget 2021, the bill was approved at the policy stage.
Towards the end of the session, Dewan Rakyat Speaker Datuk Azhar Azizan Harun asked for a show of hands of those for and against the budget, and decided that there were more Members of Parliament (MPs) who agreed with the budget, although Pokok Sena MP Datuk Mahfuz Omar interjected and motioned for a tally of the votes.
However, this required 15 MPs to support the call for a tally. Only 13 stood up in support of the tally, according to the Speaker.
“There are fewer than 15 people [supporting the call for a tally]. There are more voices [in agreement with the budget]. The bill will see its second reading now,” he said.
The wrap-up by the minister was a heated one as ruling and opposition MPs furiously interjected for clarifications of certain issues, including the expansion of the Employees Provident Fund's (EPF) i-Sinar facility to include those receiving pay cuts due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Subang MP Wong Chen claimed that the EPF’s inflows amount to no more than RM20 billion per year, and therefore could not cover the total increased allocation of RM70 billion for the i-Sinar facility.
“Where is the EPF going to find the extra RM50 billion? Are they going to sell their shareholdings in listed companies on Bursa Malaysia? If this hits the headlines tomorrow, we will have a big problem,” he said.
However, Tengku Zafrul clarified that the EPF is seeing inflows of RM80 billion per year, adding that the Ministry of Finance (MoF) had looked into the matter.
“I would like to correct the facts. We conducted a detailed analysis of this for over a week. Actually, the inflows are not RM20 billion, RM30 billion or RM40 billion. It is RM80 billion per year,” responded the minister.
Following that, Wong pointed out that withdrawals by contributors, amounting to RM40 billion to RM50 billion per year, had to be taken into account as well — before his microphone was muted by the Speaker.
The session quickly devolved into a shouting match among the MPs, which resulted in intermittent muting of the MPs’ microphones by a visibly irritated Speaker.
“This is embarrassing behaviour. We are debating on the budget and this is how we are behaving? The rakyat are watching all of us here!” he said.
Other points mentioned during Tengku Zafrul's speech included a reduction in allocation for the Special Affairs Department (JASA) to make way for increases in other allocations, although he did not elaborate.
On the various proposals for a further extension of the loan moratorium, he said all who are eligible — whether they are in the B40, M40 or T20 category — will be able to request for various forms of assistance, which also include reducing or rescheduling loan repayments, from their respective banks."

Some see this as a saving grace that the country’s banking system is resilient, a critical factor that is needed for the domestic economy to bounce back.
Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) was the only lender that saw its net profit double or up 107.32% q-o-q in net profit for 3Q20. The banking group also declared an interim dividend of 13.5 sen per share during the quarter.
Other than Maybank, BIMB was the only other bank that declared a dividend of 12.6 sen per share in the quarter.
However, on a y-o-y basis, it is down 2.32% — still considered a commendable achievement.
RHB Bank Bhd (+55.3% q-o-q), Public Bank Bhd (+39.03% q-o-q) and Hong Leong Bank Bhd (+28.01% q-o-q) achieved solid double-digit growth for 3Q20 as most of them made large loan loss provisions in the preceding quarter in preparation to withstand the headwinds.
Among others, AMMB Holdings Bhd saw the biggest drop by 35.01% q-o-q in 3Q20, followed by CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (-29.82% q-o-q), Affin Bank Bhd (-27.72% q-o-q), BIMB Holdings Bhd (-11.25% q-o-q) and Alliance Bank Malaysia Bhd (-0.35% q-o-q)."

KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 4): Fitch Ratings has downgraded Malaysia's long-term foreign-currency issuer default rating (IDR) to 'BBB+' from 'A-', with a stable outlook. The downgrade marks the ratings agency's first for the country since the 1997/98 Asian Financial Crisis.
The depth and duration of the Covid-19 crisis have weakened several of Malaysia's key credit metrics, said Fitch Ratings in a statement today.
The pandemic's impact on the Malaysian economy has been substantial and has added to the country's fiscal burden, which was already high, relative to peers going into the health crisis, Fitch said."

Ringgit to strengthen to 3.80-3.90 against US dollar in 2021 — Rakuten Trade

KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 7): Rakuten Trade Research foresees the ringgit (MYR) to strengthen to the range of 3.80 to 3.90 against the US dollar (USD) in 2021 as it expects Chinese yuan (renminbi or RMB) sentiment to improve against the greenback's.
The research house’s head of research Kenny Yee said in a briefing he envisages the new US administration to be less volatile next year, hence expecting regional currencies to strengthen against the US dollar.
“We expect China to lead Asia as the new US administration is seen as a better business partner than Trump’s.
“As the MYR/USD movement is the closest with RMB/USD, we foresee the MYR to strengthen against the USD to possibly the 3.80/90 levels in 2021,” he said."

(PUBLISHED FRI, DEC 18 20207:38 PM ESTUPDATED FRI, DEC 18 20207:59 PM EST)
~ Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine is the second approved for use in the U.S.
~ It will bolster the number of available doses, which states desperately need to fend off the pandemic.
~ The U.S. plans to distribute roughly 5.9 million doses of Moderna’s vaccine to 64 states, territories and major cities across the nation next week.
The Food and Drug Administration has approved Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine for emergency use. The vaccine — the second approved for use in the U.S. behind Pfizer and BioNTech’s — bolsters the U.S. supply of doses. The potentially lifesaving shots are desperately needed to fend off the pandemic that has taken more than 300,000 American lives and overwhelmed hospitals.
The FDA’s emergency use authorization Friday approves the federal government’s plan to distribute roughly 5.9 million doses of Moderna’s vaccine to 64 states, territories and major cities across the nation next week.
“We likely will see shots in the arm by the very early part of next week, I would hope Monday or Tuesday,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on the “Today” show on Friday morning.
In addition to Moderna’s vaccine, the U.S. also plans to send out 2 million doses of Pfizer’s vaccine after 2.9 million doses were cleared for shipment this week, Gen. Gustave Perna, who oversees logistics for the Operation Warp Speed vaccine project, said Monday. Both vaccines require two doses three to four weeks apart. Moderna’s Covid vaccine is its first-ever FDA authorized product.
“With the availability of two vaccines now for the prevention of COVID-19, the FDA has taken another crucial step in the fight against this global pandemic that is causing vast numbers of hospitalizations and deaths in the United States each day,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said in a statement.
U.S. officials hope to vaccinate at least 20 million Americans — mostly front-line health-care workers and nursing home residents — by the end of the year. Initial doses will be limited as manufacturing ramps up, with officials predicting it will take months to immunize everyone in the U.S. who wants to be vaccinated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has provided states with an outline that recommends prioritizing health workers and nursing homes, but states can distribute the vaccine as they see fit.
Already, states are reporting confusion about vaccine plans. In recent days, state officials said they learned their second shipment of Pfizer’s vaccine would be smaller than expected or delayed. In Florida, for example, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said the federal government told him the state would receive 205,000 Pfizer vaccine doses next week and 247,000 the following week. Those shipments are now on hold, DeSantis said at a press conference Tuesday, and it’s unclear when they will arrive.
Moderna’s vaccine, like Pfizer’s, uses messenger RNA, or mRNA, technology. It’s a new approach to vaccines that uses genetic material to provoke an immune response. Late-stage clinical trial data published last month shows Moderna’s vaccine is more than 94% effective in preventing Covid, is safe and appears to fend off severe disease. To achieve maximum effectiveness, the vaccine requires two doses taken four weeks apart.
The FDA has indicated it would authorize a Covid-19 vaccine that’s safe and at least 50% effective. The flu vaccine, by comparison, generally reduces people’s risk of getting influenza by 40% to 60% compared with people who aren’t inoculated, according to the CDC.

China's holdings of Treasuries fell to $1.054 trillion, the lowest since January 2017, cutting its load of U.S. government debt for five straight months.
Japan, the world's largest holder of Treasuries at $1.269 trillion, also pared back its holdings for a third straight month.
The decline in Japan's and China's stockpile of Treasuries was offset by a surge in holdings from Belgium and the UK, two countries used as financial centers for some of the biggest sovereign debt holders."

i received the plan for DRP, please give me advise whether worth to take the reinvestment price
It depends on the number of shares you have and how long you want to hold MBB.
The DRP is 85sen cheaper than market price. If you want to keep MBB for years, then take it up. If not take round figure, ie 100 shares and so on to avoid odd lots.

Therefore, I am listing some links that give you a fair idea of Derivatives. In Malaysia, we have what is called ""Structured Warrants"". If you google Structured Warrants, the only links you come up with are Malaysian and Singaporean.
This instrument does not exist anywhere else in the world. Why then, is it called ""European Styled Cash Settled"" ?
These instruments are actually ""Contract For Difference"" or CFD. Which basically means a ""BET"". More precisely, a Bet ON a Bet.
Typically when we buy the share of a company,we are assuming, with some understanding of the business and its prospects its value at a future date. That could be termed a calculated bet.
However, when you buy a CFD, you are Betting against the Bet someone (An Investment Bank) has taken on the value of a share at a future date. Typical to Malaysia, that Investment Bank (IB) is not required to tell you what he does to market make the share so that he does not lose.
In what sense of the word is this called Investing ?
There is NOT EVEN ONE Structured Warrant issued so far, where the Settlement value is more than the Break-even price for
the issuer.

KUALA LUMPUR: Bank Negara Malaysia’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) kept the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) unchanged at 1.75% during its meeting on Wednesday.
It said in a statement for Malaysia, the resurgence in Covid-19 cases and the introduction of targeted containment measures had affected the recovery momentum in the fourth quarter of 2020.
“As a result, growth for 2020 is expected to be near the lower end of the earlier forecasted range.
“For 2021, while near-term growth will be affected by the re-introduction of stricter containment measures, the impact will be less severe than that experienced in 2020, ” it said.
However, Bank Negara said the growth trajectory was projected to improve from the second quarter onwards."

The villagers were very happy, after all there were hundreds of Monkeys in a nearby forest.
They caught the Monkeys and got them to the rich man. He bought hundreds of Monkeys and paid 100 for every Monkey the villagers gave him.
They began to make a living out of getting Monkeys from the forest and selling it to the rich man.
Soon, the forest began to run out of monkeys that were easy to catch.
Sensing this, the rich man offers 200 for every monkey. The villagers were ecstatic.
They went back to the forest, set up traps and caught the monkeys and got them to the rich man.
A few days later, the rich man announced he would pay 300 per monkey.
The villagers began climbing trees and risking their lives to catch monkeys and get them to the rich man – who bought them all.
There were no Monkeys left in the forest!
One day, the rich man announced he would like to buy more monkeys – this time for 800 each.
The villagers couldn’t believe this. They were desperately trying to get more monkeys.
Meanwhile, the rich man said he had to go back to the city on some business work and until he returns his manager would deal on his behalf.
Once he left, the villagers were unhappy. They were making quick and easy money from selling monkeys, but the forest no longer had monkeys.
This is when the manager of the rich man stepped in.
He made an offer the villagers could not refuse.
Pointing out to all the monkeys that the rich man had caged. He told the villagers he would sell the monkeys for 400 each.
“Sell them back to the rich man at 800 each when he comes back” the manager said.
The villagers were over the moon. Buy for 400 and sell for 800 in few days. They had just found the easiest way to double their money.
The villagers collected all their savings and even borrowed money.
There were long queues and within a few hours, almost all the monkeys were sold out.
Unfortunately, their happiness did not last long, as the manager went missing the next day and the rich man never came back.
Many villagers kept the monkeys with them, hoping the rich man would come back. But soon, they lost hope and had to let the monkeys back into the forest as feeding and taking care of the noisy monkeys became extremely difficult.
Good Luck!"

Monday, 25 Jan 2021 05:44 PM MYT
BY EMMANUEL SANTA MARIA CHIN
https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2021/01/25/dr-noor-hisham-sees...
KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 25 — Malaysia added another 3,048 more Covid-19 infections on the eve of the original expiry
of the renewed movement control order, prompting Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah to say the country’s situation could stabilise soon.
The Health director-general said the basic reproduction number (R0) of Covid-19 infections was already showing signs of decline,
adding that it should soon be as low as 1.06.
Today’s new cases were the lowest across the last 10 days in which the country also saw its highest ever new daily cases."

Health director-general Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said the government is not keen to implement the MCO for a long period due to the livelihoods it could affect.
“We do not want to prolong the MCO.
“If we implement the MCO for four weeks until early February, and then followed by a conditional MCO for three months, we hope we can reduce the number of Covid-19 cases to double figures,” said Dr Noor Hisham at a virtual press conference on Monday (Jan 25).
He said the current R0 (infectivity rate, pronounced R-naught) has gone down from 1.2 to 1.06, indicating that Covid-19 cases may be getting less.
“Today the number of cases is 3,048, which is less than yesterday (3,346 cases on Sunday).
“We hope the cases can stabilise at 3,000. Right now, the R0 has gone down from 1.2 to 1.06. But this is not enough.
“Tomorrow, it could be less than 1.06. Better if it is less than 1.
“So we are hoping in the first two weeks of the MCO, the number of cases is stable, and no increases.
“And then, after Jan 27, we expect to see the number of cases go down, ” said Dr Noor Hisham.
He said a prolonged MCO will be detrimental to the economy.
“If we prolong the MCO, our economy could be affected. We need to balance health and economy, as well as life and livelihood,” he added.
The MCO was first imposed from Jan 13 in several states and the Federal Territories for a period of two weeks, and was initially supposed to end on Jan 26. It was then extended to all states and the Federal Territories, except Sarawak, and will last until Feb 4."

1. Dow Jones future 和 KLSE in bearish trend!
2. 科技龙头的漂亮财无法推高股价，比如apple财报公布后跌最多，收入盈利都创新高，可是股价却向南跌，跌跌不休。
3. Malaysia COVID-19 疫情每况愈下，屡创新高，不久的将来、COVID-19 就在你左右，当你的家人因COVID-19往生，政府还不承认错误，加强MCO，赢了股票，坐满一车车的金银珠宝，输掉自己的家人，你还会开心吗？要知道亡者没得净身，没得穿上喜爱华丽的服装，要以最快的速度将遗体入棺，直接封棺，之后就直接送去火化或下葬，连送最后一程，也只能两三个亲人，因为处于高风险，是不允许太多人送最后一程。况且每个家庭成员都必须去检验，有些还在隔离着。我相信这些种种凄凉和悲哀的过程，我们都不想遇到这样的死亡吧！所以在此提醒大家，COVID-19 真的不是开玩笑的，不要以为不会发生在自己的身上，为了自己、家人、亲友们的安全和健康，没必要真的少出门，千万要记得带好口罩、勤洗手、保持社交距离真的很重要，别再赌股票，赌运气，收割下雨财为上，阿弥陀佛，我们离股灾已不远了。"

Join Our Community
Oil prices could go as high as $100 a barrel next year on the back of “very easy monetary policy” and reflation trade, Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at Energy Aspects, told Bloomberg in an interview.
“It’s a futures market, we always discount stuff that’s going to happen in the future, now. That’s why prices are rallying right now,” the analyst said on the Bloomberg Surveillance program.
“We’ve always called for $80 plus oil in 2022. Maybe that is $100 now given how much liquidity there is in the system. I wouldn’t rule that out,” Sen noted.
On Monday, Brent Crude prices hit $60 a barrel, rising above that threshold for the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic early last year."

AstraZeneca/Oxford-developed vaccines to reach countries in the coming weeks
(15 February 2021 News release Geneva, Switzerland Reading time: 2 min)
The World Health Organization (WHO) today listed two versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, giving the green light for these vaccines to be rolled out globally through COVAX. The vaccines are produced by AstraZeneca-SKBio (Republic of Korea) and the Serum Institute of India.
WHO’s Emergency Use Listing (EUL) assesses the quality, safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and is a prerequisite for COVAX Facility vaccine supply. It also allows countries to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer COVID-19 vaccines.
“Countries with no access to vaccines to date will finally be able to start vaccinating their health workers and populations at risk, contributing to the COVAX Facility’s goal of equitable vaccine distribution,” said Dr Mariângela Simão, WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Medicines and Health Products.
‘But we must keep up the pressure to meet the needs of priority populations everywhere and facilitate global access. To do that, we need two things – a scale-up of manufacturing capacity, and developers’ early submission of their vaccines for WHO review.”
The WHO EUL process can be carried out quickly when vaccine developers submit the full data required by WHO in a timely manner. Once those data are submitted, WHO can rapidly assemble its evaluation team and regulators from around the world to assess the information and, when necessary, carry out inspections of manufacturing sites.
In the case of the two AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccines, WHO assessed the quality, safety and efficacy data, risk management plans and programmatic suitability, such as cold chain requirements. The process took under four weeks.
The vaccine was reviewed on 8 February by WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE), which makes recommendations for vaccines’ use in populations (i.e. recommended age groups, intervals between shots, advice for specific groups such as pregnant and lactating women). The SAGE recommended the vaccine for all age groups 18 and above.
The AstraZeneca/Oxford product is a viral vectored vaccine called ChAdOx1-S [recombinant]. It is being produced at several manufacturing sites, as well as in the Republic of Korea and India.

(February 16, 2021 09:51 am +08)
KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 16): Malaysia will get its first batch of Covid-19 vaccines produced by US and German drugmakers Pfizer and BioNTech on Feb 21, and kick off its inoculation drive five days after that, Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said on Tuesday.
Muhyiddin said he will be the first to receive a dose of the vaccine when the campaign starts on Feb 26.
""This comprehensive programme is aimed at ensuring herd immunity in the community so that we can stop the spread of Covid-19 infections and bring an end to the pandemic,"" Muhyiddin said at the launch of the vaccination programme handbook.

Malaysia has seen a sharp spike in coronavirus infections in recent weeks, after having largely reined in the epidemic for most of 2020. It has reported a total of over 260,000 Covid-19 cases, the third highest in Southeast Asia after Indonesia and the Philippines, and 975 deaths.
The Southeast Asian country has said it aims to cover at least 80% of its 32 million population within a year and has secured more than enough vaccines to reach the target.
Apart from its deal with Pfizer and BioNTech, Malaysia also has supply agreements with Britain's AstraZeneca, Russia's Gamaleya Research Institute, and China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd and CanSino Biologics.
Muhyiddin said earlier this month that the first phase of the vaccine rollout from February to April will involve 500,000 frontline workers, followed by 9.4 million high-risk individuals who will be vaccinated between April and August.
A third and final phase will involve more than 16 million adults aged 18 and older, and will run from May to February next year.
The government has said it will extend its free Covid-19 vaccination programme to all foreigners residing in the country, but that priority will be given to Malaysians.

CAHYA Mata Sarawak Bhd’s (CMS) earnings forecast for the financial year 2021 (FY21) and FY22 has been revised upwards on expectations of higher income from its associates OM Materials (Sarawak) Sdn Bhd and Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd.
RHB Investment Bank Bhd (RHB Research) raised the conglomerate’s earnings forecast for the next two years by 9% and maintained a ‘Buy’ call on CMS with a higher target price (TP) of RM2.90 from RM2.40.
“Earnings prospects for CMS’ associates OM Materials and Kenanga Investment are turning more upbeat on the ferroalloy selling price rebounds and buoyant equity trading turnover year-to-date.
“This prompts us to raise our FY21-FY22 forecast earnings by 9% to between RM217 million and RM233 million, suggesting an upside risk to the current FY21 consensus forecast of RM170 million,” its analyst Lester Siew said in a note yesterday."

(February 21, 2021 10:24 am +08)
SEPANG (Feb 21): The long-awaited Covid-19 vaccine to protect Malaysia’s population arrived in the country on a special aircraft which landed at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) here today.
Flight MH604, bearing the Jalur Gemilang livery to symbolise the vaccine is for Malaysians, landed at 10.07am with the first batch of 312,390 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
The Passenger-to-Cargo (P2C) flight used an Airbus 330-300, operated by MAB Kargo Sdn Bhd (MASkargo), the cargo arm of national carrier Malaysia Airlines Bhd.
Upon landing, the process of transferring the vaccine, which was placed in the unit load device (ULD), from the cargo section of the aircraft to a truck belonging to logistics company DHL was carried out at the Advanced Cargo Centre (ACC) of KLIA.
Among those present to witness the historic moment were Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Adham Baba, Coordinating Minister for National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme Khairy Jamaluddin and Transport Minister Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong.
After the transfer process was completed, the truck was then escorted by police to a designated vaccine storage location as a safety measure.
The vaccine’s journey from the Pfizer plant in Belgium was handled by pharmaceutical company Pfizer and DHL, a leader in the logistics industry, under a joint partnership for the international transportation of the vaccine.
The vaccine left Puurs in Belgium and was in transit at the Leipzig Halle Airport in Germany, before continuing on its journey to Singapore for distribution to Asia-Pacific countries, including Malaysia.
The Health Ministry (MoH), on behalf of the Malaysian government, had entered into an agreement with Pfizer (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd on Jan 11 this year for the purchase of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
The arrival of the vaccine will kick-start the National Covid-19 Immunisation Programme, the largest vaccination programme ever in the country.
As one of the earliest countries in Southeast Asia to use the vaccine, Malaysia, with a population of 32 million people, is hopeful that the immunisation programme will expedite the country’s efforts to revive its economy and improve the lives of the people.
The vaccine has been certified effective and approved by the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) of the MoH.
The immunisation programme is divided into three phases, with the first scheduled from Feb 26 to April for frontline personnel including from the MoH, Malaysian Armed Forces, Royal Malaysia Police, Civil Defence Force and Malaysian Volunteer Department (Rela).
The MoH has identified and prepared about 600 vaccination stations nationwide, among them health clinics, as well as government and private hospitals. Each station is to have seven vaccinators.
The second phase is scheduled from April to August for senior citizens aged 60 and above and vulnerable groups with morbidity issues, as well as persons with disabilities.
The third phase is to be from May to February 2022 for those aged 18 and above.
Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin is expected to receive the vaccine on the first day of the immunisation exercise on Feb 26, along with several of the frontliners.
The agreement with Pfizer (Malaysia) involves the procurement of 12,799,800 doses of vaccine, covering 20% of the population, with two doses per person.
The vaccination programme, themed 'Protect Oneself, Protect Everyone', is a government strategy to ensure that as many Malaysians as possible are vaccinated to break the chain of infection.

（吉隆坡28日讯）首相丹斯里慕尤丁透露，他会在3月中宣布一个全面性的经济复苏计划。
他说，政府不仅要考虑宏观的经济问题，也要进行微观的管理，包括如何吸引投资，提升出口，确保各个领域的经济发展。
慕尤丁配合国盟执政一周年接受媒体联访时，这么指出。星洲日报是唯一参与联访的中文媒体。
他透露，他已指示各部门优先处理与人民，经济和商业有关的事务，包括废除没有必要的官僚程序，以加速各项计划运行的效率。
“不只是联邦政府，州政府也需要给予配合，因为人民的问题必须立即解决；对于人民而言，每等待一天都是煎熬。”
慕尤丁表示，仍有很多外资有兴趣来马进行投资。
“大马去年首9个月核准1098亿令吉总投资，总共涉及2935项投资，料创造6万4701个就业机会；不仅如此，我国在未来两年也会有许多投资激励措施，这些都将能吸引外资。”
“因此，我对于外资（吸引到）并不担心，我们有亲商的政策，商业领域会持续成长。”

（吉隆坡3日讯）随著我国新冠肺炎确诊病例见顶回落、疫苗接种计划开跑、近期经济数据表现乐观，加上政府逐渐放宽限制及提供针对性援助，经济学家普遍认为，国行周四（4日）降息的可能性已经减低。
《彭博社》经济学家亨得森指出，1月的货币政策会议之后，情况正逐步好转，疫情缓和之馀，疫苗接种计划也已经展开，政府正逐步开放封锁措施。此外，油价走高，外围情况逐渐明朗，包括大马主要贸易伙伴中国的经济回稳，各国也积极展开疫苗接种。
这种种的有利因素显示，今年首季经济疲弱的走势将会是短暂的，因此国行在周四的货币政策会议后，相信会继续按兵不动。
汇丰银行（HSBC）经济学家佐瑟英卡尔卡德拉也改变之前认为国行将在3月的会议中会降息的看法。他表示，大马最近一波疫情导致政府再度实施行管令（MCO），而我国也因此成为亚洲区域中居民流动性最低的国家。
佐瑟预计，我国私人消费将大幅收窄，因此将大马今年国内生产总值（GDP）预测从早前的6.7%，下调至5.2%。
虽然该银行的最新预测低于政府预测的6.5%至7.5%成长，但佐瑟预期，政府可能在近期内调整经济成长预测。值得一提的是，国家银行将在本月底发布其2020年年报，这通常是政府调整官方预测的时间点之一。
“考虑到目前行管令导致大马经济每日损失3亿令吉，低于去年首轮的每日损失24亿令吉，政府的经济成长预测下修幅度或不会太显著。”
商品涨势支撑经济
此外，政府也一再强调，由于电子产品出口和工业生产持续回升，我国制造业氛围乐观。而半导体领域的产能也逐渐增加，在全球汽车晶片市场占有更显著的份额。
另外，天然气和棕油等大宗商品价格近期上涨有助支撑经济成长，我国1月贷款增长也从12月的3.4%，走高至3.8%，显示银行体系稳健。
佐瑟强调，石油和天然气价格走高，增强我国的财政状况，让政府在推出援助政策方面有更多的灵活性，而政府也重新分配2021年的支出，以针对最新一轮的封锁，为受冲击的领域提供援助。
“原油价格预测料上调至每桶45美元至55美元之间，再加上近几个月的企业税收高于预期，让政府可略微上调支出。”
汇丰银行早前预测，国行会在3月4日的货币政策会议上将隔夜政策利率（OPR）下调25个基点。但考虑到近期肺炎确诊病例逐渐减少、政府逐步放宽限制措施、疫苗接种计划比预期中早开始、近期经济数据表现乐观，加上政府所提供的针对性援助措施，佐瑟认为国行降息的可能性已减低。
隔夜政策利率今年料企稳1.75%
佐瑟预测今年的隔夜政策利率将维持在1.75%。
他也强调，虽然封锁措施对经济成长造成冲击，但国行周四下调利率的机会不大。
“但若情况比预期更坏，国行会是区域中为数不多，仍有余力进一步提供货币政策救援的央行之一。”
国行在去年曾4度降息，将隔夜政策利率下调至1.75%，为2004年以来的最低水平。
而国行总裁拿督诺珊希雅在2月公布去年末季GDP数据时指出，国行在去年降息125个基点，足以扶持经济成长，货币政策委员会也认为将利率维持在1.75%，是相对适当且宽松的水平。"

(March 7, 2021, 1:24 AM GMT+8 Corrected March 7, 2021, 11:41 AM GMT+8)
President Joe Biden’s signature $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill passed the Senate 50-49 on Saturday following a more than 25-hour marathon of amendment votes completed after Democrats settled an intra-party dispute over unemployment aid.
The measure, the American Rescue Plan Act, now heads back to the House, where Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said a vote will be held Tuesday. Although some House progressives have complained about changes made by the Senate, none so far have threatened to withhold votes. Democrats aim to have it signed into law next week.
Enactment of the second-largest stimulus bill in U.S. history would hand Biden his first legislative victory and set the stage for work this spring on a massive infrastructure and manufacturing recovery bill that he wants.
“As tough as this moment is, there are brighter days ahead -- there really are,” Biden said at the White House after the Senate acted. “It’s never been a good bet to bet against America.”
The bill would provide the biggest health-care expansion since the Affordable Care Act, a temporary plan to slash the child poverty rate and send $1,400 payments soon to millions of Americans. In addition, state and local governments are set to get more than $350 billion in aid and schools would get an infusion of funding, all of which Democrats hope will propel a faster economic recovery long before they face voters in 2022.
It would deliver $300 a week in extra unemployment assistance through Sept. 6 and make the first $10,200 of unemployment insurance benefits non-taxable for households with incomes of less than $150,000. The legislation includes $160 billion for vaccine and testing programs to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. The Senate also adopted a bipartisan amendment from Republican Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia to direct $800 million toward alleviating youth homelessness.
Overall, the legislation is double the size of the Obama-era stimulus and exceeded many earlier Wall Street estimates for how big a package could Democrats pass with the thinest margin of control. It is eclipsed in size only by the $2.2 trillion pandemic aid plan passed a year ago.
The Democratic drive in the Senate stalled out for nearly 12 hours on Friday after Manchin -- a pivotal vote in the 50-50 Senate -- balked at an amendment to extend supplemental unemployment benefits into October.
As Republicans tried to lure Manchin to vote for a proposal by Senator Rob Portman of Ohio that would extend the benefits only through July 18, Democrats from Biden on down furiously lobbied Manchin and reworked their earlier plan to get his support.
Negotiations on that amendment caused a separate vote on minimum wage that set a record for the longest vote in Senate history, dragging on for nearly 12 hours as Democrats tried to keep their caucus united. In the end, the provision was left out of the legislation because of arcane Senate budget rules.
Despite that stumble, passage was a major victory for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who aimed to show that Democrats could wield power despite the 50-50 Senate split.
The deals he brokered on stimulus payments and unemployment aid, as well as the addition of a dozen smaller changes, ensured that moderate Democrats like Manchin and Arizona’s Kyrsten Sinema were on board along with progressives like Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden. That may also help in the House, where progressives were already angered over the loss of the minimum wage provision.
Democrats held together to reject Republican amendments on limiting state and local aid; restricting abortion funding; banning aid to schools that have transgender athletes or fail to open 5 days a week; and ending aid to minority farmers, among others
Schumer said the vote showed Republicans that if they don’t negotiate, Democrats are prepared to act on their own.

(March 7, 2021, 2:00 AM GMT+8 Updated on March 7, 2021, 3:41 AM GMT+8)
~ Growth estimates have jumped in light of recent developments
~ Gains may give some pause on massive infrastructure package
With Democrats on the verge of passing an almost $2 trillion stimulus bill and Covid-19 vaccinations moving ahead, the U.S. economic outlook is much sunnier than it looked in early January.
The latest Bloomberg monthly survey of economists shows the annualized pace of growth in the first quarter will be 4.8%, twice as fast as respondents expected just two months ago. For the full year, gross domestic product is projected to rise 5.5%, which would be the fastest since 1984 and is up from January’s estimate of 4.1%.
After January’s key run-off elections in Georgia, where Democrats secured two Senate seats to win slim control of the chamber from Republicans, economists were generally penciling in a pandemic relief package worth around $1 trillion. Democrats stuck together to push through a bill almost double that size; no Republican senators voted for the plan on Saturday. The measure next goes back to the House for a final vote, expected to be Tuesday.
President Joe Biden, speaking Saturday after the Senate vote, looked for a major boost to the economy.
“This will create millions of new jobs,” Biden told reporters at the White House. “It’s estimated over 6 million new jobs by itself; increase the gross domestic product by a trillion dollars.”
“As tough as this moment is, there are brighter days ahead -- there really are,” Biden said. “It’s never been a good bet to bet against America.”
An additional round of $1,400 stimulus checks for millions of Americans, combined with supplemental jobless benefits and the acceleration in vaccinations, should help sustain growth throughout the year, said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC.

Why sell say at 8.50 which after 0.385 dividend is only about 8.10 which is fairly low.In an economic recovery and with Covid vaccinations in place even after the ex-date the price should be able to recover well above 8.10. You can use the dividend to buy more shares at the ""corrected"" low price. With more shares you will get more dividends in subsequent dividend payments. This is the famous compounding advocated by Warren Buffett. Remember, a good dividend is a sure thing against earnings growth which is less known.The DRP ie dividend reinvestment plan of mbb ensures mbb can keep on with its generous dividend payments. EPF is a big holder of mbb shares evidently happy with its generous dividend payments."

So they punt. The big funds also takes the oppurtunity to buy and sell among themselves thus making it more exciting for all. And it is also the best intrest for funds to increase the price when sentiments allows it do do so. Anyway, a 2-3 % dividend yield via blue chips with potential capital growth organically makes good investment sense. u do not have to have a 3 digit iq to comprehend these.

(March 11, 2021, 7:47 PM GMT+8)
Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE’s coronavirus vaccine blocked 94% of asymptomatic infections in an Israeli study that further builds the case for the shot’s overwhelming effectiveness against the virus a year after the pandemic began.
The vaccine stopped 97% of symptomatic cases, hospitalizations and deaths, the companies and the Israeli Ministry of Health said on Thursday. Crucially, the results were measured two weeks after the second dose, suggesting that high efficacy seen after the first dose of the shot may be even better once vaccination is complete.
“This clearly demonstrates the power of the Covid-19 vaccine to fight this virus,” Yeheskel Levy, director of the health ministry, said in a statement. “We aim to achieve even higher uptake in people of all ages, which gives us hope of regaining normal economic and social function in the not-so-distant future.”

This is my valuation for maybank
2009 = i take the price & valuation on 16/3/2009, represent the worst valuation ratio of maybank can go within US Subprime mortgage crisis.
2018 = i take the price & valuation on 24/10/2018,represent the highest valuation ratio of maybank can go after US Subprime mortgage crisis.
2021 = the current valuation.
2009 2018 2021
NTA 4.44 6.76 7.51
DIV 0.2 0.55 0.52
price 3.6 10.8 8.55
P/B 0.81 1.60 1.14
D/Y 5.6% 5.1% 6.1%
Non-Performing Loans 3.60% 2.11% 2.02%
Net Interest Margin 2.50% 2.36% 2.15%
CET 1 8.13% 14.19% 14.73%
Loan Growth 16.40% 4.0% 4.0%
OPR Rate 2% 3.25% 1.75%
if you compare the History P/B 0.81~1.60, we are on 1.14 now, which is still below 50% of history P/B (the median P/B is 1.20）,the share price now is still consider safe.
although the Net interest margin is getting lower, but the CET 1 and Non-Performing Loans ratio is getting really good.
from the fundamental side, Maybank deserve little bit higher P/B just because better capital adequacy & dividend yield.(although the current mainstream valuation style is future earning)
And i expecting maybank can get higher P/B when finance news headline start showing ""Economy reopen"" > ""Inflation"" > ""market expect centre bank move up interest rate""
1) when we all get vaccinated, banking stock outlook is become better when economy reopen
2) then the market is expecting big inflation will going to happen after we get vaccinated. inflation is good news for bank.
3) The US 10 year treasury yield is keep going up and now stand above 1.5%. （now US banking stock share price is already keep going up)
this 2,3 event will make market start to “expect"" and guessing when the FED will going move up the interest rate, (when the FED move up rate , all the remain countries include malaysia will follow to move up interest rate),
move up interest rate = banking stock get better profit
move down interest rate = banking stock missing profit
market ""expect"" center bank move up interest rate = banking stock price goes up.
but i don't need FED really move up interest rate , i just need ""market expectation"" to push up the banking stock outlook for me.
even i miss all my anticipation , and this is just my imagination :D,
consider i entry the stock when P/B 1.14 & DY 6%，i have nothing to lose if nothing happen. （actually my average cost is around RM7.50)
sorry for my bad english, and this is my first time to invest banking stock, my plan might be totally wrong for how to invest in banking stock, please correct me if i am wrong."

ANd i went 90 % all in with the cash, anD IT DID GO LOWER BY 30 SEN PER SHARE, I toook in MBB & PBB as safe bets that i dont have to monitor always.. just let it go on auto mode and just pocket the divvy, It turns the goreng stocks were ( as of today) lost much valur ( although they were invested by epf). so what u did there is appriaciated and u honestly did ur due deligence,,,but sisncei am lazy, i just use logic.

(PUBLISHED THU, MAR 11 20216:30 PM ESTUPDATED THU, MAR 11 20216:51 PM EST)
~ President Joe Biden is set to announce that he will direct states to make all adults eligible for the Covid vaccines by May 1.
~ Biden in his first primetime address to the nation is also expected to say that Americans should be able to gather in small groups to celebrate the Fourth of July.
~ The speech comes hours after Biden signed into law the $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill, which he had strongly pushed during his first 50 days in office.
WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden is set to announce Thursday evening that he will direct states to make all adults eligible for the Covid vaccines by May 1.
Biden, in his first primetime address to the nation, is also expected to say that Americans should be able to gather in small groups to celebrate the Fourth of July, a senior administration official told reporters Thursday.
“He will be clear that that does not mean large events where lots of people gather, but it does mean that we can once again have an independence day with small gatherings and celebrations,” the official told reporters ahead of the speech.
“And that’s a big step in the right direction,” the official added. “We believe that if we do our part we’ll be in a much better place by Independence Day, and we can start to resume more of our normal activities.”
Biden’s address is scheduled for just after 8 p.m. ET, and will be broadcast from the East Room of the White House. The speech is expected to last less than 20 minutes.
The primetime event comes hours after Biden signed into law the $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill, which he had aggressively pushed Congress to pass during his first 50 days in office.
Biden’s remarks come as the United States administered a record number of vaccines over the weekend. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention administered 2.9 million vaccines on Saturday, a record, and 2.4 million on Sunday, according to the agency’s latest tally. The numbers are subject to revisions as more data becomes available to public health officials.

(PUBLISHED FRI, MAR 12 20215:26 PM EST)
~ The bond market is once more the wild card for the stock market. It could rein in any gains in tech or growth stocks if yields continue to rise in the week ahead.
~ The Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday. While it’s not expected to take any action, it could be a catalyst for a move in yields.
~ Value and cyclicals could continue to lead the market, as investors bet the vaccine rollout and fiscal stimulus will help the economy’s reopening.
Bonds could be volatile in the week ahead. If yields go higher, that could make it difficult for big tech and other growth stocks to gain traction.
Rising bond yields have been challenging growth stocks. Names like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon have been lagging as investors move to cyclical groups that do well in an economic recovery. Even so, the S&P 500 and the Dow both closed at record highs Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite was lower.
The Nasdaq, home to big tech, did gain 3% in the past week, but it is down 5.5% over the last month.
The bond market in the coming week will likely take its cues from the Federal Reserve, which meets Tuesday and Wednesday.
The central bank is expected to give a nod to much better growth. Bond pros are also watching to see whether Fed officials will tweak their interest rate outlook, which now does not include any rate hikes through 2023.
Fed ahead
“The markets have way too high expectations around what the Fed is going to do or say,” said Gregory Peters, head of multi-sector and strategy at PGIM Fixed Income. “I think the message is going to be consistent.”
He said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to sound dovish and is unlikely to give any time frames on when the central bank will change its bond-buying program or other policy.
Bond yields, which move opposite price, have been rising on an improving outlook for the economy.
That trade also showed up in the stock market, with the Dow up 4% for the week to end Friday at a record 32,778. Consumer discretionary stocks, which include retail, were among the best performers, up 5.7%, boosted by optimism that individuals will spend their $1,400 stimulus checks.
Yields were higher Friday after President Joe Biden said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine by May 1. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a high of 1.642% — its highest level in more than a year.
It is the key rate to watch since it affects mortgages and other consumer and business loans.
“The economy is going to be unbelievably strong this year — deficit spending, reopening, vaccines,” said Peters of PGIM.
“It looks like for next year, all the numbers are being revised higher,” he said. “So this thing could have some sustainable growth, so I think there’s going to be pressure on rates moving higher.”
Bond yields rose sharply over the past month. The rapid pace of the move has made stocks jittery as investors adjust to higher rates. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% on Feb. 12.
Growth vs. cyclicals
Over the last month, energy stocks have risen nearly 20%, financial stocks are up 10.2%, and industrials are up 7%. The S&P technology sector is down 5.4% over the last month, and communications services, which includes internet names was up 0.8%.
Higher rates are a challenge for tech and other growth stocks because those shares are expensive and have high price-earnings ratios.
“When rates are very low, valuations don’t matter to people,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Global Advisors.
“If rates are low, there’s no penalty,” he said. “If rates start to go up, people become much more sensitive to valuations, and that’s what we’ve seen here.”
Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com, follows short-term stock market technicals and trades many of the growth stocks. Lately, however, he’s found himself sitting in many value names and cyclicals.

(PUBLISHED SUN, MAR 14 20216:02 PM EDTUPDATED SUN, MAR 14 20217:42 PM EDT)
U.S. stock futures moved higher in overnight trading and pointed to gains at the open on Monday, continuing last week’s rally that led the Dow and S&P 500 to record highs.
Dow futures rose 120 points. S&P 500 futures gained 0.25% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.2%.
Stocks rose last week with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 4% and the S&P 500 gaining 2.6%. The S&P 500 and the Dow both closed at record highs Friday.
The Nasdaq Composite advanced 3% last week, despite a sell-off on Friday spurred by rising interest rates. The jump in bond yields has challenged growth stocks in recent weeks and sent investors into cyclical pockets of the market. The Nasdaq is up less than 1% this month, while the Dow and S&P are up 6% and 3.5%, respectively.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury hit its highest level in more than a year on Friday. The benchmark Treasury note reached 1.642%, its highest level since February 2020.
The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 surged more than 7% last week as investors rotated into smaller stocks that benefit from a sharp economic comeback.
Last week, investors cheered the $1.9 trillion stimulus package that President Joe Biden signed into law. The IRS started processing $1,400 direct payments on Friday and checks started hitting bank accounts over the weekend. The bill will also put nearly $20 billion into Covid-19 vaccinations and $350 billion into state, local and tribal government relief.
Investors will be gearing up for Tuesday and Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting where the Federal Reserve will deliver its decision on interest rates. The bond market in the coming week will likely take its cues from the Federal Reserve.
The central bank is expected to acknowledge much better growth in the economy. Bond pros are also watching to see whether Fed officials will tweak their interest rate outlook, which now does not include any rate hikes through 2023.
Goldman Sachs chief economist David Kostin told clients on Sunday that he expects interest rates to continue to rise in the coming months and investors will have to “continually grapple with the anxiety about economic overheating and Fed tightening.”
On the vaccine front, Biden announced last week that he would direct states to make all adults eligible for the vaccine by May 1. Biden also set a goal for Americans to be able to gather in person with their friends and loved ones in small groups to celebrate the Fourth of July.

PUBLISHED THU, MAR 18 20216:21 PM EDT
CNBC’s Jim Cramer defended the Federal Reserve’s decision to leave interest rates unchanged, saying it’s a mistake to dump growth stocks out of fear of rising inflation.“Higher rates are bad for the economy. Powell doesn’t want us to take that hit if we don’t have to,” the “Mad Money” host said.“I think Jay Powell’s right to focus more on full employment than low inflation ... I bet he’ll be right about the transient nature of the commodity price increases,” he said.
CNBC’s Jim Cramer said Thursday that it’s a mistake to dump stocks in reaction to the Federal Reserve’s decision to leave the interest rate unchanged.
He defended Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who the day prior maintained the central bank’s goal to keep short-term borrowing rates low to support the U.S. economic recovery, even if inflation picks up in the near term.
“Higher rates are bad for the economy. Powell doesn’t want us to take that hit if we don’t have to,” the “Mad Money” host said. “He doesn’t want his legacy to be botching the recovery … [not after he] acted so aggressively last year to keep the economy from crashing.”
The Fed slashed rates last year in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Now many market watchers are trying to anticipate the Fed’s next move as the economy gains traction.
Mandates put in place to slow the spread of Covid-19 upended the economy and threw the country’s unemployment rate into double-digit range. The jobless rate has since fallen to 6.2% as of February, and Powell said the Fed would prioritize giving the labor market room to recover.
“I think Jay Powell’s right to focus more on full employment than low inflation ... I bet he’ll be right about the transient nature of the commodity price increases,” Cramer said.
“Wall Street freaked out last year when Powell cut rates aggressively, and they’re freaking out again now that he’s decided to keep rates” low, he added.
While a low-interest rate environment is good for stocks, not all stocks are created equal, Cramer said.
Industrial businesses are winners when rates are low, while growth names — particularly those in tech that trade on future earnings expectations — are getting hit because those later profits are not as attractive if inflation eats into their value, he said.
The Fed now projects gross domestic product to improve by 6.5% this year, up from a 4.2% projection it made in December. As the U.S. economy reopens and more consumers venture outside of the home more, cyclical companies, such as travel, will stand to benefit greatly, Cramer said.
“The Fed’s basically saying, ‘Party on, industrials,’ which causes the hedge funds to buy them hand over fist,” the host said.
“Problem is, if they want to buy the banks or the smokestack stocks … they need to sell something else,” he said, such as “the high-growth tech stocks that they always dump, and that’s called the hedge fund playbook.”

(PUBLISHED MON, MAR 22 20213:10 AM EDTUPDATED MON, MAR 22 20214:09 AM EDT)
~ The safety and efficacy analysis of the vaccine, published Monday, was based on 32,449 participants from a Phase 3 trial.
~ It comes shortly after a flurry of countries temporarily suspended use of the shot following reports of blood clots in some vaccinated people.
~ AstraZeneca said an independent data safety monitoring board identified no safety concerns related to the shot.
LONDON — The findings of a large U.S. trial have shown that the coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford is 79% effective in preventing symptomatic illness and 100% effective against severe disease and hospitalization.
The safety and efficacy analysis of the vaccine, published Monday, was based on 32,449 participants from a Phase 3 trial.
By comparison, Moderna’s vaccine has been found to be more than 94% effective in preventing Covid, and Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine was found to be 95% effective.
AstraZeneca said it would continue to analyze the data and prepare for the primary analysis to be submitted to the U.S. Food and Drugs Administration for emergency use authorization in the coming weeks.
It comes shortly after a flurry of countries temporarily suspended use of the shot following reports of blood clots in some vaccinated people. Health experts sharply criticized the move, citing a lack of data, while analysts expressed concern about the impact on vaccine uptake as the virus continues to spread.
Germany, France, Italy and Spain are among those to have resumed use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine after Europe’s drug regulator said its initial investigation of possible side effects concluded the shot is both safe and effective.
AstraZeneca said in a release Monday that an independent board identified no safety concerns related to the shot. They also conducted a specific review of blood clots as well as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), an extremely rare blood clot in the brain, with the help of an independent neurologist.
The data safety monitoring board “found no increased risk of thrombosis or events characterised by thrombosis among the 21,583 participants receiving at least one dose of the vaccine. The specific search for CVST found no events in this trial.”

(March 24): Overseas investors have been pulling out of Malaysian equities for 20 straight months. March could mark the turn of the tide.
Foreigners have poured a net US$97 million into local stocks this month through March 22, while withdrawing a combined US$1 billion from four other Southeast Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg.
The inflows come as valuation of Malaysia’s main equity gauge is now the cheapest in the region while the dividend yield of 3% is the highest among major Asia Pacific indexes after Singapore.
Foreigners becoming net buyers would mark a rare event for a market that saw global funds pull a record US$5.7 billion last year. That’s as political upheaval combined with the Covid-19 outbreak to sour sentiment even as local investors turned Malaysian glove makers into one of Asia’s hottest pandemic trades.
“There’s a thematic play for Malaysia in a sense that it has underperformed,” said Geoffrey Ng, director at Fortress Capital Asset Management Sdn Bhd. “Part of why there was so much foreign selling earlier was because of political uncertainty, which is fading now.”
Malaysia in January declared a state of emergency to tackle surging coronavirus infections. That allowed Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin to suspend parliament until the emergency ends in August, amid calls for immediate snap polls from the ruling coalition’s largest party.
Muhyiddin has said he will hold an election as soon as the pandemic is brought under control. He came to power in March last year after securing a razor-thin majority following the abrupt resignation of his predecessor Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.
Monthly withdrawals
Foreign shareholdings in Malaysian companies stood at 20.4% at the end of February, near the lowest in more than a decade, according to CGS CIMB Research. Ending March with a positive number would snap the longest run of foreign monthly withdrawals since at least 2009.
The Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index, down more than 5% from a December peak, is up 1.1% in March, poised for its best month this year. Beaten-down bluechips like casino operator Genting Bhd, banks and utilities have led the gains as new Covid-19 infections slow and vaccines are rolled out.
Even so, Credit Suisse Group AG cut Malaysia to underweight from market weight. The bank downgraded developing stocks due to a stronger US dollar, slow rollout of vaccines in the region and political risks in some commodity-exporting markets.
“Its just one month of data so we have to see if this trend continues,” said Ng.

(PUBLISHED THU, MAR 25 20216:06 PM EDTUPDATED FRI, MAR 26 20214:31 PM EDT)
U.S. stocks climbed on Friday, finishing the volatile week on a high note as stocks benefiting from a successful economic reopening outperformed again.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 453.40 points higher, or 1.4%, to 33,072.88. The blue-chip benchmark was up only 65 points earlier in the day. The S&P 500 rose 1.7% to 3,974.54, hitting a record closing high and bringing its 2021 gains to 5.8%. The Nasdaq Composite erased a 0.8% loss and ended the session 1.2% higher to 13,138.72.
All three major benchmarks rallied to their session highs into the close with the Dow jumping tacking on more than 150 points in the final 8 minutes of trading. It was broad-based late buying. Beaten-up tech like Apple rallied into the green in the final minutes. Banks, energy and materials were all big winners in the final minutes and on the day.
President Joe Biden on Thursday announced a new goal of having 200 million Covid vaccination shots being distributed within his first 100 days in office. As of Friday, 100 million coronavirus vaccinations had been given since Biden was inaugurated.
Financial stocks rose after the Federal Reserve announced that banks could resume buybacks and raise dividends starting at the end of June. The central bank originally said it would lift pandemic era restrictions in the first quarter, but even the delayed move gives investors more clarity. Shares of JPMorgan rose 1.7%, while Bank of America advanced 2.7%.
Fears of rising inflation eased after data showed tame price pressures. The core personal consumption expenditure price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 0.1% month over month, matching expectations from economists polled by Dow Jones. Year over year, the gauge climbed 1.4%, slightly lower than a 1.5% estimate.
“Softer-than-expected PCE deflator data support the idea that Treasury yields will likely consolidate over the short-term,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “The lower the baseline for inflation, the easier markets can become convinced that the upcoming pricing pressure surge will be transitory.”
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield came off its high following the inflation data, and inched back up throughout the day. The benchmark rate rose 6 basis points to 1.67%.
Meanwhile, consumer sentiment in the U.S. continued to rise amid the vaccine rollout. A University of Michigan survey released Friday showed the final reading of the index of consumer sentiment was 84.9 in March, up from 76.8 in February. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected a reading of 83.7.
The Dow and the S&P 500 posted modest gains for the week, up 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively. The Nasdaq fell 0.6% on the week, however. The market rally has slowed down in recent weeks as rising interest rates and valuation concerns hit tech names.
“The market has felt like more of a grind lately, and this may become more of the norm as we enter year two of the recovery,” said Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James. “These periods, like most, do not move in straight lines, as drawdowns will occur along the way. This is not troubling, but investors should expect some weakness and take advantage as it occurs.”

KUALA LUMPUR (March 30): RHB Research Institute has maintained ""buy"" on Mah Sing Group Bhd at 82 sen with a higher target price (TP) of RM1.02 (from 97 sen) as it foresees the group’s maiden glove manufacturing business to boost its earnings.
She opined that the contribution from glove manufacturing could possibly boost the group’s FY21 earnings by 70% to 80%.
“Given the earnings boost and its 40% dividend payout policy, we expect the dividend per share to amount to 4.6 sen and 6.3 sen for FY21 to FY22, suggesting an attractive yield of 6% to 8%, among the highest in the property sector,” she said, adding that investors should turn more confident in the group’s glove manufacturing business.

(PUBLISHED SAT, APR 3 20215:45 PM EDT)
~ The U.S. is now administering more than 3 million new Covid vaccine shots daily, based on a seven-day average of CDC data.
~ On Saturday, the public-health agency reported a record 4.1 million new doses were given.
The U.S. reported on Saturday another daily record of new Covid vaccine doses administered, pushing the weekly average of new shots per day above 3 million, according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The public-health agency on Saturday reported 4.1 million new doses were given, the highest daily mark since the Food and Drug Administration cleared vaccines for emergency use late last year.
About 104.2 million U.S. residents, or 31% of the population, have received at least one vaccine dose, according to the CDC, while 59.9 million people, or 18% of the population, are fully vaccinated. Pfizer and Moderna’s vaccines require two doses for full immunity protection; Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine, which received limited clearance in late February, is a single-shot regime.
Three-quarters of U.S. residents who are age 65 and older have received at least one vaccine dose, CDC data shows, providing crucial protection against the disease to a vulnerable group of Americans. As of March 31, nearly 81% of the country’s Covid deaths have occurred in people age 65 and up.
The rise in daily vaccine doses administered comes as available supply increases and eligibility is expanded across the nation. In states such as Texas, Kansas and Ohio, all residents age 16 and older are now able to get the vaccine.
The vaccine milestone Saturday arrives against a somewhat mixed picture for coronavirus cases and deaths in the past week. The country’s seven-day average of new daily infections sits at 64,617, up 6% compared with a week ago, according to a CNBC analysis of Johns Hopkins University data. Cases are growing in 26 states, plus Washington D.C., CNBC’s analysis shows.
However, the U.S. weekly average of new deaths per day is down 12% to 847.
President Joe Biden has urged the country to continue remaining vigilant around coronavirus spread despite significant progress on the vaccine rollout. “Too many Americans are acting as if this fight is over,” Biden said Friday. “It is not.”
Also on Friday, the CDC said people who have been fully vaccinated against Covid can travel at “low risk to themselves,” while still stressing the need to wear a mask and maintain physical distance.
“We continue to encourage every American to get vaccinated as soon as it’s their turn, so we can begin to safely take steps back to our everyday lives,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a statement that accompanied the guidance change. “Vaccines can help us return to the things we love about life, so we encourage every American to get vaccinated as soon as they have the opportunity.”

(Reuters) - The United States has administered more than 165 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the country as of Sunday morning and distributed nearly 208 million, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Sunday.
That is up from the 161,688,422 vaccine doses the CDC said had gone into arms by Saturday out of 207,866,645 doses delivered.
The agency said 106,214,924 people had received at least one vaccine dose, while 61,416,536 people have been fully vaccinated as of Sunday.
The CDC tally includes two-dose vaccines from Moderna Inc and Pfizer/BioNTech,, as well Johnson & Johnson’s one-shot vaccine as of 6:00 a.m. ET on Sunday.
A total of 7,742,126 vaccine doses have been administered in long-term care facilities, the agency said.

Until recently, Bill Hwang sat atop one of the biggest — and perhaps least known — fortunes on Wall Street. Then his luck ran out.
Mr. Hwang, a 57-year-old veteran investor, managed $10 billion through his private investment firm, Archegos Capital Management. He borrowed billions of dollars from Wall Street banks to build enormous positions in a few American and Chinese stocks. By mid-March, Mr. Hwang was the financial force behind $20 billion in shares of ViacomCBS, effectively making him the media company’s single largest institutional shareholder. But few knew about his total exposure, since the shares were mostly held through complex financial instruments, called derivatives, created by the banks."

(PUBLISHED SUN, APR 4 20216:03 PM EDTUPDATED MON, APR 5 20214:06 PM EDT)
U.S. stocks climbed to record highs on Monday as a strong bounce in U.S. job growth and solid data in the services sector raised expectations for a swift economic recovery from the pandemic.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 373.98 points to 33,527.19, a record closing high. The S&P 500 gained 1.4% to 4,077.91, also hitting a new record close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also climbed 1.7% to 13,705.59.
The Labor Department reported Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 in March, the highest since August 2020, while the unemployment rate fell to 6%. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were expecting an increase of 675,000 and a jobless rate of 6%.
Meanwhile, a measure of U.S. services industry activity soared to a record high in March. The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing activity index jumped to a reading of 63.7 last month, the highest level in the survey’s history.
“A ‘Capital V’ recovery that is in the early innings,” said Tony Dwyer, Canaccord Genuity’s chief market strategist. “The only thing that could stand in the way would be another shutdown of the economy to contain new Covid-19 strains or a policy mistake by the Fed. Neither appear imminent.”
Tesla shares popped more than 4% as the electric vehicle company reported production and delivery figures that broadly beat expectations.
GameStop shares cut their double-digit losses and closed down about 2% after the video game retailer said it may sell up to $1 billion worth of stock.
Classic reopening plays like airlines and cruise operators outperformed. Delta Airlines and United jumped more than 2% each, while Carnival and Norwegian Cruise Line gained 4.7% and 7.2%, respectively.
Bond yields, whose sudden advance spooked some investors in recent weeks, continued to ease. The 10-year Treasury yield fell slightly to 1.71% on Monday.
“We expect equities and other risk assets to be supported by the new nominal — a more muted response of government yields to stronger growth and higher inflation than in the past as central banks lean against any sharp yield rises,” Wei Li, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, said in a note.
The stock market is building on its recent strength after President Joe Biden introduced his multitrillion-dollar infrastructure proposal, which focuses on rebuilding roads, bridges and airports, expanding broadband access and boosting electric vehicle use and updating the country’s electric grid. The plan will be funded partly by a hike in the corporate tax rate to 28%.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday pushed for a global minimum corporate tax in an effort to keep companies from relocating to find lower rates.
However, Biden’s plan faces opposition among Republicans as the $2 trillion plan includes initiatives that they say extend beyond traditional infrastructure issues.
Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri on Sunday urged the Biden administration to pare back the package to roughly $615 billion and concentrate on physical infrastructure such as roads and airports.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said last week that Biden’s plan would not receive Republican support and vowed to oppose the broader Democratic agenda.
On the pandemic front, the U.S. reported another daily record of new Covid vaccinations Saturday, pushing the weekly average of new shots per day above 3 million.

(PUBLISHED MON, APR 5 20216:37 PM EDT)
~ “I think there’s a level of surprise coming in April because we already had a strong finish beginning Wednesday of last week,” Fundstrat’s Tom Lee told CNBC on Monday.
~ Lee said he believes the S&P 500 could rally roughly 3% by the end of the month.
Tom Lee said Monday he expects the stock market’s strong start to April to continue throughout the month as part of what he’s previously dubbed a “face-ripper rally.”
The co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors made his case in an interview on CNBC’s “Fast Money,” following the S&P 500′s 1.4% gain Monday to notch a record close of 4,077.91.
“Institutions raised almost $200 billion of cash since the start of the year, so they’ve turned quite cautious, and they’ve been fading or selling their tech and growth holdings but they’ve only just begun to nibble on the ... epicenter [stocks],” said Lee, whose firm considers those to be companies that were among the hardest-hit in the pandemic but stand to gain from the economic recovery.
“So, I think there’s a level of surprise coming in April because we already had a strong finish beginning Wednesday of last week. It’s really three days of strong rallies and history shows this is really building up to be what could be a, potentially, S&P 4,200 before the end of the month,” Lee said.
The broad equity index reaching that level would represent roughly 3% upside from Monday’s close.
Additionally, Lee said it would make the April rally “something that is both really strong but, more importantly, quite a big surprise for institutions.”
As for what happens after a so-called face-ripper rally, Lee said there could be a period of choppy trading.
“I think if the S&P does in fact rally strongly this month at a time when institutions are sitting on so much cash and there’s so much skepticism on this market, we could see a big chase and that could mark the high for the year,” he said. “I wouldn’t say that’s our base case, but yes, we would have to consolidate these gains.”

(PUBLISHED TUE, APR 6 20218:31 AM EDTUPDATED TUE, APR 6 20218:38 AM EDT)
~ The latest round of fiscal stimulus in the U.S. along with the vaccine rollouts across the world have made the Fund more confident about the global economy this year.
~ The latest forecasts suggest the United States is well placed to experience a solid economic recovery in 2021, in contrast to what’s expected for most of the world, where many economies are likely to take longer to return to their pre-crisis levels.
LONDON — The International Monetary Fund is now expecting a stronger economic recovery in 2021 as Covid-19 vaccine rollouts get underway, but it warns of “daunting challenges” given the different rates of administering shots across the globe.
On Tuesday the group said it expects the world economy to grow by 6% in 2021, up from its 5.5% forecast in January.
Looking further ahead, global GDP (gross domestic product) for 2022 is seen increasing by 4.4%, higher than an earlier estimate of 4.2%.
“Even with high uncertainty about the path of the pandemic, a way out of this health and economic crisis is increasingly visible,” Gita Gopinath, the IMF’s chief economist, said in the latest World Economic Outlook report.
The latest round of fiscal stimulus in the U.S., along with the vaccine rollouts across the world, have made the fund more confident about the global economy this year.
“Nonetheless, the outlook presents daunting challenges related to divergences in the speed of recovery both across and within countries and the potential for persistent economic damage from the crisis,” Gopinath also said.
The IMF estimated a 5.1% GDP rate for advanced economies this year, with the United States growing at a pace of 6.4% in 2021.
Meanwhile, the forecast for emerging and developing economies is 6.7% in 2021, with India expected to grow as much as 12.5%.
“Within-country income inequality will likely increase because young workers and those with relatively lower skills remain more heavily affected in not only advanced but also emerging markets and developing economies,” Gita warned, while also adding that lower levels of female employment is exacerbating disparities too.
As a result, the IMF said that governments should continue to focus on “escaping the crisis” by providing fiscal support, including to their healthcare systems. In a second phase, “policymakers will need to limit long-term economic scarring” from the crisis and boost public investment, for instance.
“Without additional efforts to give all people a fair shot, cross-country gaps in living standards could widen significantly, and decades-long trends of global poverty reduction could reverse,” Gopinath warned.
Recovery in the U.S.
The latest forecasts suggest the United States is well placed to experience a solid economic recovery in 2021, in contrast to what’s expected for most of the world, where many economies are likely to take longer to return to their pre-crisis levels.
The positive assessment for the U.S. is highly driven by President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue package, which entered into force last month.
As such, unemployment in the United States is expected to fall from 8.1% in 2020 to 5.8% this year and then again to 4.1% in 2022, according to the latest IMF projections.
Back in February, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the U.S. could return to full employment in 2022. “There’s absolutely no reason why we should suffer through a long slow recovery,” she told CNN at the time.
The IMF’s latest forecasts confirm that the U.S. is on track to not only return but surpass its pre-Covid levels this year.
“Among advanced economies, the United States is expected to surpass its pre-Covid GDP level this year, while many others in the group will return to their pre-COVID levels only in 2022,” Gita said.

(April 7, 2021, 6:10 PM GMT+8Updated on April 7, 2021, 9:39 PM GMT+8)
Jamie Dimon said he’s optimistic the pandemic will end with a U.S. economic rebound that could last at least two years.
“I have little doubt that with excess savings, new stimulus savings, huge deficit spending, more QE, a new potential infrastructure bill, a successful vaccine and euphoria around the end of the pandemic, the U.S. economy will likely boom,” the JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief executive officer said Wednesday in his annual letter to shareholders. “This boom could easily run into 2023.”
Unprecedented federal rescue programs have blunted unemployment and averted further economic deterioration, according to Dimon, who said banks entered the crisis strong and able to help communities weather the storm. While lenders also benefited from U.S. stimulus, they built up buffers against future loan losses and performed well in stress tests, he said.
Dimon also pointed to U.S. consumers, who used stimulus checks to reduce debt to the lowest level in 40 years and stashed them in savings, giving them -- like corporations -- an “extraordinary” amount of spending power once lockdowns end. The latest round of quantitative easing measures will have created more than $3 trillion in deposits at U.S. banks, a portion of which can be lent out, he said.
It could all add up to a Goldilocks moment, according to Dimon, where growth is fast and sustained while inflation ticks up gently. Threats to that outcome include virus variants and a rapid or sustained jump in inflation that prompts rates to rise sooner.
At 65, Dimon is the most prominent executive in global banking, serving as a spokesman for the industry while leading a titan of both Wall Street and consumer lending. He’s run the company since the end of 2005, and is the only CEO still at the helm after steering a major bank through the financial crisis.
The 65-page letter (plus a page of footnotes) is Dimon’s longest yet, following last year’s abbreviated one that came less than a week after he returned to work from emergency heart surgery. As always, it is wide-ranging, touching on topics from financial regulation to China to inequality and institutional racism.

(Kitco News) - The Federal Reserve recently discontinued updating the M1 and M2 weekly money supply series and is instead updating the series monthly.
Steve Hanke, professor of Applied Economics of Johns Hopkins University, said that this change reflects a change in attitude from the world's largest central bank on the importance of looking at money supply.
""Chairman Powell has very explicitly claimed that money doesn't matter in recent testimony. He's basically said that money and the measurement of money doesn't really matter because it's unrelated to inflation,"" Hanke said.
These money supply series have been published since the 1970s, and the fact that the Fed has changed the publishing frequency on M1 and M2 money supply from weekly to monthly demonstrates a change in worldviews, Hanke said."

SO if stock is stagnent ( eg 8.30 for whole year), Fund managers dont make any money. they will sell ata a loss so that you panic and sell low and chanse when the price is going up ( 98% human tendency) So , to beat them , accept that they are manuipulating the price downwards to buy from you and sell when they have upped the price like 5-8% when everybody starts chasing the shares ( you sell to them) which is very hard to do. A div rate of 5-6% wont cover the fat fund managers salary, AND you also got to remember shareslike Astino can be manipulated to show profit for many years and suddenly let you hold tight when they decide to run and u end up losing your capital but shares like PBB and MBB will go to sero or get delisted. In order for you to get the best out of your money is by buying 0% into safe shares and 30% into goreng stocks... so u still have money if goreng stocks go bust and enjoy capital growth when it goes up gila gila ( where you sell off and wait for another round of dips and rises)"

(Source: Xinhua| 2021-04-13 23:29:38|Editor: huaxia)
WASHINGTON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Asia's economy is expected to grow by 7.6 percent this year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Tuesday, while warning of ""huge uncertainty"" surrounding the projections.
""The pandemic has resulted in unprecedented output losses in the Asia-Pacific region,"" Jonathan D. Ostry, acting director of the IMF's Asia and Pacific Department, said during a virtual news conference.
The pandemic is receding in some countries, elsewhere, ""second or third waves of infections are raging,"" notably in India and some of the ASEAN economies, he noted, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
Noting that divergence is multi-dimensional, namely across countries, and within countries across sectors, age groups, gender and skill level, Ostry said a region known for its trademark growth-with-equity model now runs the risk of ""entrenching excessive inequality.""
For China, growth has been marked up to 8.4 percent this year due to stronger net exports, reflecting higher global growth and the U.S. fiscal stimulus, according to the IMF.
India, meanwhile, has seen a more sizeable upward revision to 12.5 percent on account of continued normalization of its economy and a more growth-friendly fiscal policy, ""but the current surge in infections presents a worrisome downside risk,"" Ostry said.
He noted that there is huge uncertainty surrounding Asia's projections, highlighting downside risks such as setbacks in vaccine rollouts, questions about the potency of the vaccine against new variants of the disease, and a resurgence of the virus.
The changing external environment is also a central driver of risk in the region, given Asia's outward orientation to trade and capital flows, Ostry said.
""If U.S. yields rise faster than markets expect, or if there is miscommunication about future U.S. monetary policy, adverse spillovers through financial channels and capital outflows, as during the 2013 taper tantrum, could present challenges by compromising macro-financial stability,"" he said.
Noting that trade has been a powerful driver of growth and poverty alleviation in Asia for decades, Ostry said restrictions that impede trade need to be reduced, and the easing of trade and technology tensions and facilitation of digital trade would provide a welcome boost to growth.

This is arguably also the first occurrence involving Malaysia's corporate.
In a statement today, Maybank chairman Tan Sri Datuk Sri Zamzamzairani conveyed the bank's deepest apologies to all shareholders for the inconvenience caused and would be notifying them of the new meeting date in due course.
""We appreciate that our shareholders had taken time to try to login today to follow the proceedings of the meeting and wish to assure all of them that we will be reaching out to them to update them of the next meeting arrangements,"" he said in a statement today.

(PUBLISHED THU, APR 15 20218:48 AM EDTUPDATED THU, APR 15 202111:44 AM EDT)
~ BlackRock CEO Larry Fink noted that a host of factors are likely to propel markets higher in the near term, even as the S&P 500 and the Dow hover near record levels.
~ “I believe because of monetary stimulus, fiscal stimulus, the cash on the sidelines, earnings, the markets are OK. Markets are going to continue to be stronger,” he predicted.
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said Thursday he’s optimistic about financial markets as the economy attempts to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.
“I am incredibly bullish on the markets,” Fink said in an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” He noted that a host of factors are likely to propel markets higher in the near term, even as the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average hover near record levels.
“I believe because of monetary stimulus, fiscal stimulus, the cash on the sidelines, earnings, the markets are OK. Markets are going to continue to be stronger,” said the co-founder and chairman of the world’s largest asset manager.
“A big reason why there’s so much cash sitting on the sidelines during Covid and during remote working our behaviors have changed dramatically,” Fink explained, noting the amount of money many commuters are saving by not going into work.
“Whether the money is coming from a stimulus check or is coming from savings or behavior changes for savings, I think it’s fantastic that we’re seeing more people either investing for the long term or even trading,” he added.
Fink also commented on BlackRock’s institutional client base, which includes pensions funds, saying climate change and inflation risk are bigger concerns to them than cryptocurrencies.
Fink on Covid vaccines, budget deficits
The BlackRock CEO cautioned near-term risks to the stock market do exist. Fink said the arrival of coronavirus variants that dramatically reduce the effectiveness of Covid vaccines is the biggest one.
Long term, Fink said, the government deficit — which has grown as the U.S. Congress passed trillions of dollars worth of pandemic stimulus to support the economy— poses a more of a threat.
“Deficits right now are not a big issue, and that’s what the markets are saying,” Fink contended. “They’re not a big issue because the amount of money that’s on the sideline, the amount of capital that is trying to be put to work.”
However, Fink said the strength of the economy in the years ahead could change his outlook.
“If we don’t have economic growth that is sustainable over the next 10 years — and I’m saying economic growth that is above 3% — our deficits are going to matter, and they are going to elevate interest rates at some time,” he said.
Fink’s comments came after BlackRock reported first-quarter results that beat Wall Street expectations. The company’s assets under management also increased to just over $9 trillion, up 39% from $6.47 trillion in the same quarter a year ago.

I really can't stand the majority shareholder ASB selling everyday by the millions. Not pushing up to support the price is already Bad enough, selling heavily some more.

MBB has to wait for Bursa approval as it involves issuence of new shares for DRIP... that's why MBB can declare a high dividend yield as they do not pay cash from the cash register and pay ypu with shares only.. so high dividend also just on paer only.. if u want cash.. u sell and other investors pay their dividend value.. so it is a win win and you take the risk of price going up or down... and because of this they give you a discount of 4-5% (usually) from the market price when they declare DRIP"

Irregardless of their reasons , if the price rallies , the drp price will be higher and vice versa obviously.
So looks like , besides the theory mentioned , about controlling the flow of funds. They could also be trying to control the drp price as well with these actions.

(Bloomberg News / May 10, 2021, 7:07 AM GMT+8)
U.S. deaths from Covid-19 have been undercounted, President Joe Biden’s top medical adviser said, with the nationwide toll approaching 582,000. New cases in the U.S. dropped over the past week to the slowest pace since the end of September. Hospitalizations dipped to a seven-month low.
With more than a third of its adult population now fully vaccinated, the U.K. reported just two virus deaths on Sunday. The European Union hasn’t renewed its order for the AstraZeneca Plc vaccine beyond June.

Washington's growing deficit drives central banks to euro, yen and gold
TOKYO -- The share of U.S. dollar-denominated assets in the world's foreign reserves sank for the fifth straight year in 2020 to 59%, its lowest level in a quarter century, as emerging economies like China and Russia diversify holdings amid concerns over the greenback's prospects.
Russian holdings are plunging as well. Russia's international reserves including gold totaled $578.7 billion as of September, according to data released by its central bank. Dollar-denominated assets made up roughly 20% of this tally, down from about half in 2017.
Russia began dumping dollar assets after the U.S. imposed economic sanctions on the country for its annexation of Crimea. Turkey and Brazil have also been shifting away from U.S. government bonds in recent years.
Instead, countries are turning to nondollar assets. Euro-denominated assets made up 21% of global allocated reserves at the end of 2020, according to the IMF, recovering to where they were six years prior. Some market watchers believe the euro has risen in popularity after the European Union issued common bonds on behalf of all of its members to fund its coronavirus response."

MAYBANK hosted a briefing to share its 5-year plan and strategies to achieve planned targets by 2025. Fundamentally, these targets include: (i) sustainable ROEs of 13-15%; (ii) CIR (cost to income ratio) of less than 45%; and (iii) EPS of above 100.0 sen (accounting for future dividend reinvestments).
Buy with a TP of RM10.60 or a PBV of 1.37x derived from a higher applied ROE of 11% (which is below management’s 5-year target of 13-15%."

Farid highlighted that Maybank has made a whopping non-performing loan provision of RM4.6 billion in 2020 which has also taken into account the likelihood of impairment this year.
“Most of it is done on the basis of macroeconomic variables to prepare Maybank for the eventual possibilities that there will be impairment come 2021.
“That is why the level of provisions was heightened in 2020, compared with 2019,” he told reporters in a virtual briefing following its 61st annual general meeting (AGM) held earlier
“To some extent, if you've seen some of the banks in the US, especially, they have reversed some of the provisions in the fourth quarter, but we did not make such a reversal,” said Farid, explaining that the macroeconomic variables have to be sustainable before the bank shall make any reversal.
Thus, he mentioned that the most recent imposition of MCO 3.0 is consistent with what the bank has anticipated from last year."

---------------------------------
Thanks for your advice.
However, the stock market is filled with all kinds of investors and traders, you can't talk bad about others simply because they have different trading styles and objectives with you.
For example, your objective could be dividend incomes and long-term capital appreciation. My trading style and objective are short-term driven, where I attempt (and succeed) to grow my capital by multiple folds. My trading strategy works for me and it allowed me to minimize losses and have a high percentage of successful trades. Doing so reduces or even eliminates my exposure to the potential US market overnight big correction.
Note: I do not hold any stock or warrant as of now. Might buy back anytime when I deem it is worth the risk-return tradeoff."

Lately , they have been pushing down the price to keep the drp price low. They succeeded. Now , they are trying to collect as they have sold a lot over the last few weeks for this purpose. But naturally , they want to collect cheap.
Creating large fluctuations in price to scare retail investors and traders. Quite successfully in fact. Hard to predict, but I suspect 8.60 to 8.80 in the short term is quite possible. Depending on the QR report obviously and other political / pandemic factors. We shall see i guess."

With CIMB I could specify how many shares I received under DRP up to the maximum allowed (based on the strike price and my DRP dividend allowance). As I am (will be) a long term holder I just bought as many as allowed, including an odd lot. That can be balanced out in the future"

From odd lots to become normal ??
In my case with CMB it would take a couple of dividend rounds to enable me to balance in full lots. If you have more shares you can specify just enough DRP shares to balance the odd lot at the next round.
Having the maximum DRP shares ensures you make maximum advantage of the dividend as the odd lots also generate dividend.
If you take everything cash and then purchase MMB shares, you would waste quite a bit of money buying shares on the open market as the MMB share price is showing today. If you want to use the money to buy other shares, then OK. However, MMB seems to be the best bang for the buck (dividend cents per ringgit invested) in terms of share price, resilience and security - better than Tenaga which a number of punters are very enthusiastic about."

You start bussiness with friends in January with RM100. Every month u company profit RM1.
So end of the year ur bussiness has RM112. ANd u secide to share the profit of RM12 among yourselves.
Now company is left with RM100 worth. and RM12 in ur pockets. Balance right?
Same with MBB , he give u the profit as dividend, how u expect him not to deduct it from the company?
Same rule!! Nobody will pay RM112 for a RM100 company... but they see the company can profit so good... they will expect better profit in future and valae ur company more just like MBB is doing now..
Now imagine if ur company lose RM1 per month and end of yr ur company is worth RM88... ur expect people to buy ur company at RM100 or RM112 or RM98?... same as MBB shares rules apply also,

I predict this price will move down after this distribution phase000 IT will be back to 8.00-8.10 range and the Funds will sell slowly so as to sell as much as they can and show nice profit to their management and get big gaji and bonus.

Public Bank : 8.80 (on 9th Apr)
Lets see who the liars or rotten analyst are from where!! Next round flock them to hell by calling up the brokerages!
So how now? It is actually 8.60 (divvy considered).. still not reached by today and closest is PBB analyst.
Thank you."

1. what is ex date (is it the last date to accumulate the stock or is it the date the divide is paid out ) ?
2.now that the share price has dropped will it recalibrate our average price or will our average price remain same ?
3. when would we be given the choice to but units or fully claim divided and when would it be paid out ?
4. how much is the price of the stocks offered for dividends ?
thank you"

1. ex date is the date that the existing shareholders are recorded for the dividend payment. after this date, even if you sell ur stocks u will still be eligible for the dividend payment sometime later. Viceversa, if u dont own the company s stock before the ex date you are not eligible to the dividend. after ex date the company s share price will usually drop by the same amount of the dividend paid out.
2. dont understand your question, they issue dividend based on the number of stocks you have, not the share price. e.g. you own 1000 maybank shares, dividend you get is 1000 x rm 0.385 = rm380.
3. as a shareholder, you can choose to subscribe to dividend investment plan ( if there is one) or not subscribe to one and just collect dividend fully. for this dividend, date of payment is 28 jun 2021.
4. rm7.55"

DRIP portion: .21/.385= 54.55%

Fees: RM13/RM525.04= 2.47%

If you plan to remain investing in Maybank you should maximise your DRP allowance*, you will then get the maximum benefit of the dividend. One caveat, as long as the share price remains above (or at) the strike price of RM7.55. The cost of buying the shares is RM13 while the minimum broker cost (PB2U) is RM28 ++.
* in my case including odd-lots as they also earn dividend and can be rounded down into a full lot at a future date."

I was recently quoted in the media that the government cannot compel banks to give a blanket moratorium, and this was subsequently taken out of context by opportunistic quarters promoting their populist agenda. To clarify, under the Central Bank of Malaysia Act 2009 (CBA) and the Financial Services Act 2013 (FSA), the Minister of Finance does not have the authority to instruct the banks to give an automatic moratorium. Further, under the current Emergency (Essential Powers) Ordinance 2021, any new legislation has to be approved by Cabinet and then presented to the Yang Dipertuan Agong for His Royal Highness’ assent.
Section 4 of the Emergency Ordinance confers powers to the government to acquire and mobilise any resources necessary for public good, but Section 5 clearly stipulates that any compulsory measure by the government must be matched by a compensation to the party that has yielded its resources.

Surely the funds have to make a profit, how do they do that if they drive the price down? I for sure will accumulate if the price gets more attractive - it's already interesting at RM8.2.
If they could manage to drive the price down, they should have done that from when the DRP option was released to the shareholders to the time they need to be submitted - people would then take the cash option."

Especially after good qtr results
That’s why go for max drp"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000318.jsp?ftp=301","Jun 8, 2021 6:08 PM","tollebunsmith","bobvic96: It works like this. They Fund which has big intrest in MBB will influence u to take up drp . Hence u will get less cash and u will keep that cash. Once u wait for the new shares to be able to sell (rich investors wont bother and just accumulate) the fund will keep selling push the price down.
SO when u are able to sell the new drp shares the prices are quite low ( but not near 7.22) so u will be forced to sell lower than this price (8.20). Then the fund will pick it off the weak sellers and after sometime they will push it again to sell off... Remember this : Price Fund keep high now:8.20
Your DRP 7.55. They push down (perhaps)7.90. Then up again to 8.25// they sell ur drp and make good profit...
Why dont we study if this happens .. u can check to see if i am right or wrong.... after all these are my opinion...... Thanks... Even if i am wrong , we will do the oppisite the next drp round.... ok?"

Usually, shares drop in value after the ex-date, MBB and a couple of others I hold have been quite resilient in maintaining their share price, one even increasing..
""Even if i am wrong , we will do the oppisite the next drp round.... ok?""
Maybe, I'll consider what the options are at that time."

All else being equal, a share price increase is negative if you want to reinvest your dividend, that is unless the dividend increases at a higher rate (work it out on a spreadsheet, it is scary).
Look at MBB's share price history and dividend, you can't do much better in terms of dividend cents per ringgit invested with a (apparent) low risk.

A: Tue, 29 Jun 2021, 10:10 AM
Banks have agreed to provide 6-mth loan moratorium to all consumer & micro SME borrowers. However, it will be on an opt-in model, unlike the 1st automatic loan deferment. Hence, we believe there is unlikely to have significant impact to banks and in any case, day 1 modification loss is a non-cash accounting entry & is gradually reversible in the future. Thus, we are treating it as an exceptional item. Overall, we expect negligible price reaction on the above development and price weakness is an opportunity to accumulate.
Maintain OVERWEIGHT; BUY calls include: Maybank, Public, RHB, BIMB & Affin.

Unlikely to have significant impact to banks, considering this is an opt-in model, which may deter non-affected borrowers to exploit this relief vs the 1st automatic loan moratorium. In our view, troubled borrowers would remain largely similar to before and thus, we do not expect to see a meaningful uptick in targeted assistance as a % of outstanding loan exposure. From our channel checks, the level of targeted repayment assistance take-up rate has stabilized over the past 1 quarter and is currently beneath 15%, better vs banks’ initial average guidance of 15-20%"

For those who have to stay invested, we recommend accumulating MAYBANK (OP; TP: RM10.65) as its strong dividend yield potential (7-8%) will continue to provide cushion to investors seeking a long-term position. Additionally, despite being the leader in loans market share, it commands a fair GIL ratio of c.2% (within industry average). To us, this indicates that its books are well guarded with tight asset quality checks."

Finance Minister Tengku Datuk Seri Zafrul Abdul Aziz said on Tuesday the banks will, however, waive the compounded interest or the interest charged on interest accrued during the six-month moratorium period, as well as any penalty charges.
The method of repayment, including on interest charges, is “between the borrowers and the banks”.

Additionally, its GIL ratio is still fairly within the industry average of c.2.2% which indicates the bank has sound asset quality measures despite being the market leader (c.30% financing share) between the 10 banks within our coverage. Further, its high fixed-rate loan mix (c.28%) is offset by its high CASA-to-deposit ratio (c. 40%) to cushion OPR fluctuations in the near-term.

Stock : MAYBANK Price Target : 10.75 | Price Call : BUY
Last Price : 8.12 | Upside/Downside : +2.63 (32.39%)
Henceforth, our top pick for 3QCY21 is MAYBANK (OP; TP: RM10.75) as its industry-leading dividend yield (7-8%) and dividend-to-ROE would provide sizeable buffers for investors seeking a long-term play amidst ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. Additionally, its GIL ratio is still fairly within the industry average of c.2.2% which indicates the bank has sound asset quality measures despite being the market leader (c.30% financing share) between the 10 banks within our coverage.

And one more thing, just investing in msia is NOT good enough, and I am slowly venturing outside of this country. Many here has already ventured out to Singapore and US markets. And with the latest development , I will try to try small small direct invest in overseas marts. I had a friend who started overseas mart etc and he is has mads lots of money. So hope u guys venture out and start slowly and carefully branch overseas cos i feel msia mart is too inefficient but my keyword is safety and stability and sustainability will be my guide.
PS:I am on robo adviser and the returns are not too braggable and fluctuates within a range which is not to my liking. I will soon liquidate it and invest direct BUT these seems to be witholding taxes and stuff which needs to be studied first.

I do not see what that would change from a tax point of view. I believe the only way to avoid US tax is if you live in a country with a dual tax agreement with them - you will still end up paying tax somewhere.
One interesting point on my gold shares, last month I received two dividends, the one I listed above and, from the same company a ""Return of capital"" dividend of USD 140.51 which was US tax free only Foreign Agent Fee of $1.45 and Nominee Fee of $1.34 deducted. I wasn't expecting this but a pleasant surprise.
PS, I may have sold 60% of my US stocks too early."

Well done, I was very tempted but expected the price to go down again today but, as usual, I was wrong (at least so far). My advice is to do the opposite of what I do. My average is 8.17 up from below 8.00 when I increased my holding last month by a factor of 5 (still a modest number)."

Maybank is one of the best on Bursa.
Do a bit of research comparing different companies dividend and share price. Make sure the dividend is consistent and preferably going up.
Create a spreadsheet and calculate how many dividend cents you get per ringgit invested. I calculate the average and median dividends over, say, 5 years to give an idea of what you may get - those with more brains may do better statistical analysis.
Put your results in a table and sort on the dividend cents per ringgit. Obviously you may have to consider downturns, etc. such as Ambank's 1MDB fiasco (which really annoys me).
I also run a ""prediction"" over 5-10 years to see what the benefits of dividend reinvestment achieves - very simple as you have to make assumptions on share price and dividend. One thing that stands out in this is that inflation of the share price is very detrimental to the returns unless dividend goes up accordingly.
You will see the lower you can average your share buying price the better the %age dividend returns.
The advantage of Maybank is it is 'blue chip' and long term you may get the benefit of a share price increase.
As everyone says, do your own research and this is not a buy or sell call."

So my knowledge is limited. I dont do crypto and my risk is moderarte only as i want to preserve my capital and grow moderately.
I am currently researching direct investment in US , but i have to be careful as transaction loss. double currency conversion and holding fees, tax and hidden cost are my worries. As i feel small amounts not significant and big amounts makes me worry .
And mind too that a superbull run has occured in Dow and i am afraid i am too late and might catch a bear market or retraction as i am risk averse. It it keeps going up ( which i think is not probable) the u are lucky. And i dont have the luxery or dollar cost averaging. SO i guess i am stuck in bursa at this moment.
So i am just starting small and robo is not the way as i found that my investment reurns are not growing much although the us mart is heading towards 35k. And compared with the 4.06 to 1 MYR now it is heading towards 4.20 and i expect weaker myr due to stability.

Tolle, I agree about crypto and being cautious.
As I said I sold 75% of my USA shares as I thought a correction was coming. Had I waited a few days I would have cashed an extra $3k.
To my credit, I have always predicted a crash or correction, it's just that my timing is hopeless.
I suggest you consider keeping your money in MY until the correction comes, you may even get a better exchange rate then - you could look up historical exchange rates with USA market dips."

If u are looking at long term like 2 to 3 yrs, i will just buy it staggered like 10% now, and it price goes up a bit like 8.20.. buya a bit more, but it if falls beloe 7.0, buy 20-30 % and start loading as it stays around any price bit by bit.. so if run up also u can money, run down also cab top up and when economy shoots up, u will be in front of most.
These people were holding maybank when it was rm9, and also when it was RM10. and most of us here avarage round 7.35-7.55 and some lucky ones at 6.99. If u see MBB at 6.99 something , just sapu like 30%, and go somewhere and dont look at it for a year or two, then come back and see the price.

Do remember that pakat-pakat/manipulation by big fund manager is normal. But we cannot predict the market too accurately. if we can even a 60% accuracy will make us millions.
The short answer is depends on sentiment, so buy in trances, so you dont miss the boat.

Just remember , no matter how low u buy this shar during the past few weeks , u CANNOT sell cos they purposely keep the price within a range , so if u sell or buy no profit also, except for a few token lots ( which is also too small a profit) so u are stuck, but only for the profiteering people, if u investor, ypu just keep buying in small quantities all year long as soon as u got money. Ypu also buy ifu think it is more cheap to average down and collect."

Small oppurtunities if used widely and consistantly over time, earns more than one hit share surge and just make sure u are not greedy, u will do better.
Never sell or buy on emotion cos the chances are u will always regret it later, If u have emotion, just sell a token number of shares and look back the next day, usually u would regret for buting or selling at that price. ( my personal experience)"

AmBank paid RM2.83 billion+RM53.7 mil = RM2.88 bil 1MDB scandal.
So how many years to earn back that money as profit per yr is about 1 billion per yr, so must wait after 2 yrs only got profit.
So wait or buy now? actually , they waiting to goreng using pump and dump/
Would u buy a loss making comapny or a successful company.
The penalty also shw the bank got no integrity, a trust compay without trust. I dont want to own a cheating company, against my belief... bad karma....
2) If management is so untrustworthy , would fund managers trust them again? same management , same people? ANd what makes u believe they wont do it again? Another way of looking at it is , is someone screws ur bakside, would u trust them with ur bakside again? ( pun intended) Lol

Lets say u gian and buy at 107 5 lots (5000 shares) and see it going up to 1.20.. u feel happy and add more 5 lots (5000 shares) as u want to do a killing and make a lot of money... suddenly u see it drop to 1.14.. and think, yesterday it went down a bit and later it went up and become full house... if today no full also p to 1.30 als i make lots of money... i will wait at the end at 4.45 to make decision.
If the price pulls back, almost all the retail investers or punters wont sell or the new registerd cds accounts holders also wont sell.
Then what , u think u win? ... ALL these numbers you see are DIRECTED by certain groups and they will guide the volume so chartist will follow and use that info to buy or sell.. u think smart money so bodo to give free lunch?...
HAHA .. they unload and they never tell u u just didnt make a few hundreds but actually lost RM10k plus cos u are stuck.
The smart money already took their profit and park in other shares which they will goreng later... it will slowly go down bit by bit by bit just like ... (insert any other shares).. Esceram, Notion tech, SCIB etc.... etyc.. so u actual loss ( of oppurtunity ) is A LOT GREATER THAN U THINK.
and thats how smart moneys winns

( buying at 8.04 when it was lower earlier at 7.99/8.00) They call it FOMO ( fear of missing out).. u scare it will go 8.15/8.16.. so when it moves up a little . u buy at any price... so smart money always pushes the price up by a bit, nothing significant, but it does work to make people buy instantly... trap in the sense makes u buy when u dont need it... like what shoppe /lazada does when they do BIG SALES.. people buy more then they want.... selling some products at a losing price so that they make up in other products or volume... in other words we call LOSS LEADERS.
I remember when i worked in a supermarket, i had a a chance to service the bosses and consignment agents who will bargain at what price to display their products, EYELEVEL DSIPLAY get the most expensive price tag.. ( where the supermart get more net financial gain then lower out sight placements.
So that translates to share where they show u that big volume at certain price ( like a few millions per sapu, when in actual fact they pakat among themselves and boost confidence that makes retail buyer happy and start to buy also, and retail will sway themselves into buying with words like "" aiyaa just 20ringgit more perl lot... if price moves 2 sen also i can cover. "" That's how retailers excuse their mistakes.
So what do i do?, early morning start to place order a few sen lower... although the queue is a lot.. like maybe i am after the 300,000 only is my order, After placement i dont watch and if at anytime , my shares takes a bit hit or goes crazy, my remiser will call me... she only called me for 3 counters the same day hit limit up. but i didnt sell on that day. Second limit up also sdisnt sell.. until i see drop a lot .. so i cashed out and with that bought into MBB big... although the price was higher and i did regret buying MBB at a highr price as as my remiser advised ( my excuse was , aiyaa two three hundred per lot only, from profit only, dont care laa"" , I should have waited to get it low 7... what can i do? FOMO and i was damn excited... so after that i learned NOT to do emotional buys or sales.

All shares are traded on the PRECEIVED value of that share, lets say MBB or TOPGLOVE, how is the price set? it is not the actual calulation that sets it price of how much it earns or assets it has or cash, but the future value it can make and the preceived valuation or the syndicate or people trending at the moment ( like tech stock are very capable of earning in future).. so you must be able to predict before people start chasing the shares... another example is hwatai,, where they preceive that peropl buy biscuits for what?... and suddenly it is limit up.. another example is vax counter few months back, which hit limit up.. then suddenly going back to original price when the dust settled.. so must be able to read what is the future trend , buy before others & accumulate and sell when everybody is chasing it.... so sit down and think very hard when the next big thing is.. just like reits will fly when there are no more covid, BUT WHEN? if i know the answer, i will sit beside warren buffet and have him buy me a drink... BUT we a got lot of share advisers on you tube and bloggers , where they ask us to pay them to get tips,,, and u wonder why they themselves dont corner the market and earn the millions.. funny right? well they become kaya with our money , just like my very rich friend kena burn with property guru who offloaded lousy properties where the developer could not sell and sold them to him at inflated prices...bt the gurus are just selling advice and eqrning commisions.... u think about it."

1.political stability , no strength leaders
2. Covid lockdown ( not factored in banking sector)
3. lower growth , as other industries are affected, so banks also
4. banks may not pay dividend or if pay also lower quantum cos want to conserve cash for future weakend quaters
5.even if this dividend is good, BUT fund managers will NOT buy cos share price is propotional to FUTURE earnings... so most big funds will wait and see and let share price drift lower
7. I honestly dont know
If i want to buy, i will buy staggered, or cost averaging. buy portion by portion,, so if price drop also can average better price than ur neighbour and u have first strike to sell and profit more than me

8.11 is quite high , add more at this price, Get ready more cash and add more the lower it gets, BUT make sure you average lower and you do have reserve cash and dont sell out for at least a year or two.....or if u feel u are making a mistak, talk to your broker and set a stop loss at 7.50 ( just in case). But i dont do that cos i intend to hold it for long term, IF MBB sinks, bursa also sinks, and Ringgit also no value.

[NewInvestor123 tollebunsmith. what does lower index means?
02/08/2021 6:14 PM]
Bursa or klse has a some 30 something shares which it considers the heart of klse.
Maybank, petronas, public bank eetc and latest if i am not mistaken is DIY..
The set a number at a predetermined price and monitors it and if the sum of those shares price increases the index will increase, and if the total sum of prices drops, the index drops too, so it is a bench mark to see the performance of bursa.
SO when index drops , it means , most of the share price are dropping, and there is probably a major event, like now malaysian p[olitics is unstable or weak.
And it many other factors may contribute to share prices going up or down.
The above is just or ordinary people to understand, just a simple version.
Pls google and read up BEFORE you invest, and dont listen to any medicine man and tips , as you may lose ur money. Always consult your broker or remiser or consult a registered professional before making any financial decision."

That can add to the risk of capital outflows faced by these countries, given the rising chance that the Federal Reserve could tighten policy sooner amid growing inflation pressure.
All of these headwinds to full recovery in the region could prompt more countries to reconsider the effectiveness of imposing extended lockdowns, and speed up vaccination rollouts, a factor that would allow them to reopen the economy, say economists. Singapore, which plans to ease travel restrictions later this year when it has fully vaccinated about 80% of its population, could be a good case to follow.
“The critical factor is how long and how strictly do governments have to manage movement controls or social distancing to keep the public-health issue at bay,” said Steven Cochrane, chief APAC economist at Moody’s Analytics in Singapore."

BNM: Standardised Base Rate to be used as reference rate for retail floating-rate loans from August 2022
-A+A
KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 11): Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) today released the revised Reference Rate Framework that will take effect from Aug 1, 2022, under which the Standardised Base Rate will replace the Base Rate (BR) as the reference rate for new retail floating-rate loans.
The framework, introduced in 2015, establishes the BR as the reference rate for retail floating-rate loans in Malaysia. Reference rates are publicly accessible interest rates that are used by financial institutions as a basis for pricing loans, according to BNM in a statement today."

KUALA LUMPUR – Waiving the accrued interest payment on all individual and business loans will have significant long-term consequences for banks, especially when the interest income accounts for 80% of banks’ revenues, Bank Negara Malaysia said.
Governor Datuk Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus said the total loans for individual and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) eligible for the automatic opt-in moratorium amount to about RM1.4 trillion – or 73% of the total bank system's loans.
She said there are serious implications if the banks are to waive accrued interests, given their critical role in the economy.
“First, banks will pull back on lending to conserve their buffers, especially with higher credit losses still expected to emerge.
“Secondly, banks’ owned credit ratings may be downgraded to reflect weaker future earnings capacity, and this will make it more expensive for banks to raise capital funding and the higher costs will be passed on to borrowers,” she told a press conference on the “Economic and Financial Developments in Malaysia in Q2 2021” report released today.
Thirdly, she said confidence in banks will be affected, which could trigger liquidity stress, and depositors may have concern for the safety of their deposits. This will also jeopardise depositors’ interests when bank earnings are adversely affected.
Fourthly, banks will not be able to pay dividends to their retail investors and institutional funds that hold public savings, such as the Employees Provident Fund, Retirement Fund (Incorporated), Permodalan Nasional Bhd, Armed Forces Fund Board, and Tabung Haji.
“This will result in lower returns to depositors and retirement savings. So when you take all these together, this would significantly hurt economic recovery and have longer-term implications for the economy and financial system.
“It is very critical that banks remain sound as this is what will enable them to provide the extensive repayment assistance that borrowers need at this time. To our knowledge, the repayment assistance offered by Malaysian banks has been the most extensive compared with any country in terms of scale and scope,” she said.
It is also to be noted that there are about 18.4 million individual depositors in the country, of which 15% are above the retirement age of 60, and many depend on the interest to partly sustain themselves.
The governor said the central bank is doing its part in getting through these difficult times.
Nor Shamsiah said monetary policy will remain accommodative given ascendancies, the future monetary policy stances will remain guided by new information, and the bank will take into account the overall outlook of inflations and domestic growth and implement appropriate policies.
On repayment assistance, she assured that the banks will continue to assist those who need it, and borrowers just need to choose the help they need.
Among the avenues available for them to manage their debt obligations is the Credit Counselling and Debt Management Agency, which can help borrowers, especially those with multiple bank loans, to further extend their loan moratoriums.
SMEs can obtain concessionary loans to enable them to pivot or enhance their business operations and improve their prospects.
At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, a six-month blanket moratorium between April and September was announced benefitting both individuals and businesses affected by the pandemic.
Today, the central bank announced that the Malaysian economy grew by 16.1% in Q2 2021 year-on-year compared with -0.5% in the first quarter of the year, supported mainly by the improvement in domestic demand and continued robust exports performance.
This was against the -17.1% GDP growth recorded in the same period a year ago as it took the brunt of the lockdown measure as Covid-19 hit the country.

Individual or company loan from bank, where the money from? Part of it are saving or FD money that ppl save in bank. Bank collect loan interest from customer, then pay interest for FD and saving. If waive interest, then have to waive the customer saving also? If not, who want to putih putih give the saving interest to ppl? I think the bank shareholder won't agree to bare this big amount. So if waive the FD interest, what will happen? I think all the depositor will cash out the money to put in other investment like bond, fund, or even lousy asnb. All ppl go cash out, where the money from if the bank already loan out part of it before? So personally I think that is not a good move to waive all the interest. It will make more messy for the country."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000318.jsp?ftp=322","Aug 14, 2021 9:32 AM","tollebunsmith","kennethlkf : sit down and think one minute only. Answer all questions honestly.
A very simple story.
If u buy a house for 200k , u do not pay cash.
If u sell a house for 200k, u dont get cash,
If they pay you cash, u also dowan cash.
So where is all the money?
If u buy,, the bank just ask u to sign some a4 papers , which u can buy 400 pieces for RM10.
The same bank give the seller a small, printed form ( b4 size) to transfer the cheque into ur account, for simplicity assume it is the same bank ( in which case u dont even receive a cheque ), You dont touch any cash.
And the buyer pays about 4% per annum, and u the seller will receive about 1% for keeping just a digital record for the buyer and seller.
So if law says buyer dont have to pay interest, banks turn to the seller and say, sorry seller we cannot pay u intrest, so take ur money back. And if u insist to keep all the cash in another bank, the bankers are all angry, and they dowan to take ur money. They say if u want the bank to keep your cash, u pay me 3% intrest per annum for me to jaga your money. You get angry too, so u say it is unfair. Banker say ok, it is unfair? Ok.. banker from tomorrow say he will sleep and work in your house but he wont pay any money as it is unfair.
So u decide to take cash back to your house and keep the cash. So u worry about Nazeeb songlap ur money, so u hire security, which dont come cheap as they must be checked for corruption and work record and that is expensive, Only Nazeeb wants to work free for you. So u decide better hire good people and u need to spend 100k per year to safeguard your 200k.
Then u get a brilliant idea. You ask a few sellers. u help them to safe guard their cash and u want to charge 10k per month for the service,. THe sellers argue it is not fair to them u charge them a fee ( in other words intrest).
So , how now?
Pay or dont pay.
If sellers pay, then BNM Zeti comes to you house and say, u kena fine RM10 million for doing illegal deposit. You argue, u dint know, so want to make it legitimate. So Zeti , is ur friend decides to tolong you. She gives u a lesen and say the annual fee for the banking lesen is 100 mil a year renewable every year, just as PBB , AMBANK, Allianz, CIMB are allcharged as much.
You so happy, u nearly trip and fall from ur balcony. Lucky ur wife save you.
Then u sit down and cry, cos if u get the lesen also no use cos nobody want to pay any intrest.
Now nobody can buy any house unless they pay cash , as banks say they dowan ur intrest ( both buyers and sellers) cos banks all in into crypto and suddenly MBB Zam and PBB Teh both share same table as Warren Buffet as the two bankers are declared richest bankers in the world .
If u so keras dowan pay any intrest, bankers also dowan ur lousy intrest and dont want to do hire purchase/mortgage.
At first Finacial companies very very happy, until they learn they cannot charge intrest. So financial all in into ETH and DOGEn. They also dowan to see your face and the next month they sell ETH and drive felali. Even if u beg them to keep ur money, they want u to buy Safe deopsit box , and for that u have to pay 3% value as service fee . So you happy, banks happy, Mahia happy and every body happy cos no pay intrest.
So, u get my point? or dont you? ( Answer: yes!! yes.. i see I will be paying 3% instead of getting paid to keep my money in the bank as the bankers pusing and collect service fee more than paying intrest)
So, if this happens , Zafrul will be celebrated as the BEST guy in the whole world for abolishing intrest rate in Malaysia , and even Biden invites him to the white house to honour him. Warren Buffet begss to makan lunch with Zafrul and Warren also sponsers #bankerjagaBanker hashtag although Warren dont faham bahasa.
so, #abolishintrest gains traction
and Nazeeb warns of #becarefulwhatyouwishfor
And so ends the story, they lived happily ever after.

You have most RM 500k to buy MBB? Once u buy, u will not buy again... at most another 500k. You stop buying. I stopped buying big quantities long ago. I add 1k to 3k shares every few months ( if i have budget) and sometimes i buy other shares.
If epf sell so many shares, who do u think buys? Answer: Other big gov backed entities like Tabung Haji/Kwap.LTAT/ASN/ASB and other big funds(Unit trust only limitedly cos they wil focus on better returns on capital).
ALl the above funds pakat pakat and buy sell among themselves as only they can absorb the large quantities. SOmetimes foreign funds do nibble but mostly they dont care about MY stock as Singapore reits pay better dividend than MBB and RM dont drop/volatility as 4.02 t0 4.24 . Funds dont like unstable currency.
So major funds keep it low to get better DRIP ( in 2 weeks) qtr report and only push it up if they have political agenda to back up the lord if thye request so. Sometimes .....
SO if u think it is so lousy stock, then sell and put ur money in fixed depo. If cheap buy, if dont care, then dont buy dont sell. Easy fix. U can sleep easy , just sell.

Let me explain:
Stkoay claims he has 300k shares of PBB and 300k shares of MBB, Some people dont believe him. I told stkoay he need not prove it , and stkoays is being sarcastic like Anwar claims numbers but does not match.. stkoay can prove his ownership to us without revealing any private info in a simple way.
how? he palces sell order at 2.00 pm at the lowest price and he tell us the number before doing so.. that proves he really that many shares.I told him he needs not prove it to me as I believe him.
If u dont believe him, u can ask him to prove it.... cos I think he is not anwar kind of people, cos there is strength in his words."

Guan Eng urges banks to waive principal interest during six-month moratorium
Saturday, 28 Aug 2021 11:51 AM MYT
KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 28 — The banking industry should waive interest payments during the loan moratorium period since the second quarter of 2021 has indicated a reasonable profit margin for banks, said former finance minister Lim Guan Eng.
He said taking interest and profits from distressed borrowers is not really the “Keluarga Malaysia” or “Malaysian Family” way as advocated by newly-appointed Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob.
“The banking industry is expected to significantly improve on their profitability this year compared to 2019, as shown by Maybank’s net profit for the second quarter ended June 30, 2021, doubling to RM1.96 billion from RM941.73 million last year,” Lim said in a statement.
He added that Maybank recorded RM2.39 billion net profits in the first quarter of 2021, compared with RM2.05 billion last year."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800000318.jsp?ftp=330","Aug 29, 2021 11:15 AM","tollebunsmith","""There is a need for the winners of the Covid-19 pandemic and economic recession to help those who lost their jobs and businesses as well as struggling to find work or survive. One of the winners is the banking industry, whose profits continue to rise.
“The banking industry recorded after-tax profits of RM32.3 billion in 2019 and more than RM23 billion in 2020 despite the economic recession,” Lim said.
The Bagan MP asked how many companies will be in the same comfort zone as Maybank in enjoying better profits this year compared to last year.
“Whilst focus is placed on winning the battle against Covid-19 and saving lives, immediate attention must be given to saving livelihoods of countless Malaysians and businesses destroyed by the current economic recession.
“The current government must stop the double standards in enforcement, the policy flip-flops, the U-turns in SOPs and failures to vaccinate earlier, implement robust testing programme and mass screenings,” he said.
Lim said it is imperative that the lessons of the past must not be forgotten.
“Bloomberg placed Malaysia last out of 53 of the world’s largest economies surveyed for Bloomberg’s monthly Covid Resilience Ranking, in the country’s ability to provide some sense of normalcy amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Everyone knows what has gone wrong despite the imposition of serial movement control orders and the Emergency Proclamation,” he said."

“We are pleased to inform that through the meeting, we agreed to open the tourism sector in several destinations under the “travel bubble” programme based on the conditions set.

I started buying MBB only March this year after most stocks that I follow have rebounded sharply...and I only find value in MBB then, which is low beta, stable and gives one of highest dividend yield.
Recently, I have taken profit on some of the stocks I bought last year and switch the proceed to add MBB.
If you do home work and read their 5 years plan (Target to achieve EPS of more than 100 sen), MBB not only provide a good steady stream of dividend but also very good potential of high capital appreciation in the next few years.
As a long term value investor, MBB is now my No.1 holding."

Guess things have change due to the perhaps overly conservative stance by PBB. MBB definitely one to look out for.
I have narrowed down by portfolio and re-balance to concentrate more banking and utilities like Tenaga. Like MBB, Tenaga dividend policy is also quite attractive too. I am bullish on their prospects given their aggressive approach to meet the ESG goals. currently I am 1:4 ratio of MBB:Tenaga. I am thinking of rebalancing further to 1:2 when opportunity arises.

Option 1 - 28 cent full cash payment
Option 2 - 14 cent cash and 14 cent DRP to purchase new shares @ RM7.80 per share
If you have 1,000 shares then
Option 1 - You get RM 280 cash (before bank fees if any)
Option 2 - You get RM140 cash and 35/36 Maybank shares purchased at RM7.80 (can't remember the rounding).

@linges took that into account too. just sold my Tenaga at 10.28 and the net dividend loss after deducting trade profit is only ard RM390.00 (after brokerage) but the free up cash will allow me to 1) either enter MBB below 8.00 if possible or 2) explore buy back of Tenaga when it most probably fall below 10.00 after dividend to dollar cost my Tenaga which is about 10.05 now. Reason for consolidating is because MBB dividend is quite consistent for last couple of years around 50 sens region and while Tenaga fluctuates. Also the LHDN case against Tenaga is in the horizon. so yeh, the advantages to sell part Tenaga portfolio out weights the disadvantages at least for my case."

KUALA LUMPUR: The six largest Malaysian banks' non-performing loans (NPLs) will unlikely increase sharply despite the expected deterioration in banks' asset quality, according to Moody's.
In a report today, the credit rating agency said most of the repayment assistance scheme's applicants could have sufficient financial capacity to repay their debt when the programme ended.
""We expect most of the loans under repayment assistance will remain performing when the six-month measure expires,""it said.
""At AMMB Holdings Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd and RHB Bank Bhd, households whose income are at the top 20 per cent of the population account for more than half of retail loans under the scheme."""

My reasoning: according to The edge
At the time of writing, AMMB Holdings Bhd was leading the decline, shedding 4.31% to RM3.11. This was followed by RHB Bank Bhd (down 3.29% to RM5.29), Hong Leong Bank Bhd (declining 2.23% to RM18.36) and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (down 1.86% to RM4.75).
Meanwhile, Public Bank Bhd shed 1.48% to RM4, and Alliance Bank Malaysia Bhd slid 0.78% to RM2.54.
Public Bank had a below industry average of repayment assistance loans between 21% and 23%. compared to ind average at 32% to 34%, said UOB Research.
As for Maybank and RHB, the percentage of repayment assistance loans in their portfolio was around the industry average of 27% and 28%.
So why did PBB drop more than average? Funds pakat-pakat? push down to collect?

kennethlkf : sit down and think one minute only. Answer all questions honestly.
A very simple story.
If u buy a house for 200k , u do not pay cash.
If u sell a house for 200k, u dont get cash,
If they pay you cash, u also dowan cash.
So where is all the money?
If u buy,, the bank just ask u to sign some a4 papers , which u can buy 400 pieces for RM10.
The same bank give the seller a small, printed form ( b4 size) to transfer the cheque into ur account, for simplicity assume it is the same bank ( in which case u dont even receive a cheque ), You dont touch any cash.
And the buyer pays about 4% per annum, and u the seller will receive about 1% for keeping just a digital record for the buyer and seller.
So if law says buyer dont have to pay interest, banks turn to the seller and say, sorry seller we cannot pay u intrest, so take ur money back. And if u insist to keep all the cash in another bank, the bankers are all angry, and they dowan to take ur money. They say if u want the bank to keep your cash, u pay me 3% intrest per annum for me to jaga your money. You get angry too, so u say it is unfair. Banker say ok, it is unfair? Ok.. banker from tomorrow say he will sleep and work in your house but he wont pay any money as it is unfair.
So u decide to take cash back to your house and keep the cash. So u worry about Nazeeb songlap ur money, so u hire security, which dont come cheap as they must be checked for corruption and work record and that is expensive, Only Nazeeb wants to work free for you. So u decide better hire good people and u need to spend 100k per year to safeguard your 200k.
Then u get a brilliant idea. You ask a few sellers. u help them to safe guard their cash and u want to charge 10k per month for the service,. THe sellers argue it is not fair to them u charge them a fee ( in other words intrest).
So , how now?
Pay or dont pay.
If sellers pay, then BNM Zeti comes to you house and say, u kena fine RM10 million for doing illegal deposit. You argue, u dint know, so want to make it legitimate. So Zeti , is ur friend decides to tolong you. She gives u a lesen and say the annual fee for the banking lesen is 100 mil a year renewable every year, just as PBB , AMBANK, Allianz, CIMB are allcharged as much.
You so happy, u nearly trip and fall from ur balcony. Lucky ur wife save you.
Then u sit down and cry, cos if u get the lesen also no use cos nobody want to pay any intrest.
Now nobody can buy any house unless they pay cash , as banks say they dowan ur intrest ( both buyers and sellers) cos banks all in into crypto and suddenly MBB Zam and PBB Teh both share same table as Warren Buffet as the two bankers are declared richest bankers in the world .
If u so keras dowan pay any intrest, bankers also dowan ur lousy intrest and dont want to do hire purchase/mortgage.
At first Finacial companies very very happy, until they learn they cannot charge intrest. So financial all in into ETH and DOGEn. They also dowan to see your face and the next month they sell ETH and drive felali. Even if u beg them to keep ur money, they want u to buy Safe deopsit box , and for that u have to pay 3% value as service fee . So you happy, banks happy, Mahia happy and every body happy cos no pay intrest.
So, u get my point? or dont you? ( Answer: yes!! yes.. i see I will be paying 3% instead of getting paid to keep my money in the bank as the bankers pusing and collect service fee more than paying intrest)
So, if this happens , Zafrul will be celebrated as the BEST guy in the whole world for abolishing intrest rate in Malaysia , and even Biden invites him to the white house to honour him. Warren Buffet begss to makan lunch with Zafrul and Warren also sponsers #bankerjagaBanker hashtag although Warren dont faham bahasa.
so, #abolishintrest gains traction
and Nazeeb warns of #becarefulwhatyouwishfor
And so ends the story, they lived happily ever after.

Based on our calculations, the interest foregone for three months is less than 2.0 per cent of earnings. Even if we assume a higher loan moratorium take-up rate by the B50 segment, the maximum impact is more than 7.0 per cent,"" said Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd (HLIB) analyst Chan Jit Hoong.
Chan said the damage would still lesser compare to the first automatic loan moratorium last year, while banks' financial year 2021 (FY21) profit base could be larger mainly due to lower provisioning levels.
CGS-CIMB Research analyst Winson Ng estimated the impact from the interest exemption would be about RM1.42 billion, which could be regarded as a one-off item.
""This would lower banks' net profits by 5.0 per cent. However, the impact would be smallest for Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) at 3.9 per cent as only 61 per cent of its loans are in Malaysia."""

As China continues its “Common Prosperity” crackdowns, more outflows from the China/HK markets are likely to prevail in the near term and Bursa Malaysia is likely to remain as one of the beneficiaries due to its laggard status. With domestic institutional funds remain net sellers (-RM2.76bn since end July), further external inflows may stimulate the local institutional funds to play catch up. For investors that missed out on the “mini Aug rally” (+7.1% MoM), we reckon the current market weakness could be the next boat to catch on the broader re-opening theme play.

If you ask me, I think the share will trade above 10 is a year or two and above 12 in 2 to 3 years.
Management has a guidance of above 100 sen EPS in their 5 years plan, if they can achieve that, then 12 means a PE of less than 12 times, which is very cheap for the No.1 blue chip.
And while waiting for them to grow the profit, you still get a dividen of about 7%....mana mau cari :)

KUALA LUMPUR (Sept 22): The government is contemplating and studying the implementation of a one-off higher tax rate to be imposed on companies that have generated extraordinary profits during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Deputy Finance Minister II Yamani Hafez Musa, who was speaking in Parliament today, added that Putrajaya is also studying the implementation of a capital gains tax, which was proposed by several Members of Parliament (MPs) during the latest parliamentary sitting as part of efforts to replenish government funds spent on combating the Covid-19 pandemic.
“The government is looking at a few ways in which it can increase its revenue, including implementing the taxing of capital gains on shares and also imposing a one-off higher tax rate on companies that have obtained extraordinary profits during the pandemic,” he said during his winding-up speech on the King's address today.

KUALA LUMPUR (Sept 23): Fitch Ratings has affirmed Malayan Banking Bhd’s (Maybank) long-term issuer default ratings (IDR) at BBB+ and its viability ratings at bbb+, with a stable outlook.
“The affirmation of Maybank's ratings reflects the strength of its stand-alone credit profile, which drives its IDR. The Viability Rating is underpinned by Maybank's market-leading franchise in Malaysia, consistent business execution and stable financial performance.
The agency said it also revised the outlook on asset quality and on earnings and profitability to stable from negative, as it sees tail risks of more severe scenarios have abated, and there is adequate headroom within the current scores to withstand the deterioration it expects from lingering economic challenges.
It added that Maybank's government-linked shareholders have also demonstrated their willingness over the years to reinvest dividends and support the bank's capitalisation, should it become necessary."

KUALA LUMPUR (Sept 23): Noting that the downside systemic risks for Malaysian banks are on the rise, S&P Global Ratings today affirmed its A- long-term and A-2 short-term issuer credit ratings on CIMB Bank Bhd, Malayan Banking Bhd and Public Bank Bhd.
The rating agency also affirmed its BBB+ long-term and A-2 short-term issuer credit rating on AmBank (M) Bhd and RHB Bank Bhd.
“The outlook on all the five Malaysian banks is negative,” S&P said in a statement.
“In our view, downside systemic risks for Malaysian banks are on the rise. We consider that the economic risk trend for Malaysia has turned negative,” it said.
S&P said Malaysian banks are also facing rising risk in the competitive environment due to negative government intervention.
“We now see a one-in-three possibility that Malaysian banks could underperform our base-case asset quality expectations in the next 12-24 months.
“The protracted lockdown, rampant pandemic waves, repeated moratoriums on loan repayment, and ongoing political uncertainties in Malaysia have increased the downside risk to the recovery of the country's banking system.
“These factors have also reduced the headroom in our ratings on Malaysian banks,” it added.
Meanwhile, the rating agency also forecast the Malaysian banking industry's nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio to reach 3% to 4% and credit costs to stay at 55-60 basis points (bps) annually over 2021 and 2022, before recovering gradually.
It expects the country's gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by 6% in 2022, and the unemployment rate to improve to 4.4%.
According to S&P, Malaysian banks are facing Covid-19 related credit challenges from a position of strength compared with most of their ASEAN peers.
The Malaysian banking sector's NPL ratio and credit costs were at historical lows of 1.5% and 8bps, respectively, prior to 2020, and banks in general have a good earnings buffer to absorb an unexpected rise in credit costs, it noted.
“We also see an increased risk of negative government intervention in the Malaysian banking industry.
“The risk is reflected in the repeated government intervention in relief measures given out by domestic banks such as the recent announcement to waive off fourth-quarter interest for B50 (bottom 50% of individual borrowers by income) customers,” said the rating agency.
Such interventions, it said, could recur given the ongoing political instability, and impede the banking sector's ability to operate commercially.
“Other examples of past government interventions include the two rounds of extensive, six-month automatically approved moratorium programmes for all retail and small and midsize enterprise customers (combined 75% of commercial banking system loans).
“These have hurt banks' profitability even as they battled asset quality stress during the current credit downturn. Those interventions could also encourage some borrowers to be less disciplined in their repayment behaviour,” it added.
Noting that the Malaysian banking industry's profitability was much weaker in 2020, S&P said this is likely to remain under heavy pressure during 2021 due to the interest waiver schemes and still elevated credit costs.
Meanwhile, the agency anticipates that the industry will maintain a healthy level of local currency deposits over the next 12-24 months, underpinned by dominant retail presence and strong consumer confidence, and Malaysia's high savings rate of about 30% of GDP.

I own MBB & PBB as anchor shares... 80% are invested in them. The other 20% is play money, invested in sure shot shares like FPI ( for short term only, u can read my prediction before price break) nd i usualy sell afetr 10-20% as i cant tahan losses.
Partially in other instruments like ASM, as i fear, fixed deposit, non-tradable non bursa dividend shares (4.5-8%), and a very smal percentage in US of late ( not significant).
I believe in diversity as I had lost 80% of my saving when i was made some bad decisions in my middle age. I have now gained all I lost and more.
I do not speculate or aim for big gains. ( example MBB 8.25 already achieved my target price for this yr.
I would sincerely advice you NOT to follow my style nor stkoay style as u know ur own limitation and commitments.
If u are young or middle aged or retired, different style is required. No one size fits all.

'... Maybank Dividend Reinvestment Plan
Maybank is one of the few companies in Malaysia and in my portfolio that consistently offers dividend reinvestment plans every year.
I’ve been opting to go for their DRP and receiving discounted stocks instead of receiving dividends in cash. Of course, you should do this only when the math makes sense.
It is simple math. You compare the issuing price to the share price today and deduct the cost of applying for the DRP – RM10 setem hasil and a RM3 handling fee for an online application.
DRPs don’t make sense when the share price has of the company has been dropping for the few months preceding the DRP. I’ll be using Maybank as an example and continue to update this article as I opt for dividend reinvestments.

If u want to hold for long term, DRIP is better, If short term, cash would be desirable as u might need the cash for a reason.
And if u own few hares, cash is better, but if u hold a lot, DRIP is better. Why?
Last DRIP was at 7.55 (2019) and 7.60 (2020) if i remember correctly. so u gain from more if u sell it at a now.
Anf by opting for DRIP u only incur a small sum (RM10+RM3) which u would otherwise pay RM80 for 1000 shares. ( Pls check with ur own remiser/dealer/broker.

Rule of law/justice seems and is flawed on matters \pretaining Hamidi and others 5. Zati/spouse case in Singapore
6. JPN Data leakage/hacked so possibility of other leaks from Gov entities. 7. MY2H sudden goal post shift which lead to many foreigners dislike and liquidating their holdings and Malaysia in bad light where investors feel unsafe on policy matters ( half baked ideas/changing policy on whims/ unthough thru policy). 8. Questionable big payments to external think tanks/unaccountability. 9. Crypto being classified as illegal 10. Draft proposal for Tax file number for easy tracking on foreign deals by normal individuals but high profiled / individual walk free and no action taken... future might be worse. 11.

Retain our OVERWEIGHT stance on the sector with our top BUYs on RHB Bank (fair value RM6.80/share), Maybank (FV RM9.90/share) and CIMB Group (FV RM5.80/share). We favour banks with expected improvement in regional performance from the gradual economic recovery and banks with undemanding valuations. The US Treasury yields have recently continued to rise with 9 members of the FOMC in favour of an earlier rate hike in 2022 in the recent Fed meeting as compared to 7 earlier. Pressure for rate hikes is expected to also spill over to emerging markets, including Malaysia.
Any increase in interest rates will be positive on banks’ interest income and margins."

Buy at ur own comfortable amount cos if u try to copy trade, u will suffer cos the guy u are copying might have deep pocket. Remember this rule, investement need time to mature, not overnight.
We small retail investors make 75% of the trades in bursa ( thats what i heard).
What am i saying? price is cheap.. might drop, buy a bit more, if it goes up, u made some capital growth. Real price is 8.28 for us long time holders, just for reference.. cos we will get the dividend of RM0.28 on Oct 21st."

right sifu.. u are in a different category, For me yes, if buy few lots can see change in my average price, but my average price is around here , so not going to make much difference. Thats why i have a little ""reserved money"" to buy if it drops a lot... it it doesnt drop also no problem as i have accumulated a satisfactory number of shares for the time being.
No one can predict what the market direction is at a future period, so i only have to do a ""what if"" scenario if market crashes.... and no one in this world can guarantee it wont happen, but it is always good to keep it in mind, so FI it did occur, u sources of income/cash are available.
Just a reminder , when people were flipping properties and were very glad they owned a few houses for fashflow, some of that same people lost their pants. Only the guru who guided them was very much wealthier than the investors. Now with half past politicians who cant even do anything right for the past 50 years , u believe they wont screw themselves up? Only sure thing is , songlap will be perfected by those monkeys, and sure to blame the penang guy if they pissed on their own legs.

KUALA LUMPUR (Oct 8): Banks have come up with a counter proposal to the government's interest waiver plan, and some banking sources say it has been submitted to the authorities.
However, bankers were tight-lipped when asked what the counter proposal entails. Most just referred The Edge to the Association of Banks (ABM) on the matter.
This is an “interesting” development, a banking analyst said on learning about the banks coming up with a counter proposal, adding this shows that banks are looking for middle ground."

I always thought they were a ploy by big fund managers to give artificial perception of strong support fighting for shares at said prices. so small retailers also queue for the price. and when these big boys suddenly pull out, the orders will be bought / sold by smaller retailers trapped at that price. thats one reason why shares prices have been back and forth for some counters including Tenaga. hence as you rightly noted, not a single trade done by big volume buy/sell orders.

A possible interest rate hike in Q1-Q2 2022 may translate into lower expected demand for lending. Therefore, less lending may cause less customers which in turn could exert pressure on bank earnings in the upcoming quarters. Banks earn profit with depository money and from lending activities and even though the margins will remain the same, the demand will certainly plummet with rate hikes in the horizon. Therefore, we are very bearish on financial sector except consumer lending companies.

""I would also like to clarify that in implementing the current moratorium, all banking institutions have taken various measures that help to further reduce the cost of credit, especially for the most affected borrowers, and go beyond the obligations set out in the original credit agreement,"" he said.
First, he said, all banks had agreed not to charge compound interest on interest or penalty interest on all product loans during the moratorium. While there will be no compound interest, the minister said regular interest (or accrued interest) will continue to be considered on the accrued loan balance.
This is because banks must continue to meet their obligations to pay interest to depositors, cover other funding costs, and allow banks to continue to offer credit to stimulate the economy, according to the minister.
""Second, credit card holders can request to convert the balance of their credit card loan to a term loan at lower financing rates.
""Thirdly, borrowers who apply for assistance through AKPK and are among the most affected, such as borrowers who have lost their source of income or households facing the situation of the death of a breadwinner, can receive a reduction in interest costs from banks as one of the loan restructuring assistance packages,"" Tengku Zafrul added."

You only buy and never sell these stocks.

All/most apps have built in calculator for general profit&loss; BUT every brokerage house have their terms and condition and also they type of accounts u have with them differs quite a bit. In most cirumstances ,
1% for buying and and 1% for selling serves its purpose. Cosider , just for discussion case, there is a RM10 saved for each transection, that make u RM100 in 10 trades a month. For example, buying 100 shares incurs a min brokerage of RM12, thus buying 100 shares for 10 days , ur fees is already RM120, and buying 10 trades in 1 day only incures a minimum RM12 plus overheads.
U frequent buyers may be well versed and may trade optimaly, but my explanation is for new commers.
But my aim is to educate him so he learns in the process and not just waiting to be spoon fed. Once he learns that there are differences in brokers and brokerage , he may make better informed decisions based on factors variable. This makes him 'smart"" on any future branch out he might venture into, eg. US stock. Singapore stock. or AUX HKSE.
Cash upfront has one of the cheapest rates,then t+2 trades and also intraday differs a lot.
I assume he knows ""zero"" , but if he well versed, no harm done in assuming he knew less. But it was the otherway round, our friend might suffer a bit,
Just sharing, so us small timers can help each other to trade better.

This is NOT how to make , but to show there are many variants in trade.

As usual, my personal opinion is to buy if there is a bargain, with partial quantity.
By doing this u can average down instead of just not able to buy cos u maxed out,
If you had bought 30% , u still have 70% to average.
As sifu stkoay said: impact will be there but sentiment is not based on logic.
And if u are a long term investor, u would not have sold even if it touched 9.50 nor 7.50.
All facts considered, there is no other investment which offers a good dividend with stability & solidity ( compare Serbudak lost 70% and AAX PN19/delisting? etc.)
You cant sell off MBB and put it into FD.
Nor is it comparable or dependable with properties at this time.
I still believe in diversity and dollar cost averaging , and timed buying.
Consider this a lesson on impulse buying & a good buying opportunity.
I cant be pushed down too long as EPF and ASN , TH and bumi funds depends on this divvy, in part.
Think long term, like 3-5 yrs.

sui? think again
KUALA LUMPUR (Sept 22): The government is contemplating and studying the implementation of a one-off higher tax rate to be imposed on companies that have generated extraordinary profits during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Deputy Finance Minister II Yamani Hafez Musa, who was speaking in Parliament today, added that Putrajaya is also studying the implementation of a capital gains tax, which was proposed by several Members of Parliament (MPs) during the latest parliamentary sitting as part of efforts to replenish government funds spent on combating the Covid-19 pandemic.
“The government is looking at a few ways in which it can increase its revenue, including implementing the taxing of capital gains on shares and also imposing a one-off higher tax rate on companies that have obtained extraordinary profits during the pandemic,” he said during his winding-up speech on the King's address today.

On the average impact to banks from the one-off imposition of “Cukai Makmur” (Prosperity Act) as announced in Budget 2022, the research firm said as it is only a one-time tax rate hike and it expects investors to eventually turn their attention to the improving fundamentals of banks (recovery plays) which will benefit from a stronger economic growth.
“We continue to see prospects of improving total income supported by a pick-up in loans growth and potential interest rate hikes benefiting banks’ net interest margins.
“Additionally, banks’ asset quality is anticipated to improve ahead, hence, requiring lower provisions,” it added.
We retain our overweight stance on the sector with our top buys on RHB Bank with a fair value (FV) of RM6.80 per share, Maybank (FV RM9.90/share) and CIMB Group (FV RM5.80/share)."

Dividend is determined by the fundamental of the company.
Capital appreciation is determined by market forces/trend.
I prefer low beta high dividend stocks because when the market is down and (if) it stays down for many many years I still get my dividend if the fundamental of the company is intact.
Fundamentals for banks are improving....market trend no body knows ( like my sifu tolle said...if you know, Warrent Buffet will pay you USD1m to have lunch with you).
If you own Maybank and you compound the dividend yields of 7-8% over many years it's still a VERY ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT RETURNS.

星期五的財政預算案，造成今馬股資金明顯外流，不少個股跌幅介於3%～5%
很多散戶看見自己的股票跌幅不斷擴大、達到停損的界線，就按照紀律停損出場，但這時高手們卻正在默默買進。。。。。。
觀察市場氣氛是高手們判斷市場行情的一個指標，當市場上一面倒的觀點是最危險的
散戶之所以在停損，而高手在買進，不管原因如何，可以確定的是——高手手上有多餘資金可以買進！
這代表著：高手不是滿手股票，所以有錢可以撿便宜貨，而散戶往往在股價處在高檔的那一刻投入所有資金，導致下跌的時候百分之百承擔了損失，之後更沒能力在下跌時加碼買進
通常的情況是：散戶才剛買進而已，就跌下來了
人云亦云是危險的，尤其市場上一面倒的觀點最危險，你必須把『市場從來不是多數人決定、而是少數人決定』這句話放在心裡！

The initiatives from the Budget 2022are mostly positive for the banking sector as various measures have been proposed to increase household income with jobs creation and more cash assistances. Businesses (mainly SMEs) will benefit with enhanced micro-lending facilities while receiving incentives for hiring employees from targeted groups. However, the one-off Prosperity Tax will hurt CY22Eearnings, by 5-14% within our coverage buthas a marginal impact to our TPs (refer to overleaf for further details). That said, there should still be an overall improvement from CY21 amidst better loans performance, asset quality and lower net impairments. However, the uncertainties behind NIMs leave us cautious as its correction could be quicker-than-expected. MAYBANK(OP; TP: RM10.55) is our Top Pick for dividend safety (6-7% yield) and RHBBANK (OP; TP: RM6.10) as a tactical pick for its potential participation in the digital banking space.

In his view, Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) will be the least affected as he estimated a 7% negative impact on the projected FY22 net profit for the bank.
He assumed that 39% of Maybank's FY22 pre-tax profit will be generated from the overseas market and hence not affected by Cukai Makmur.
However, he maintained his ""overweight"" call on banks given the potential rerating catalyst from his projected core net profit growth of 7.3% for FY22.
He also estimated banks’ loan loss provisioning for the third quarter (3QFY21) increased quarter-on-quarter but declined year-on-year (y-o-y), which was positive for banks’ y-o-y net profit growth in 3QFY21."

Analyst Reports Tuesday, 02 Nov 2021 8:51 AM MYT
KUALA LUMPUR: Cukai Makmur notwithstanding, analysts remain bullish on the banking sector as September banking system data continues to point towards an economic recovery.
In a note, Maybank Investment Bank Research said it remains positive on banks as the pace of contraction in working capital loan applications is slowing and looks set to turn the corner.
""With the gradual opening up of the economy, we expect loan growth to strengthen in the coming months and maintain our industry loan growth forecast of 3.8% (annualized 3.4% end-Sep 2021),"" it said.
It added that the one-off Cukai Makmur is expected to dampen banks' earnings in FY22 but a possible offset could be lower-than-expected provisions.
Meanwhile, RHB Research said the healthy uptick in system loans in September, which offsets the month-on-month contraction in August, points to a sequentially stronger loan growth for 3Q21, albeit modest.
It said net interest margin will likely be stable given the still-healthy CASA growth and unchanged policy rate while asset quality will remain steady due to the various relief assistance provided by banks.
""Banks remain the best proxy for the economic recovery and rate hike cycle, while the impact of the National People’s Wellbeing and Economic Recovery (Pemulih) moratorium is expected to be manageable, given the very targeted scope,"" said RHB, which maintained its ""overweight"" call.
The research firm noted that system loans in September rebounded 1% m-o-m, helped by the phased relaxation of lockdown measures.
The rebound was led by working capital loans, mortgages and loans for purchase of securities.
Reflecting the pick-up in economic activities, lending to the non-household segment rose 1.5% MoM, outpacing the 1.0% MoM increase in household loans, added the brokerage.
System loan applications on a three-month moving average basis was up 2.6% m-o-m after falling 6% m-o-m in August.
Applications from the household segment increased 5.2% m-o-m, while demand from the business segment dipped a modest 0.8% m-o-m.
On a monthly basis, the growth in loan applications was sustained at 12% m-o-m, boosted mainly by the household segment.
In other September data, system deposits grew 1.4% m-o-m although current account savings account (Casa) growth momentum continued to moderate to 11.3% year-on-year.
System GILs declined 5.1% m-o-m mainly due to a sharp drop in working capital GILs while construciton and auto GILs fells m-o-m. The system GIL ratio ticked down to 1.57%.
SME financing grew 0.6% m-o-m in August with a broad-based improvement across manufacturing, wholesale and retail and construction being the key drivers.

I always use clean money (fresh cash or reserved moneyiemergency fund. and replace it within a period by selling off my unwanted shares.
I seldom switch instantly counter A with counter B cos of this extra charge/overhead issue
When I buy Buy counter A share: 1.2% in overheads.
When I buy Sell counter A share: 1.2% in overheads.
When I buy Buy counter B share: 1.2% in overheads.
So this extra 3.6% is extra expense of owning this B share ( in MBB case is about 24 sen just to break even.
As price drop occurs, it effects both shares.
I prefer to buy B share if i see an oppurtunity immediatly , and hold A share for a while for it to bounce back like 1-2% and sell it at a better price to replace my reserve money.
This only applies to big volume purchases but is negligible if shares are about 1-2k.
Just my 2 sen view from the point of view of a small time investor.
Any differing opinion is much appreciated.
I"

Also, NIM has widened sequentially. However, loans growth remained weak and NPL ratio has continued to climb higher. That said, results were in line and thus, our forecasts were unchanged. We still like Maybank for its regional exposure and leadership position. Furthermore, it offers superior dividend yield. Besides, it is one of the least affected bank by “Makmur Tax” and its lower foreign shareholding level vs larger banks, makes it less susceptible to sell-off. Maintain BUY and GGM-TP of RM9.40, based on 1.22x FY22 P/B.

However, the one-off Prosperity Tax will hurt CY22Eearnings, by 5-14% within our coverage buthas a marginal impact to our TPs (refer to overleaf for further details).
MAYBANK(OP; TP: RM10.55) is our Top Pick for dividend safety (6-7% yield)

Author: HLInvest | Publish date: Mon, 1 Nov 2021, 10:52 AM
Both system loans and deposits growth picked up momentum to 2.9% and 4.7% respectively. Similarly, leading indicators and asset quality have improved. As for NIM, we see it coming under slight pressure premised on brewing deposit rivalry and limited scope for further CASA expansion. Despite largely positive developments, we expect knee-jerk reaction to share prices, no thanks to ‘Cukai Makmur’. We advocate to accumulate on weakness, especially if the pull back is close to 10%. Keep OVERWEIGHT; BUY ratings include: Maybank, Public, RHB, and Affin.
Sep-21’s loans growth picked up momentum to 2.9% YoY (Aug: +2.5%), led by the business (Biz) segment, which strengthened to 2.3% (Aug: +0.8%); this was primarily buoyed by working capital financing (+3.8%). However, household (HH) lending stays tepid at 3.2% (Aug: +3.4%) due to weak auto (-0.6%) and personal loans (-0.5%). For now, overall system loans growth continues to trend beneath our +3.0-3.5% full-year FY21 estimates but we expect this to further gain traction at the later part of the year, given economic reopening.
Leading indicators improved. Loan applications expanded 12.5% MoM on the back of stronger HH credit appetite (+31.8%) but Biz remained sluggish (-9.6%). Similarly, loans approval saw an improvement of 13.7%; this was fuelled by accommodative HH (+30.9%) but again Biz was lacklustre (-0.1%).
Deposits growth also gathered steam to 4.7% YoY (Aug: +3.7%) as FD contraction has narrowed (-1.7% vs Aug: -2.8%) while other deposits grown faster (+5.4% vs Aug: +1.5%). Overall, Sep-21’s loan-to-deposit ratio remained flattish MoM at 87% (near to Feb-18’s peak of 89%). We understand there is brewing deposit rivalry in the market.
Asset quality seems to have mended as gross impaired loans (GIL) ratio decreased 10bp MoM to 1.57%; this was aided by Biz, which declined 26bp while HH nudged up 1bp. Regardless, we expect GIL ratio to rise but would not be overly worried as banks have already made heavy pre-emptive provisioning in FY20 and we reckon credit risk has been adequately priced in by the market, looking at the elevated NCC assumption utilized for FY21 by both us and consensus (above the normalized run-rate but below FY20’s level). Moreover, the Government and BNM will remain supportive in helping troubled borrowers, limiting a significant deterioration in GIL ratio.
Interest spread widened. Average lending rate expanded 5bp MoM while the 3-mth board fixed deposit rate ticked up 1bp. As consequence, the spread widened by 4bp. Nevertheless, we expect net interest margin (NIM) to be under slight pressure given brewing deposit rivalry and limited scope for further CASA expansion.
Maintain OVERWEIGHT. We expect knee-jerk reaction to share prices due to ‘Cukai Makmur’; we estimate sector earnings impact is -10%. However, it is a one-off event and more importantly, Covid-19 woes are seen to fizzle out in 2022 while the state of the economy and banking sector will only get better in time. Moreover, valuations are still undemanding and there is ample liquidity in the market. As such, we advocate to accumulate on weakness, especially if share prices pull back by c.10%, similar to our ‘Cukai Makmur’ profit impact calculation. BUY ratings include: Maybank (TP: RM9.40), Public Bank (TP: RM4.50), RHB (TP: RM6.85), and Affin (TP: RM2.15).

This is broadly in line with its 5-year mean of 1.19x but ahead of sector’s 0.87x. The premium is warranted considering its regional exposure and leadership position. Also, it offers superior dividend yield of c.7% (3ppt higher vs peers). Besides, it is one of the least affected bank by “Makmur Tax” and its lower foreign shareholding vs larger banks, makes it less susceptible to sell-off.

I dont want to bore u , but i repeat: I only buy and never sell MBB 75-85% of my investment in bursa.
These MBB is insurance money. Theose stocks might give u fantastic dividend, BUT are they real? compare SCIB, Sumatec , AMbank etc. If u want to gamble, Genting casino can double it in one go, but there is no gurantee. & 50-50 chance but MBB gives better averages.
With MBB , history showed it is for senior non -gambling owners.
One bird in hand is worth many times more than 2 or 10 birds in the bush.
If gamble, take 10-30 % and sailang, so even if delisteda;so , u are on strong ground.
As i have said before, i will add MBB in January and leverage on dollar cost averaging.. even if price drops or price increases.
I take long term view on MBB/PBB and other assets (3-5yrs).. remember KWSP/KPAP/ASN all hold this share and only give 4-6%.. so getting more % and with economy improving ,
MBB is a safe bet.
* my personal opinion. ( I am divrsified and do hold multiple investment catagory and refuse to hold speculate which makes me sleepless. Low risk , lower gain, i am ok with it and I am not greedy.
Else why is that singh still here when he said he was leaving??.... cos MBB is a gem... In fact if RM7.00 i will sell other assets to topup MBBPBB/ABC/XYZ.

1) Banks have been told to give loan moratorium to both Real Estate and car payments for more than 6 months
Lots of these will turn into delinquent loans later and Banks NPL (Non performing loans will go up)
2) 70% of SMEs already scaled down or close shop during the Covid 19 lock down. This will cause more NPL and less borrowing from Banks. With less loans Banks bottom line will erode further
3) Govt also tell Banks to waive interest charges for B40. This will bleed more cash
4) Banks also face very low interest spread at 1.75% interest rate. So earnings will shrink
5) In Iskandar due to over building Rm30 Billions worth of High Rise Condos might turn into Ghost Tower with drastic change in MM2H. This will blow a Huge Hole in Banks capital when all turned into subprime non performing loads
Instead of overweight should down grade banks to UNDERWEIGHT

The rest queue at lower price, so if u get it it is a bonus and ur average price gets lower. If the price goes up, u are also happy cos u have the desired amount of holding of shares. So, u get lower also you happy,the best of both worlds, Price go south=happy , price goes up=happy.
When it was 8.30 nobody expected it to go to 8.00.
So , those who had cash , can easily load up now at 8.00
Who knows, if it goes lower?, then i sapu also... only my cash come in January end, I designed it in such a way, i get cash comming in twice a year, so if good oppurtunity, i can do dollar cost averaging.
And i know most of u guys only buy, never sell, just like me.
So, price volatility is not a problem for me and to sifu stkoay andf the other sifus.
Only , lots of people talk kosong and use dupe (use different names) and try to make themselves popular by talking nonsense.
Pls ask urselves, if they hate this MBB, why are they here? for what? talk xxxx.
I dont actually give attentions to these losers, only respect sifu stkoay and a few more.
Only sifu stkoay will show is holdings. No talker can do what sifu stkoay can prove,
DONT BELIEVE , supersinginvestor he deletes his msg and is a snake.
And all those who share his hatred are his duplicates.
I never asked anyone to follow me , just my opinion and my stretegy.
Why, so we small investors can prosper.
if u have any good suggestions, i am very happy to follow and together we huat.
But others out of jealously , will try to make u lose money. Why , cos they dont hold no shares or just a few loose ones.

Actually major shareholders selling or buying does not really effect the shares much as they tend to trend higher or lower as the market perceive on economic factors. As i have said before ( and it does happens in a gov backed entity) the shares change hands among themselves as to give it volume and it also gives it an aura of a vibrant & actively stock. This makes foreign /local fund to pick some of it up.
They got this idea of inter trading with different names form the very best of mara dropouts where they award projects among themselves and er marked it as ""direct award"" and priced higher so that
chosen majority reap big profits.
That analysis was actually directed to those people who was so fixated with epf/kpap/tb buy sell and make off the cuff remarks without doing any homework as they learn from historical price movements.
I have done a study too but it was some years back.

Without any fresh catalyst and ahead of the upcoming Sawarak elections on 18 Dec, KLCI is expected to establish a base near 1500-1515 levels in the near term. That said, in anticipation of Dec window-dressing activities, coupled with aggressive economic reopening activities and a high vaccination rate, KLCI may grind higher to refill the 1545- 1560 gap in December. With the finding that 18 out of 21 times (2000-2020) KLCI registered a positive return in December, we suggest investors accumulate high potential window-dressed companies such as TM (BUY-TP RM7.93), KLK (BUY-TP RM25.62), MAYBANK (BUY-TP RM9.40) and PCHEM (BUY-TP RM10.90).

YES! We are witnessing erratic weather.
Cold weather will be felt much colder than before.
Stock market crash has already begun.
Expect the dollar to rise more till middle of next year 2022.
Unprecedented inflation will be seen
Real estate will be hit hard.
Bitcoin is crashing and may find support around US$44500, however it is weak support. USD18500-18700 is a nice entry for a pullback.
Political front is still murky and the nation is in auto pilot.
Dimwitted politicians have gambled away the nation and pawned it's people.
Life will not be as easy as before even with BN or UMNO ruling.
There are no good leaders, only good racist pirates.

Now, if we compare the tangible book value of RHB and Maybank, it is RM 5.95 for the former, and RM6.6 for the latter. In that sense, I believe RHB is undervalued compared to Maybank. But then, given Maybank's dominant position in the Malaysian banking landscape, I suppose investors feel Maybank (average PER 12.5) is a safer bet than RHB (average PER 10.5)."

Government Shutdown 2021: Will SNAP Benefits for December Be Paid Without Debt Ceiling Extension?
Josephine Nesbit

Congress is running out of time to avoid a government shutdown. Lawmakers have until the Dec. 3 deadline to raise the debt ceiling before the U.S. defaults on its debt (although the estimate has recently been revised to Dec. 15 by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen). Many are questioning whether a government shutdown will impact December federal benefits, especially those who depend on payments to pay bills, buy food and other necessities, and secure healthcare."

""In my view maybe this new variant is the light at the end of the tunnel.""
Granot argued that pandemics don't normally end due entirely to an effective vaccine. Rather, he said, ""herd immunity"" is often achieved when the virus ultimately mutates to become highly infectious but minimally aggressive and then the virus will just fade away.""
""The way that it will end, at least in my view, is when we encounter this new variant that is highly infectious but is not very aggressive. He noted that such a revelation would not be surprising since respiratory viruses like the coronavirus generally fizzle out by evolving to ""be less and less aggressive. We have a lot of experience with viruses like the flu,"" Granot said."

Stocks are expected to remain volatile in the coming week, as investors focus on developments related to the Covid omicron variant and weigh the Federal Reserve’s next steps for dialing back its bond-buying program.
This past week Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank could discuss speeding up its bond-buying taper. This could move up the Fed’s timeline for raising interest rates.

Yes, similar prediction here.
4Q21 EPS will probably be around 15 to 18 sen.
Final dividend will probably be around 28 to 30 sen, 32 sen is still a possibility.
As my sifu tolle correctly said...if you can correctly predict future share price, then Warrent Buffet will pay USD 1M to have lunch with you.
Since no one can predict, one of the best strategy is to buy strong fundamental VALUE stock....one with lower PE, lower PB (price to book) and gives higher dividend.
With the current uncertain market, IF the market were to trade lower and stays there for long time, you still get your roughly 7% dividend while waiting for market to recover.

9M earning shown in EPS is 52.42, an increase of 19% YOY compared to last year (43.98). Just short of 5 sen if compared to FY2020 of 57.66. 4Q sure can achieve EPS above 5 sen (my estimation is about 15-18 sen), if there is the case, this year's div shouldn't be lower than last year (Last year 52 sen). I guess the final div should be around 28-30 sen. Let's see."

for current trend I observe that for Tenaga and Maybank I feel that big boyz are shaking the mango tree. they will pick off those fruits that fell from the tree, thats why you see the back and forth going on daily.
the trend I noticed for both (more so for MBB) is that every morning it goes up a little to trap anchovies, than mid afternoon the selling pressure comes on, presumably FF starts work that time. than miraculously the stock price will shoot back up during closing. we have all seen this move before and we can call it window dressing or naught, that's the current pattern that I foresee will carry on at least until just before Xmas where the price will fall in view of Western Countries taking a long period of holidays.

My opinion is still :
1. Buy staggered .. if cheaper buy more , price high buy a bit. ( dollar cost averaging). Price can and will shoot up (20-40 sen) once economic growth is confirmed.
3.Negative views due to penyu usually wrong choice & misdirected policy ( mara etc) wont be great for MBB ( as reminded by Nazir recently).
4. As gov has tasted cukai makmur/tax they will not let it go easily else not much money to songlap
5.My very conservative estimate of years high is around 8.25-8.40
6. No better buy than MBB , so not much you can lose although the odds are stacked against MBB,
when compared to fixed price/epf/mutual funds/property and other safe investments
* disclaimer .. some investments might get u better returns, but it is just being lucky with some negative returns..
In conclusion, i can sleep comfortable and expect a decent dividend as I have decided to retire and dont want to risk any big losses. With MBB & PBB i can live comfortably and dont have to worry about price swings and limits downs ( read Serbuk, SCId etc.
Salut numba1 and numba2 and sifu Stkoay for your insights and knowledge and you proven successful strategy of buying MBB and thus gives us confidence to ""buy and never sell"" attitude.

Again, my emphasis is on good quality companies backed by earnings instead of those solely based on “promised prospects”. For a fundamentalist investor, such market is the best time to capitalise on the opportunities.
Timing the market is also another area where many retail investors try to do but fail miserably.
It is very difficult to catch the bottom even if one is a world class economist.
Warren Buffet once said: “The real fortunes in this country have been made by people who have been right about the business they invested in, and not right about the timing of the stock market.”
So leave the market timing endeavours to the fund managers and professional traders, focus on playing to your advantage as a retail investor; which is to buy and hold good quality companies while letting time to work for you.

I Dont mind sharing. But first let me qualify it stating that ur holdings should vary with ur age and reason and what is ur objective.
Let me also declare that when i was in my 30ties i lost 10 yrs of my earnings ( everything which was invested in stock).
I am thankful for the lessong learned and have used that failure to earn more than 10 times what i lost.
I always advocate dollar cost avaraging, buy more when the price is lower and add a little if it is high.
Never buy ""all in"" no matter what a fantastic bargain u feel about that big price drop.
As my target is to get a stable dividend and a little of growth shares, my scale is 30% PBB : 60% MBB and 10% in reits/others ( in terms of value ).
Pls do understand due to my losses when i was young , i promised myself never to rely on one single source , but diversified. Why? cos at my age now i cant afford big losses and I do have friends who were rich but due to downturn , they are literally begging their children as dumping their investment ( eg properties will result in more losses )
YMSV ,Your Mileage should vary and I do suggest a start with ""adding"" when u have more funds and if u feel the prices of blue chips are at the lower end ( pls refer to sifu stkoay analysis, as he is usually more spot on on trends).
But do understand if u invest in blue chips the growth is only 6-10% and lose about 10% in share price.
Penny stock , growth is -100% to 1000% in a matter of months and so will ur losses also.
Betting in casino, u will get 100x in a matter of hours or lose only the money you began with.
So what is ur risk appetite and what is ur motive is a better guide, only u can give the best answer as following blindly will result in unexpected endings.
And i will end with this disclaimer: do ur own due deligence and i have forwarded my opinion and i am NOT a financial adviser.
And a warning about Calvintaneng and supersinginvestor who only lies and are unreliable."

Since this is an interesting discussion, may i seek your views on my counters i.e Mbb-34%, Pbb-17%, Tnb-22%, Utp-22%, carlsb-3% & takaful-2%. would you change ratios? Are malaysian REITS stable?"

Your investment pattern is one who is going to retire/retired who is aged around 55-65.
It is a stable mix of growth and dividend.
I personally would tweek MBB more weightage. perhaps around 50-70% when price is low ( if possible use fresh money) Sell off part of TNB when price is high (to replace ur fresh fund used to purchase MBB).
Learn this term : Dollar cost averaging.
Pls note : You cant trade the blue chips and cant be watching the screen and do nothing. So for excitement , it would be nice to buy and sell some volatile shares with a little play money ( just for fun) for short term.
Reits: I am expecting a run up as soon as banks go on recovery mode and economy picks up as people tend to do purchses with physical items for the ""feel good"" after the pandemic and expect malls uptrend as most investors are not buying in. I expect a decent divided in future ( 2-3 yrs period).
As i like ur diversified shareholdings so ur shareholding strength is stable and not easily affected.
Do expect other views to differ as we gain strength by sharing and seeing other point of views."

Omicron threat is still looming, and therefore investors should still be prepared for any negative tailwind. Global macro says buy financials. But you should hedge by buying a small portion of tech stocks to complement with defensive such as financials and cyclicals."

Mine is heavy on low beta, high dividend stock ie MBB.
As a value investor, I sold off all my stocks in 2014, when the index was trading around 1800+ points.
I came back last year to buy CIMB, Mahsing, RHB and late last year added Genting...(looking for capital gain)
This year, I took profit on some after they rebounded and switched to MBB (looking for dividend).
Now, I am heavy on MBB with some CIMB, RHB and small number of Genting.
I do not have PBB.
I choose MBB over PBB because it is trading at lower PE and lower P/B and yields higher dividend (again there is no right or wrong...up to individual preference)
As a long term value investor, I feel MBB offers very good dividend yield and decent capital appreciation prospect with their M25 plan
