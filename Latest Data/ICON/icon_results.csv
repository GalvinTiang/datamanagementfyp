"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800003587.jsp?ftp=106","Mar 19, 2019 2:51 PM","commonsense","Investors that are hoping for a turnaround of this company result might be better off looking elsewhere. Even though the O&G industry in general has started to turnaround, the same could not be said to the OSV industry. Given the still oversupply environment of vessels, it is highly unlikely that the charter rate and utilisation rate will improve that much which will only means further depressing financials for companies like Icon.
As of Dec 18, the total shareholders equity was a mere RM66.2mil which represent only 7.4% of its paid-up capital. Icon should have actually been already classified as a PN17 company as the shareholder’s equity is way below the 25% threshold level. Not sure why this is not the case.
If you are looking to hedge your portfolio outside of Icon Offshore (due to its weak earnings outlook and risk of being classified as PN17), I would recommend you to look at MBMR. (https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/stk/pt/5983.jsp)
MBMR is a direct proxy to Perodua via its 22.6% interest in the company. Valuation is cheap at only 6.6x PE based on FY18 profit of RM166mil. PB is low at only 0.7x BV.
FY19 should deliver another profit growth year to the company. Profit growth will again be driven by the performance of Perodua (via MBMR 22.6% holdings in Perodua) from the still strong sales of new Myvi, sales of SUV Aruz and the introduction of the newly revamp Alza sometime in the 2H19. Aruz which commands a higher margin compared to other models, will help improve the total profit margin of Perodua (which will flow to MBMR’s bottom line as well).
MBMR is expected to achieve a profit of RM200mil in 2019. At the current share price, the company is being valued at only 5.5x which is a lot lower than the industry average of 15x PE. As an example, UMW (another company with exposure to Perodua) is currently trading at a PE multiple of almost 20x.
Good luck."

U stands for Upstream business, M stand for Middle Stream business and D stand for Down Stream business. So basically my portfolio covers the whole value chain from Exploration in the upstream to distribution in the down stream business..
ICON has good backing from shareholders. So it's quite a safe bet.
What I do is to categorize my portfolio into 3 categories to priorities my engagements:
1. Buy and Engage - short to mid term
2. Buy and Hold - mid to long term
3. Buy and Forget - long term
ICON is under Category 3.
Lastly but not least, it's dirt cheap to capitalize on O&G Rally...

THE COMPANY DID THIS EXERCISE BY MERGING LAFARGE 10 INTO 3 WITH A CASH PAYOUT OF 20 SEN
SO 66 x 10 = RM6.60
6.60 - 20 sen = RM6.40
RM6.40 divided by 3 = RM2.13

The Edge Malaysia

This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on November 11, 2019 - November 17, 2019.
-A+A
LAST Friday, offshore support vessel (OSV) player Icon Offshore Bhd closed at 3.5 sen — the lowest level seen since it debuted on Bursa Malaysia 5½ years ago — for 10 out of the last 15 trading days.
At 3.5 sen, Icon’s shares are now worth less than 2% of its initial public offering (IPO) price of RM1.85. The company presents a knotty challenge for its major shareholder, Ekuiti Nasional Bhd (Ekuinas).
For a private equity (PE) fund such as Ekuinas, a full exit from Icon has been overdue for several years. It previously told The Edge that its exit horizon is typically three to five years — this month marks the seventh year since its investment clock on Icon began.

A PE fund typically does not hold an investment beyond its exit horizon. Ekuinas calculates its investment performance based on internal rate of return, which declines the longer an investment is held on to.
Icon has been loss-making for four out of the past six full financial years. It is also undertaking a cash call that will see Ekuinas pump a further RM183 million into the company, on top of the RM435.9 million already invested since 2012.
When asked on its exit strategy for Icon, Ekuinas tells The Edge that it is important to recognise the turbulent oil and gas environment since 2014 as crude oil prices plunged from record highs.
“Icon has been focused on maintaining capital discipline and productivity improvements. The strategy continues to be so moving forward,” says Ekuinas.
“The focus for Icon Offshore is to strengthen its balance sheet as it will enable the company to capitalise on the industry recovery and be on the path to profitability. As an investor and board representative, we continue to support Icon,” it adds.
To be fair, the announcement of the proposed rights issue in August also contributed to the counter tumbling to record lows.
To recap, Icon proposed to consolidate its outstanding shares by a factor of 50 to 1 while issuing rights on a 60-to-1 basis with free warrants. It seeks to raise up to RM250 million. Ekuinas has already committed to subscribe for the exercise for RM183 million.
The proceeds will be used to restructure RM577.1 million of Icon’s RM650.51 million debt. If successful, it expects total debt to reduce by 36% to RM412.99 million. Part of the restructuring involves issuing new shares plus free detachable warrants worth RM172 million to one creditor as settlement.
The exercises are part of its Corporate Debt Restructuring Committee (CDRC) scheme that aims to reduce gearing from 9.16 times to 1.14 times.
On Nov 8, the company said shareholders will vote on the proposal in an extraordinary general meeting scheduled for Nov 26.
Ekuinas is Icon’s single largest shareholder with a 42.28% stake, held via Hallmark Odyssey Sdn Bhd. Other shareholders include Minister of Finance Inc vehicle, Urusharta Jamaah Sdn Bhd, with an 8.8% stake and the Employees Provident Fund with 4.01%.
While it has invested RM435.9 million in Icon since 2012 and will put in another RM183 million via the rights issue, Ekuinas did recoup some of its investment via the IPO back in June 2014.
For the IPO, Ekuinas sold a total of 283.02 million shares. At the IPO price of RM1.85, the gross proceeds to the fund would have been RM523.6 million.
Back in January 2017, the PE fund, which ultimately reports to the government, did try to inject its Icon stake into a proposed tripartite merger that included another investment called Orkim Sdn Bhd and what was then UMW Oil & Gas Bhd (UMWOG).
Ekuinas owns 95.5% in Orkim, which ships clean petroleum products. UMWOG has since been renamed Velesto Energy Bhd.
The proposal had aimed to create an integrated offshore service provider with exposure to both upstream and downstream businesses. However, it fell through in May 2017 as the stakeholders found that the expected merger benefits fell short of expectations.
It is worth noting that the proposed merger had valued Icon at 50 sen per share or RM588.6 million. A successful merger would have enabled Ekuinas to reset its investment clock for Icon.
At its close of 3.5 sen last Friday, Icon was worth RM41 million in market capitalisation.
The valuation belies its position as among the largest OSV players in Southeast Asia in terms of fleet size, according to its annual report. It had 32 vessels across six types as at Dec 31 last year, of which 19 were anchor handling tug supply vessels. According to Maybank Investment Bank Research, the average vessel age is 10 years.
Part 1."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800003587.jsp?ftp=111","Nov 20, 2019 1:15 PM","xox9989","In the six-month period to June 30 (1HFY2019), Icon reported a net loss of RM11.45 million (1HFY2018: RM13.3 million net loss) on revenue of RM91.91 million (1HFY2018: RM101.24 million). The company attributed the performance to a higher number of vessels in drydocking, leading to lower utilisation.
In FY2018, Icon recorded a net loss of RM449 million on revenue of RM199.7 million, its biggest full-year loss amid record low revenue.
Of the total FY2018 net loss, RM419.9 million was from a non-cash net impairment of its fleet’s net book value. Its annual report states that the impairment was recognised as oil and gas market conditions had remained difficult.
According to Icon, the impairment was determined after an independent valuation process that considered the fair market value of its vessels less the cost to sell them, which was set at 1% of vessel value.
“The recoverable amount of vessels determined based on fair value less cost of disposal is RM208,260,360, which is RM379,073,334 lower than their carrying amount of RM587,333,694,” Icon says in its annual report.
That said, in a Sept 3 report, Maybank IB Research noted that Icon was operationally in the black but was hit by higher-than-expected taxes. At the time, Icon was trading at around five sen.
“Excluding the impact of the deferred taxes, Icon registered a core pre-tax profit of RM5 million in 2Q2019 after six consecutive quarterly losses on improved OSV utilisation,” says Maybank.
“Coupled with an improving operating outlook, the recent weakness in share price post its restructuring plan is an opportunity to buy. Hence, we upgrade Icon to a ‘buy’, on an unchanged target price of 8.5 sen.”
In August, Icon named Datuk Seri Hadian Hashim as its new managing director, effective Sept 3.
Hadian was the founder of Sona Petroleum Bhd, a special-purpose acquisition company that was ultimately unsuccessful. It will be interesting to watch how Icon performs with his appointment.

surged on Friday after the company secured RM275mil oil and gas contracts.
The counter surged 21.74%, or 2.5 sen to 14 sen. It is the second most actively traded counter saw 29 million shares done.
Icon Offshore has bagged contracts valued at RM275mil from oil and gas (O&G) companies to provide offshore support vessels (OSVs) for their production operations in Malaysian waters.
Icon said the contracts were clinched via its wholly-owned subsidiary Icon Offshore Group Sdn Bhd (IOGSB).
The long term contracts are for a primary period of three years, with an extension option of up to two years of one year each, it added.
Icon Offshore said the options would only be exercised at the end of the firm period, upon approvals obtained from Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd and the O&G companies.
It expects these contracts to contribute positively to the group’s earnings, order book and net assets for the financial year ending December 31, 2018 and beyond.

I think the massive rights issue will be under subscribed due to 400%+ extra funds needed to be pumped in...thus for anyone who wanna bet on Icon may find it cheaper to buy OR then

In a rights offering, each shareholder receives the right to purchase a pro-rata allocation of additional shares at a specific price and within a specific period (usually 16 to 30 days). Hence we need to see what will be offered to us.
Shareholders are not obligated to exercise this right.
Cash-strapped companies can turn to rights issues to raise money when they really need it."

Sometimes, rights offerings present disadvantages to the issuing company and existing shareholders. Shareholders may disapprove because of their concern with dilution. The offering may result in more concentrated investor positions. The issuing company, in an attempt to raise capital, may find that additional required filings and procedures associated with the rights offering are too costly and time-consuming; the costs of the rights offering may outweigh the benefits (cost-benefit principle).
So if it is not good we can oppose this RI Offering"

The rights issued to a shareholder have value, thus compensating current shareholders for the future dilution of their existing shares' value. Dilution occurs because a rights offering spreads a company’s net profit over a larger number of shares. Thus, the company’s earnings per share, or EPS, decreases as the allocated earnings result in share dilution."

Icon reported a core net loss of MYR2.7m, which was skewed mainly by higher taxes of MYR6m (138% effective tax rate) due to under provision of tax at one of its subsidiaries (MYR3m) in prior years. That took its 1H19 core loss to MYR11m, which was worse than our FY loss estimate of MYR3m for FY19. Excluding the impact of the deferred taxes, Icon registered a core pretax profit of MYR5m in 2Q19 after six consecutive quarterly losses on improved OSV utilization (50%; +4% QoQ)."

We remain positive on Icon’s recent debt restructuring proposal to recapitalise its balance sheet. While the planned restructuring exercise will result in a massive enlarged share base (+110%), its proforma net debt will also de-gear substantially to 1.1x (from 10x now), which will result in MYR18m p.a. savings in interest expense. The recent weakness in share price (-41%) post the exercise (unveiled 10 days ago) has priced in the dilution risk, in our view. With its OSV operations turning around, a successful implementation of this deal is a re-rating catalyst. An uptick in DCR is another catalyst, which we opine will materialise soon following a similar recovery in the offshore drilling space."

 One of Malaysia’s largest OSV providers; dominant in AHTS and AWB with a relatively young fleet (7 years).
 Vessels are Malaysia-flagged and will be able to capitalise on the stringent Malaysian cabotage rules.
 Icon is going through a challenging macro environment, as it faces bottoming of DCR but gradual recovery of OSV utilisation.
 Returns outlook is improving but the pace of recovery will be gradual, backed by its continuous efforts to optimise costs and OSV utilisation.
 M&A action is a key catalyst to unlocking values."

Current price has been factored in. Turnaround at operating level
OSV sector has bottomed; U/G to BUY 1H19 core loss came in below (worse) than our loss expectation, due mainly to deferred taxes in 2Q19. Otherwise, it would have met our expectation for operationally breaking-even in the quarter on higher OSV utilisation. Coupled with an improving operating outlook, the recent weakness in share price post its restructuring plan is an opportunity to BUY. Hence, we upgrade Icon to a BUY, on an unchanged TP of MYR0.085, pegged to 10x 2020 PER, equal to its 5-year mean valuations.

As you know KLCI is down about 10 % since early this year. My average margin is a very healthy double digit. This mean my selection has outperform the KLCI.
Of course I have many expensive shares in my collection like SERBA DINAMIK, FGV, Sime Darby Plantation, Sarawak Plantation, TaaNN, TM, Axiata, DiGi, MyeG, Greatec, CIMB, BIMB, KLCCP
IGBREIT, SUNREIT, PAVREIT, YTLREIT, CMTT, MQREIT, Air Asia, Sime Darby, CCB, Sunway , etc etc
These typical ""expensive"" stocks not many retailers can buy. Only the big boys play. If foreign funds don't come in to push, the expensive stocks cannot move. FF has been selling, hence KLCI continue to trend lower.
The only ones moving on Bursa are penny stocks since everyone can play. This is the sad sad state of our local market.
FYI, my Armada is giving me 300% return when it was a penny 15 and my KNM is giving 500% return, Velesto is giving me 200% return. Similarly with current prevailing price, ICON can easily gives another 200% return. Maybank usually are more stringent in their evaluation. So 9 is very pessimistic. Beside I con is back by very strong share holders. I have confident in this company. They just change their CEO. This is why things are moving..

1st Tier
1. Serba Dinamik - Interceptor
2nd Tier
2. Armada – Black Pearl
3. KNM – Fying Dutchman
4. Velesto – Empress
5. T7 Global – Adventure Galley
3rd Tier
6. Sapnrg – Queen Anne
7. Alam – Fancy
8. Icon – Royal Fortune
4th Tier
9. Barakah – Silent Mary
10. Scomies - Vangelis
The 1st already reach high but still have the potential to climb further to RM 5-6 with little downward risk before the recent share splits, bonus issues and free warrants exercise.
The 2nd is in uptrend/to rebound mode, higher upside and medium downside risk
The 3rd is going to rebound later (might be 20/21), smaller upside now, but low downside. Just to add on Sapnrg. The team in Sapnrg believe Sapnrg is a Mini Petronas? Here’s the best part, Since this company are backed by Strong Shareholders, if G can pay RM10.7 Billion to Tabung Haji, G might pay RM22 Billion for Sapnrg later for Sapura to take over Petronas for RM1.00 if simmilar situation happens to TH. Anything can happen in Malaysia. I put Icon in this tier since Icon is backed by strong shareholders..
The 4th is high risk.
For Barakah, I have taken out my Long-Term Investor hat and replace it with Trader’s Hat since the market capitalisation is around RM25 million and it has more liabilities than assets.
Based on information from the grape vine, what's in store for Barakah after the coming AGM end of this year is going to be interesting. They are finally taking measures to lift themselves out of financial distress state. The corporate restructuring exercise will see Barakah in general, adopting measures such as shares consolidation, issuing loan stock, rights issue & warrants. The exercise will see Barakah reborn into a debt-free company. Meaning, we have one less challenge ahead. To me, it’s a good start for 2020...
Once this is announced this stock will rocket to 0. 08....that’s 400% return from current price. This is even better than my Mercedes Benz's Cycle & Carriage last month exercise which is only 70% when they decided to take it private.
For Barakah and Scomies, I have applied Warren Warren Buffett Sifu (Ben Graham) Strategy in this engagements which is a ""cigar butt"" technique. You can google yourself what this strategy means.

You are spot on...
From what I understand, markets have dedicated middlemen called Market Makers who are responsible to make sure that there is always someone to buy or sell; this ensures that all instruments have sufficient liquidity. Market Makers may decide to lower their bid on a stock based on a high number of sellers, or raise their ask for a high number of buyers.
During an investor rush to buy or sell an instrument (perhaps in response to a news release), it's possible for the Market Maker to accumulate or distribute a large number of shares, without end-investors like you or me being involved on both sides of the same transaction.
Hence, if we are buying into such an illiquid stock in the first place I don't think we would have any investment strategy, we are just putting our at as a trader and trust our animal instinct.
As a rule of thumb, it is always not advisable to buy intio any stocks that is below 100,000 volumes. Fortunately, this is not the case of Icon. The average trading volume for the last 4 weeks is 71 times bigger than the minimal threshold.
So I recon these Market Maker are regulating this stock to keep it warm. Just to give you a flavor, today TDM is on P1 among the Plantation counters. It even beats all the expensive Plantation Stocks. You know why there's is a high interest in TDM?. It's is because of ECRL. ECRL will passed through TDM Plantation as it cruises 160 km/h.
I have been holding TDM since early this year and today the price has almost double. So it's just a matter of time when the Market Maker will starts goreng this stock again. All it needs is just one good new to spike it up again.
Till then....

https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/12/stock-market-us-china-trade-war-and-fe...
PUBLISHED THU, DEC 12 20192:35 AM Fred Imbert
The S&P 500 gained 0.9% to end the day at 3,168.57, notching a record close. The Nasdaq Composite also posted an all-time closing high, rising 0.7% to 8,717.32. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 220.75 points higher, or 0.8% at 28,132.05. All three of the major averages reached intraday records, their first since Nov. 27.
U.S. negotiators have the terms of the deal ready for President Donald Trump’s review. CNBC confirmed reports from earlier in the day that said U.S. negotiators are offering to cancel new China tariffs and reduce existing levies on Chinese goods by up to 50% on $360 billion worth of imports. The latest trade news comes ahead of a key Sunday deadline. If an agreement is not reached by Sunday, additional U.S. levies on Chinese products will take effect.
Trump said in a tweet earlier in the day both sides were getting “VERY close to a BIG DEAL with China.” They want it, and so do we!” The major indexes hit record highs following Trump’s tweet.
“People are very optimistic here that all the risks cited are going away,” said Ilya Feygin, senior strategist at WallachBeth Capital. “It just seems like people who have been skeptical have been forced into the market.”
He noted that weekly inflows into equity ETFs have ranged between $6 billion and $8 billion in recent weeks.
Caterpillar shares jumped 1.9% on Thursday while Micron Technology advanced 3.5%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) and the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) both rose more than 2.5% and hit all-time highs.
Bank stocks also got a lift as Treasury yields rose. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) climbed 2.9% and hit a 52-week high. J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup all closed at least 1.6% higher. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield advanced to 1.896% while the 2-year rate was at 1.66%.
Stocks started December on the wrong foot as worries around U.S.-China trade relations increased. In the first two sessions of the month, the Dow lost more than 500 points.
The world’s two largest economies have imposed tariffs on billions of dollars’ worth of one another’s goods since the start of 2018, battering financial markets and souring business and consumer sentiment.
Still, the major averages are up sharply for the year. The S&P 500 and Dow have jumped 26.4% and 20.6%, respectively, year to date. The Nasdaq is up around 31%.
Next year, however, should be tougher on Wall Street, CalSTRS CIO Christopher Ailman said.
“It will be choppy,” Ailman told CNBC’s Brian Sullivan in an interview that aired Thursday. “This is going to be another election year. Remember 2016? That was a really hard year where the market slugged it out to generate a positive return. We may have that kind of year because of all the rhetoric we’re going to hear.”

KUALA LUMPUR (Dec 16): Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd Research has maintained its ""Neutral"" call on the oil and gas sector, noting that it is positive on the Activity Outlook for 2020-2022 by Petronas and feels comforted that upstream activities would continue to stay elevated from the surge in 2019.
In a note today, the research house identified the big winners from Petronas' Activity Outlook. Among them are fabricators (e.g: Marine and Heavy Engineering Holdings Sdn Bhd and Sapura Energy Bhd), which will benefit from the surge in numbers of wellhead platforms (WHPs).
Based on the Activity Outlook, Kenanga Research said marine vessel providers (e.g: Perdana Petroleum Bhd, Alam Maritim Resources Bhd, Icon Offshore Bhd and Coastal Contracts Bhd) will benefit from the huge rise in demand for offshore support vessels (OSVs).
Kenanga Research also highlighted that offshore players (e.g: Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd and Carimin Petroleum Bhd) will continue to enjoy increased maintenance, construction and modification work orders.
""Meanwhile, Velesto Energy Bhd, [whose] rig fleet are currently fully chartered out, is expected to continue to enjoy high utilisation rates amidst sustained drilling rig demand,"" it said."

Cash Runway Analysis
For companies that have on average been loss making in the past we assess whether they have at least 1 year of cash runway.
Stable Cash Runway: Whilst unprofitable ICON has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years if it maintains its current positive free cash flow level.
Forecast Cash Runway: ICON is unprofitable but has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years, due to free cash flow being positive and growing by 30.1% per year."

TRading of shares in Icon Offshore Bhd (fundamental: 0/3, valuation: 0.3/3), which closed half a sen or 9.09% higher at six sen yesterday, made it to our Stocks with Momentum list for the first time since early October 2018.
At the closing bell, the offshore support vessel player recorded a total trading volume of 56.84 million shares, over 12 times than the average 4.64 million shares it recorded in the past 200 days. The loss-making company aims to turn profitable by the 1Q of this year if its shareholders back its cash call exercise aimed at slashing its debt by over a third, to help strengthen its balance sheet, according to managing director Datuk Seri Hadian Hashim.
Hadian said the focus will then shift to rejigging its business model, while squeezing efficiencies to stay competitive.
In its FY18, Icon Offshore impaired RM419.9 million of its fleet’s net book value. That led to a net loss of RM449 million on a revenue of RM199.7 million, its biggest full-year loss amid record low revenue. The group has an order book of RM650 million."

By Tom Kool - Jan 07, 2020, 6:05 PM CST
https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Oil-Prices-Soar-As-...
In what appears to be its first retaliation strike, Iran has claimed to have fired tens of ground-to-ground rockets at the Ain al-Assad military base in Iraq.
Reuters and AFP news agencies cite a U.S. official that confirms the strike, but also says that there’s no information yet on casualties or damage. Additional reports came in that a military base in Erbil, in the Kurdish part of Iraq has also been struck by ballistic missiles.
Major Iranian news agency ISNA reported early on Wednesday morning that ""This morning, courageous fighters of the IRGC's Air Force launched a successful operation called Operation Martyr Soleimani, with the code 'Oh Zahra' by firing tens of ground-to-ground missiles at the base of the terrorist and invasive U.S. forces,""
The attacks come shortly after the Iranian clerical leadership vowed retaliation, with spiritual leader Ayatollah Khamenei suggesting the Islamic Republic would strike against U.S. forces in the region. According to a report from the New York Times, Khamenei showed up to a meeting of Iran’s National Security Council and laid down the conditions for a response to the slaying of Qassem Soleimani.

另一方面，艾芬黄氏发现，在当前环境下，小资本油气股营运现金流改善程度较大资本股来得大，多数公司的净负债比均低于一倍，仅有EA科技（EATECH,5259,主板交通物流组）和柏达纳石油例外。
“尽管标志岸外现金流和债务缺口最为显著，但随着重组计划持续进行，大股东国家股份公司（Ekuinas）同意额外注资1亿8300万令吉来降低债务。”
世霸动力（SERBADK,5279,主板能源组）、沙布拉能源（SAPNRG,5218,主板能源组）和达洋企业（DAYANG,5141,主板能源组）营运现金流在2019财政年第二季出现下滑，而阿玛达情况也未拉响警报，主要是一旦公司重新定义15亿令吉的Kraken油田债务，净负债比也将随减记回拨完成而显著改善。
整体来看，艾芬黄氏研究认为，虽然去年布兰特原油平均下跌10%，但小资本油气股却在国油释出领域活动增加讯号下普遍走高，相信整体投资策略依旧完好，维持领域“中和”评级，市场焦点将继续落在升降式钻油井、岸外支援船舰、岸外维修与制造领域。
“我们更青睐小资本油气股，主要是盈利前景更好、经济环境低迷及监管变化可能对大资本油气股盈利带来风险。”
选股方面，艾芬黄氏表示，下游工厂维修和好转将有望扶持戴乐集团（DIALOG,7277,主板能源组）和世霸动力前景，而升降式钻油井需求攀升则有助提振VELESTO能源（VELESTO,5243,主板能源组）；阿玛达重估新闻和岸外支援船舰领域复苏也有助改善投资前景。"

“与此同时，我们发现标志岸外（ICON,5255,主板能源组）、柏达纳石油（PERDANA,7108,主板能源组）、沿海工程（COASTAL,5071,主板能源组）和环境海事资源（ALAM,5115,主板能源组）去年合约显著增加，看好今年升降式钻油井、岸外支援船舰、岸外维修与制造需求将持续高企。”

On Jan 9, CIMB Investment Bank announced on behalf of Icon’s board that in respect of the rights issue with warrants, the board had resolved to fix the entitlement basis to be on the basis of 100 rights shares for every one Icon share held after the entitlement date of Jan 23 at 5pm, and the issue price of the rights shares at 10.5 sen apiece.
“The rights issue price represents a discount of approximately 20.6% to the theoretical ex-rights price (TERP) of Icon shares of 13.2 sen after adjusting for the share consolidation, calculated based on the five-market day volume weighted average market price (VWAMP) of Icon shares up to and including Jan 8, being the last market day immediately preceding the date of this announcement, of 5.7 sen per Icon share.
“The exercise price of the rights warrants (and hence the financiers warrants and the creditor warrants) at 16.5 sen (exercise price). The exercise price represents a premium of 25.0% to the TERP of Icon shares of 13.2 sen after adjusting for the share consolidation as described above,”
Additionally, Icon had also on Jan 9 entered into an underwriting agreement in relation to the rights issue with warrants with several financial institutions.
CIMB Investment Bank Berhad, Hong Leong Investment Bank Berhad, KAF Investment Bank Berhad and Kenanga Investment Bank Berhad will underwrite 357.14 million rights shares, representing approximately 15.2% of the total rights shares available for subscription.
“Due to the determination of the rights issue price and in respect of the issuance to the financiers and the issuance to the creditor, a total of 263.70 million new Icon shares together with 65.92 million new free detachable warrants shall be allotted and issued in a single tranche to coincide with the issuance and the listing of the rights shares and the rights warrants,” it added.

Maybank is usually very stringent in their evaluation. Usually the share price performance tend to outperform their evaluation. This I have seen in a number of cases like Greatec, Armada and Alam just to give a few example.
Like I said don't jump into conclusion until we fully understand this latest offering by ICON. ICON is back by a very strong and powerful shareholders who has been in this business for many year.

I suppose everyone have different views in making their respective investments. For me, it is easier if you invest on something that goes in line with the country’s direction and at the same time doing something that will benefits this Country as well as the Global community. I always has this rule of thumb when I made my investments. I do this as it will benefits the people surrounding me and also to the Global Community.

Hi All,
Given the confusing corporate exercise of ICON, may I kindly share my thoughts.
Assuming now, I have 1,000,000 ICON shares. These will be consolidated first with the ratio of 50:1 which means that 1,000,000/50 = 20,000 shares. And of course by theory the price will also be increased by a similar ratio if we take the price of today 0.04*50=RM2.
Then the second part regarding the Rights Issue which is based on the consolidated shares. You will be given the option to subscribe to the RI at a ratio of 100:1, which means that from the 20,000 shares you have now, if you choose to fully subscribe the RI , this would result in final total shares of 20,000 + ( 20,000*100 = 2,000,000 ) = 2,020,000 shares + free warrants. This would cost you 0.105*2,000,000 = RM210,000
However, the price now wont remain at RM2 ( consolidated price ) anymore due to the massive amount of new shares via the RI. It will then be diluted to 0.132 which is the TERP ( Theoretical Ex Rights Price ) given by the bankers. This TERP of 0.132 is based on 5 days VWMAP before the announcement of 0.057."

Right subscription is 0.105cent, then Icon-OR listing after ex-date should be 0.055cent (0.160 - 0.105= 0.055cent). Based on @IIImNoob analysis which i verify is valid - for every one Icon share you hold now, you can get 2 Icon-OR. Then if you have 1,000,0000 Icon share now (today closed at 0.045cent), you will get 2,000,000 Icon-OR (which assuming from basis as mentioned will be worth 0.055cent each). You can get RM110,000 just by selling the 2,000,000 Icon-OR after ex-date. And you can also sell the 20,000 consolidated Icon share after ex-date at 0.16 cent (based on Maybank TP).You decide if you want to hold or buy more Icon tomorrow ? Disclaimer : If ex-price of Icon-OR lower than 0.055cent, please don't blame me, but blame Maybank TP of 0.16cent which I gather from this blog. I have not verified the TP with Maybank Invest. The whole argument above is based on this blog which mentioned Maybank TP is 0.16cent. Do you believe Maybank TP as mentioned ?

The price of 0.1238 or as the bankers calculated TERP of 0.132 by theory based on earlier price of 0.057 before the announcement...
The million dollar question is what will be the price at the end .... ?
The price will of course be derived from many many factors ... it can be positive ... or it can be also negative .... maybe even lower than RI price of 0.105"

If based on 4 sen, it shall be 0.1238 but with foc warrant, it will be lower than this price.
Ya, agreed that eventually it all depends on market support and acceptability of this exercise, hence the price 0.1238 may also drop.
However, based on current support at 0.04 to 0.035, it’s good indication of market positive response.

Ppl like me wont be able to subscribe. and this is where im coming from on feeling screwed by the 100-to-1 cash call on the shareholders whereas the bankers walked away with almost no haircut (the big ones anyways).
RHB donate a 0.01% haircut.
Bank Pembangunan gave 1.07%.
OCBC took a massive 14.9% haircut.
Maybank islamic walked off with 0.72%.
Short term syndicate bankers donate 0.01%.
Maybank took 5.09% haircut.
affin took at 39% hit.
ocbc (labuan) suffered with 46% haircut.
overall haircut for the banks: 2.26%.
What the fuck is this? Granted shareholders rank below bankers, but for a company in financial distress for the banks to collectively ""donate"" some piece or armpit hair for 2.26% of total loans is bloody fucking shite.
I vote for no go for restuructruing and let the fucking banks suffer the pain as well."

nelson you need to scroll up what was discussed earlier. Let me cut and paste for you.
This is a very good explaination
(Quote)
500Bilis 1,000,000 shares brought @ 4 sen, total RM40k paid.
After consol, 1mil shares become 20,000 shares @ RM40k paid earlier.
20,000 shares entitled RI of 2,000,000 shares at RM0.105.
If exercise all RI, total additional fund need fork out is RM210k.
Total shares in hand 20,000 + 2,000,000 = 2,020,000 value at RM40k + RM210k = RM250k or RM0.1238 per share.
Imagine those didnt opt for RI, RM40k for 20,000 shares...
14/01/2020 11:42 PM
500Bilis If exercise all, RM0.1238 vs RM0.132 is aldy a gain....

100 shares = 2 consolidation shares (@1.75) + 200 rights (@0.105). The rights theoretical opening price will be 0.315 (0.42-0.105), way above the costs price. Those who bought will be very anxious and hope the price stay at current level in order to cash in the fat bonus."

JANUARY 22, 2020 @ 4:13PM
BY BERNAMA
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nst.com.my/node/558815/amp
KUALA LUMPUR: Bank Negara Malaysia’s (BNM) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to reduce the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) to 2.75 per cent from 3.0 per cent as a pre-emptive measure to secure improving growth trajectory amid price stability.
It said downside risks remain due to geopolitical tensions and policy uncertainties in a number of countries, although monetary easing across major economies in the second half of 2019 has helped ease financial conditions and is expected to continue to support economic activity.
“This could cause a resurgence of financial market volatility and weigh on the global growth outlook,” BNM said in its first Monetary Policy Statement for the year here, today.
Following the reduction in the OPR, the ceiling and floor rates of the corridor of it were correspondingly reduced to 3.00 per cent and 2.50 per cent, respectively.
For Malaysia’s economy, the central bank said the latest indicators and supply disruptions in commodity-related sectors point to the moderate expansion of economic activities in the fourth quarter.
“For 2019, growth will be within the projected range, while for 2020, growth is expected to gradually improve, with continued support from household spending and better export performance.
“Overall investment activity is expected to record a modest recovery, underpinned by ongoing andnew projects, both in the public and private sectors,” it added.
However, downside risks to growth remained and these include uncertainty from various trade negotiations, geopolitical risks, weaker-than-expected growth of major trade partners, heightened volatility in financial markets, and domestic factors that include weakness in commodity-related sectors and delays in the implementation of projects.
Headline inflation is expected to average higher this year from 0.7 per cent in 2019 but remains modest.
“The trajectory of headline inflation will be dependent on global oil and commodity price developmentsand the timing of the lifting of the domestic retail fuel price ceilings.
“Underlying inflation is expected to remain broadly stable, reflecting the continued expansion in economic activity and the absence of strong demand pressures,” it said."

I have been asking the same question since yesterday. I spoke to my IB, they also don't have a clue.
As Mummy said, never listen to strangers...
Let's explore this together, I'm as curious as you on this.
One thing I can tell you is when Serba Dinamik did their Bonus Issues and RI, the warrant price open at 39 cents that it shoot up to 60 cents before stabilizing to 40 plus. Serba warrant can easiily fetch more then RM 1. I'm still holding both Serba mother and the warrant .
Let's wait and listen more. If anyone knows more about do share it here too as I'm expecting something similar here.

Long time no see....
You always come whenever any stock shoot up...that means you also can smell money...
All I can say it's too early to make any judgement on Icon. One thing is clear is that those that bought before and after ex date has made their Angpow plus more bonus coming in with the right issues plus the free warrant.
If you want to know more, please scroll up what we have been discussing.
Of course, the share holders can choose if they want to accept or reject the offer. It's everyone call. Everyone has the opportunity to assess and decide and they gave existing shareholders ample time to decide.
One thing I'm very clear, is that the real loser will be the one who has missed this opportunity. As far as I'm concerned, I have taken my profits from my non Right issue shares. Look at Kingston 1, he just rewarded himself with a nice SLK.
I will definitely subscribe to the right issues as I believe its very attractive with the free warrant plus the potential price it may end up with. So far the Icon deal has been very good for me. I have very good experience with Serba and La Farge so I'm willing to go all the way..
Remember Greatec?
If you listen to me you could have made more money. Greatec has been one of my best investment.
Always think of the big picture. Trading is just a small agenda to spice up our journey. if we can make money along the way that will be more fun.
Along the way, if Icon is not meeting our business plan objectives, just cut our losses and move on as the opportunities are still hugh.

Touch wood. That's not going to happen. May bank is very positive on ICON. They rate ICON better than Sapnrg in their recomendation. It's a BUY vs HOLD for Sapnrg
Here's why I think, ICON will prevail..
Oil & Gas - Upstream Activities to Stay Elevated
Author: kiasutrader | Publish date: Fri, 3 Jan 2020, 10:01 AM
While we were positively surprised with the OPEC’s decision to deepen existing production cuts in 1QCY20, we were somewhat disappointed that the coalition failed to announce any extension of production cuts beyond that. We still view that continued production cuts is imperative to sustaining oil prices at current levels, with further downside risks coming from: (i) enforcement measures of production cut compliance among OPEC members, (ii) continued uncertainties in U.S.-China trade tensions, and (iii) continued rise in U.S. oil output. Overall, we assumed an average Brent projection of USD60/barrel for 2020-2021. Meanwhile, local upstream activities are expected to stay elevated from high levels seen in 2019, as guided in Petronas’ latest Activity Outlook. We have identified selective biggest winners to include: (i) fabricators (e.g. MHB, SAPNRG), to benefit from the high surge in number of WHP, and (ii) marine vessel providers (e.g. ALAM, COASTAL, ICON, PERDANA), benefiting from surge in AHTS demand. Offshore maintenance players (e.g. DAYANG, CARIMIN) is also expected to see further increase in works, even after a high in 2019, while VELESTO is also anticipated to see healthy utilisations on the back of sustained jack-up drilling rig demands. Maintain NEUTRAL on the sector, given limited upside to large-cap Petronas-related counters, although with increased optimism towards equipment and services providers. As for stock selections, defensive and growth-seeking investors could seek out stable names such as YINSON and SERBADK, although bargain hunters could target some laggard-play angle in heavily discounted names, of which we like PANTECH, SAPNRG, UZMA and COASTAL."

c) Between Broker and Broker, the deduction of <100/101>, of the Transacted Price is applicable.
Remarks 1 ):-Participating Organisations are to take note of the following Share Consolidation exercise by ICON OFFSHORE BERHAD.
The Share Consolidation comprises the following:-
SHARE CONSOLIDATION OF EVERY 50 EXISTING ORDINARY SHARES IN ICON OFFSHORE BERHAD (“ICON”) (“EXISTING SHARES”) INTO 1 CONSOLIDATED SHARE IN ICON (“CONSOLIDATED SHARES(S)”) HELD AT 5.00 P.M ON THURSDAY, 23 JANUARY 2020 (“ENTITLEMENT DATE”) (“ SHARE CONSOLIDATION”).
In relation to the Share Consolidation undertaken by ICON as a SPEEDS Corporate Exercise, Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad would like to highlight that:
(a) on or after the Ex-date on 22 January 2020, trading of ICON shares will be based on the newly adjusted share after the Share Consolidation of ICON shares,
(b) on the basis of settlement taking place after 23 January 2020 with consolidated ICON shares, any entitled shareholder who owns ICON shares as at Ex-date may sell only up to the maximum ICON shares he expects to receive after the Share Consolidation, i.e. the reduced amount, on or after the Ex-date 22 January 2020.
With the adjustments pursuant to the Share Consolidation effected on ICON shareholders’ CDS account at the end of the Entitlement Date (“Books Closure Date”), an entitled ICON shareholder may use the following basis to estimate the maximum number of ICON shares that he may sell from the Ex-date until the Book Closing Date which is from 22 January 2020 until 23 January 2020.
Number of ICON shares that may be = Number of shares held / 50
sold on 22 January 2020 until 23 January 2020 (All fractional shares computed should be disregarded)
Illustration:
For example, if Mr X owns or purchases 5000 ICON shares on cum basis on 21 January 2020, his CDS account would still show 5000 ICON shares until 23 January 2020. However, as a results of the above Share Consolidation exercise, Mr X’s 5000 ICON shares in his CDS account will be adjusted to 100 ICON shares on the night of 23 January 2020 which is the Book Closing Date. Therefore, Mr X may, if he so wishes, sells only up to 100 ICON shares on or after the Ex-date i.e. from 22 January 2020 onwards.
Participating Organisations are hereby requested to caution all dealers and remisiers that, during the period from 22 January 2020 until 23 January 2020, they are only entitled to sell the maximum of 1/50 of the shares owned before the Ex-date. Participants Organisations are reminded that it is important to caution all dealers and remisiers on the above to prevent the dealers and remisiers from overselling of their client’s position.
Remarks 2) :- The Share Consolidation entails the consolidation of every 50 Existing Shares into 1 Consolidated Share as at 5.00 p.m. on Thursday, 23 January 2020. The Consolidated Shares will be listed and quoted on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad on 24 January 2020, being the next market day immediately after the Entitlement Date (""Listing Date""). A notice of allotment will be issued and despatched to the entitled shareholders for the Share Consolidation at the addresses set out in the Record of Depositors within 4 market days after the Listing Date."

The real winners are really those who bought yesterday (and keeps until today market closes) as their entry cost is much lower while they still entitled to the RIs and Warrants (if they subscribe la).

Wendy Sis,
Actually everything is already on the table.We have a good team in this Forum and I believe I have commented enough. Summing up..
Warren Buffet said ""Never invest in a business you cannot understand.”
I suppose everyone have different views in making their respective investments. For me, it is easier if you invest on something that goes in line with the country’s direction and at the same time doing something that will benefits this Country as well as the Global community. I always has this rule of thumb when I made my investments. I do this as it will benefits the people surrounding me and also to the Global Community.
10 years from now as I look back, I want to feel that I was part of these success stories. My Business Plan for 2020 covers 4 Boutiques.
1. Plantations
2. Digital Economy
3. O&G
4. VMY 2020.
Just to give you a flavor, here's my Business Plan for 2020 for my O&G Boutique.
Oil & Gas – I have invested in 11 Energy Companies. All these Battleships are name after Pirates of the Caribbean. Here are the Battleship in term of Margin..
1. Black Pearl Armada
2. Interceptor Serba
3. Flying Dutchman KNM
4. Empress Velesto
5. Fancy Alam
6. Adventure Galley T7
7. Royal Fortune ICON
8. Queen Anne Sapnrg
9. Jolly Roger TH Heavy
10. Vangelis Scomies
11. Silent Mary Barakah
Catalyst
20% of government revenue in 2020
50 Billion Petronas Capex
Each US$1 per barrel increase in oil prices brings the Treasury RM300 million in revenue per year.
From the above list, 3 are PN17 Companies as I believe the best way to learn about a company is to put your stakes into the company. I always like to be in the driver seat. Never like the idea to sit on the sideline to be a POM POM Gal since my University days...
Currently performance in term of margin for my 4 Boutiques are as follows:
P1 - Plantation
P2 - Oil & Gas
P3 - Digital Economy
P4 - Visit Malaysia Year 2020
It’s just like an F1 Race between Mercedes Benz, Ferrari, Red Bulls and Maclaren. At this moment I'm feeling really upbeat about 2020.
Cheers!
Captain Mabel Sparrow"

Kingston 1 is really an inspiration. He know how to trade has a very good flair for business. He took calculated risk and he was subsequently rewarded.
Mercedes is definitely a good car. I know because I have 5 Mercedes Benz in my collections.
SLK definitely a nice car..
Once again, Well done !

One of the best decision I ever made was to sell all my shares prior to GE 14 as I'm not sure where the country was heading at that time. I made good profits as the index was above 1800.
I reenter KLSE after GE14. Despite KLCI is s below 1600, my average margin for all my holding for my collections in my 4 Boutiques is a very healthy double digit.
Always think of the big picture. Trading is just a small agenda to spice up our journey. Along the way, if you feel its not meeting your business plan objectives, just cut your losses and move on as the opportunities are still hugh.
Just face it that you are just a trader. I'm an investors. Like I said many times, there's no right and wrong answer. You choose what it's best to you.
No need to feel so stress up. Let's just enjoy the company..
Good Night"

Your cost should cover all your acquisition cost plus the RI conversion cost which was explained in the previous discussion. Just scroll up.
My price will be based on the prevailing price. In my case, my breakeven for this counter is 0.135 per share. This include the RI conversion price. Anything above this price is a profit to me. I will cut my loss if it goes below 20 % of 0.135.
Hence my bonus will be the price of free warrant plus any price which is above 0. 135 per share.
Currently my margin is a very very healthy margin.
Based on Maybank and Wall Street valuation that I posted last night, the future looks good for me.
The chart currently look very Bullish.
I'm not asking anyone to follow me. I'm just sharing based on my own personal trading plan. In my case, I will take the whole RI offer from ICON.
You still have time to decide by looking at the price movement. You can either
1. Take all
2. Take some of the offer.
3. Sell your right OR
4. You can complete reject Icon offer.
As for me, I'm going in. Icon is part of my Business Plan for the next coming 3 years.

Your remiser is correct.
This is how ICON Right Issues Works You can match that with your existing lots that you have..
Assuming
1,000,000 shares brought @ 4 sen, total RM40k paid.
After consolidation, 1million shares become 20,000 shares @ RM40k paid earlier.
20,000 shares entitled Right Issues of 2,000,000 shares at RM0.105 (RI Price)
If exercise all RI, total additional fund need fork out is RM210k.
Total shares in hand 20,000 + 2,000,000 = 2,020,000 value at RM40k + RM210k = RM250k or RM0.1238 per share.
Imagine those didn’t opt for RI, they have to forked RM40k for 20,000 shares...
For every 4 Right Issues Share you will get a Free Warrant.
As for the warrant price, we don't know yet. Based on my Serba Dinamik Warrant, the warrant are trading above 40 cents per warrant. The highest bid was 60 and it expected to go beyond RM 1.
All the best!"

What's important is know your limit where to cut your losses if required.

24/01/2020 8:39 PM
I agree. Not many retailer will be trapped as they should be well informed by now. Thanks to the great Teamwork here.
The one who are trapped are the Contra Player and IDSS. For speculative counter like this one should play with cash and not on borrowed money.
Like I suggest this morning, everyone should make their own Business case based on your respective past tradings with this counter. Your cost should cover all your acquisition cost plus the RI conversion cost which was explained in the previously. .
Your price should be based on the prevailing price. In my case, my break even for this counter is 0.135 per share. This include the RI conversion price. Anything above this price is a profit to me. I will cut my loss if it goes below 20 % of 0.135 as I have higher tolerance for risk.
Hence my bonus will be the price of free warrant plus any price which is above 0. 135 per share. Based on my Serba exercise the warrants should be equally attractive.
Even currently without the OR, my margin for ICON is a very very healthy margin.
Moving forward, based on Maybank and Wall Street valuation that I posted last night, the future looks good for ICON. You should also read this report to get the full story.
https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/ekuinas-navigates-icon-offshore...
Even the chart is currently looking very Bullish. You still have time to decide by looking at the price movement. You can either
1. Take all
2. Take some of the offer.
3. Sell your right OR
4. You can complete reject Icon offer.
As for me, I have accepted to take the whole RI offers. I'm going in. It's a GO Decision as Icon is part of my Business Plan for the next coming 3 years.
Happy New Year Everyone...
Drive and fly safe...

I thought consolidation is compled. But seems like not. I really no clue so not get into after first round of limit up. 2nd day up so high again, i go read all news still not understand.
Maybe it is good for me not to understand and this not get into it. I don't see this is a great company to get in, perhaps maybe in future it will be greater company. Yet I still don't understand why it up from 0.1x to 0.8x and even above 0.90 once.

Icon is designated, it means paid first before you
can buy. Indirectly, it means no more contra and no more naked short selling. So, the movement of the Icon shares price before the listing of the right issue shares is totally under their control. It can be pushed up higher or it can be pressed down.
The movement of OR is hard to predict also., but most likely is down because retailers can sell the OR forms in hand since yesterday."

The lion eventually defeated the bull. He went to the dolphin and said, “What kind of friend are you?

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800003587.jsp?ftp=133","Jan 26, 2020 1:07 PM","Mabel","ICON went limit up for the wrong reasons. Some are saying its because the terms were so convoluted and that not many know how to calculate the capital reduction.
PLEASE, this is not your first rodeo, this is not the first capital reduction exercise. You are all supposed to be professional investors or advisors.
The limit up was obviously caused by the 50 into one capital reduction. A simple calculation showed that ICON had 2.377bn shares. Divide that by 50 = 47.5 million shares. That must be close to the fewest number of shares listed by a company on Bursa.
The complaining parties ARE those who SOLD SHORT unwittingly. Imagine you had 100,000 prior to the ex date. It was trading at 4 sen, you value was RM4,000, and as with 99.9999% of ICON investors, you had lost money already big time.
Then you woke up and saw the price going limit up.
(0.035 x 50) + (100 × 0.105) ÷ 101 = 0.12
Add the 30 sen limit up, you have 42 sen, today add another 30 sen you have 72 sen.
As you can see even at 72 sen, with just 47.5m shares its market cap is just RM34.2m. Of course, there are still other derivatives to cater to but let's forget that for now.
The main reason for the double limit up... OVERSOLD SHORT. Imagine that same guy with 100,000 shares (value RM4,000) and seeing it going limit up at 42 sen. Sell first lar... Trouble is he sold 100,000 consolidated shares when in reality he had only 100,000/50 = 2,000 shares.
Imagine you have to buy back the 98,000 ... say at an average of 62 sen ... you would have lost 62-42 = 20 sen x 98,000 =RM19,600
Bearing in mind your value was just RM4,000 to start with. The figures will multiply if you had shorted 1,000,000 ...
Bursa has done no wrong. This has been the same process for the longest time. Even our online accounts have default settings that do not allow investors to short sell stocks, i.e. selling what you don't have in your portfolio.
The ONLY people who can short sell are DAY TRADERS or proprietary traders or company dealers... though some bigshots do deal through company dealers' accounts first. Hence if you kena short sell... you get very little sympathy from all.

There are altogether, four underwriters that will underwrites (that is, pick up any rights that entitled retail shareholders do not take up) RM 37.5 million representing 15.2% of total rights (with warrants) to achieve the minimum intended gross proceeds of RM 145.5 million.
The main shareholders (all government linked) had already given an undertaken to subscribe to their entitlement of RM 108 million (145.5 - 37.5).
So as retail shareholders, there is the comfort that the major shareholders will subscribe, the four underwriters will subscribe if you do not want. Base on this, the underwriters (I am speculating here) will maintain the price at an attractive level so that retail shareholders would want to subscribe otherwise they will have to cough out RM 37.5 million. If one look back to Dayang, that was what happened. This is what Shareview123 meant.
In addition, financial institutions that had given loans to ICON have agreed to take the rights (with warrants) as part payment of loans extended. In this way RM 27.7 million of outstanding loans has been settled. What this signify is that financial institutions are bullish of the OSV sector in the coming years that they will eventually sell their (right) shares (and warrants) to recoup their money and maybe more. Of course, downside is always there.
Now about the consolidation of 50 to 1, it is not possible that one can sell short on ex-date (or any other day). Online trading platform or any platforms for that matter would immediately showed the reduced number of shares and the platforms will immediately reject the sell order. The scenario narrated is totally a non-issue. One just cannot sell more shares than one owned. I am not talking of those short sellers. I am only talking of retail shareholders. If you are a retail shareholders and it happened to you, then change investment bank, their trading platform is faulty.
Those who are able to sell shorts, belong to a special group of traders and there is no need for sympathy for them as they know exactly what they are doing - gambling.
The confusion on the prices arises because the rights (cum warrant) issue was ex on the same date i.e. 22 jan 2020, thus the price is immediately adjusted as if the rights (cum warrants) are fully subscribed as is all others rights issues while some may think that the prices should be the consolidated price of above RM 1+ before the rights.
Yes, there would / could be limit down when market open on Tuesday.
Of course, all this confusion could have been avoided should the Adviser and Bursa had just went with the rights issue without consolidation. That is, 1.5 to 2.2 times (minimum to maximum gross proceed) the issued and paid up of original 1,177,185,100 shares.
Appreciate if the Adviser / Bursa explains what purpose the consolidation serve?
Happy investing in the Rat year."

Suddenly, the plane developed engine trouble. In spite of the best efforts of the pilot, the plane started to go down. Finally, the pilot grabbed a parachute and yelled to the passengers that they better jump, and he himself bailed out.
Unfortunately, there were only three parachutes remaining.
The doctor grabbed one and said “I’m a doctor, I save lives, so I must live,” and jumped out.
The old lawyer then said, “I’m a lawyer and lawyers are the smartest people in the world. I deserve to live.” He also grabbed a parachute and jumped.
The priest looked at the little boy and said, “My son, I’ve lived a long and full life. You are young and have your whole life ahead of you. Take the last parachute and live in peace.”
The little boy handed the parachute back to the priest and said, “Not to worry Father. The smartest man in the world just took off with my back pack.”"

First, it is not compulsory for right issues to have underwriter(s). There was no underwriter for Perdana's RCPS rights.
Issuers of rights have to pay a fee to the underwriter(s). And there are terms and conditions where the underwriter(s) can ""wiggle"" their way out of the underwriting obligation. Nonetheless, it is in the interest of the underwriter(s) to want the entitled retail shareholders to subscribe, otherwise they will have to come up with a maximum RM 37.5 million to give to ICON for the rights shares (cum warrants) should no retailers subscribe.
There are many ""ways to skin the cat"" as they say; and in this case, consolidation!
So 99.9999% of retail shareholders have lost money through the consolidation. Unless the loss is small, most retail shareholders, I believe, will subscribe to average down their share price. This left a bitter taste, being forced to subscribe.
The views expounded on 25/1 10:28am & 10:45am and 26/1 6:57pm by Shareview123 on whether retailers are encouraged to subscribe or not, appear a bit contradictory. But nevertheless, encouragement is always better than force.
Again, taking Perdana as an example, there were also many discussion whether to subscribe or not, as should all the RCPS be converted to normal shares, the total share base would be enlarged 3 times from the original. But, today, the price has appreciated to 0.525; it is 1.28 x NA (0.41).
Now, for ICON, there is warrant (to be given free), the exercise price is 0.168 within 8 years (duration of warrant). The NA of ICON after all the rights and conversion is calculated to be 0.13 (pg 38 of prospectus) for the maximum case. Following Perdana, there is the potential that ICON share price might appreciate to 1.28 x NA, i.e. 0.166
Taking up the rights at 0.105 to average down one's price to maybe 0.12 to 0.13; and with potential for ICON shares to appreciate to, say, 0.16 will give about 20% gain.
Now of course the question would be, when, if ever. Please then refer to Petronas' Activity Outlook 2020-2022 page 61 and decide for oneself whether to invest more money or not.
Happy investing in the RAT year."

Good observation jaynetan!
I don't have Perdana however I have put my stake in other good companies like Serba, Penta, KLCC, Axiata, Digi, TM, Revenue, Inari, FGV, Sime Plantation, IOI Corp, SOP, Gamuda, Sunway etc etc for my 4 Boutiques:
1. Plantations
2. Digital Economy
3. O&G
4. VMY 2020.
For O&G, I have also put my stake in 3 inexpensive PN17 Companies as I believe the best way to learn is to put your stakes in it.
1. Scomies
2. TH Heavy
3. Barakah
All the above are waiting for restructuring.
As I have experience in Alam and ICON, once the operators have collected enough they will push these stocks up. This is exactly happened to Armada, Velesto and KNM. Based on these experience, I'm actually not too worry about getting ""Stuck"" if the rewards is more than 100%.
Another example is Greatec. Many were eager to cash in at 80 plus . I only started to cash in when it hits 1.50, 2nd at 2.50 and i will cash the remaining when it is listed at the Main Board end of this year. Greatec hit 2.91 last Friday. It continues to be the Darling for IR4 in the Techs sectors..
If you think yourselves as an Investors, you should be prepared to HOLD and most importantly, Never use borrowed Money..

This are some of the messages I received from my IB.
Trading of rights: 24/01/2020 until 31/01/2020. You can sell your rights, if you do not wish to subscribe.
Kindly inform your acceptance regarding this rights issue before 5pm 31/1/2020 or it shall be treated as your rights will be lapsed.

From my experience, good companies do not have much price volatility. Failed companies have extremely large price swings because people with differing views drives the prices up and down. SO, failed companies can potentially be GOLD MINES for some PEOPLE.
Just take a look at ICON, what happened last week was phenomenal. This is even better than my Mercedes Benz's Cycle & Carriage exercise which is only 70% increase when they decided to take it private.
Look at TH Heavy, with just only one positive news it shot up 30% on a single day. The stock until today still maintain it's momentum at 13. When it was below trading at 8-9 nobody cares. Now everyone is chasing for it. Same things happened with Alam.

If such happens, I strongly believe that the market can be controlled as the majority shares will be owned by a certain party rather than multiple parties. On top of that, Icon will have less obligation to the financial debt which is good to minimize the financial obligation by saving the debit financial cost, hence making the company to profitable someday. Moreover, the majority will certainly want to have the capital return in the open market of the shares that they have purchased which means the chances the share prices will be stabilized sooner or later. So I want to be positive and will take the OR and keep and I strongly believe it returns my investment."

There are a lot of professionals in PAS in many area. not only professional in islamic area but also medical, engineering, academic, science, economy and others. Many professionals joined PAS; they may not in front runner but contribute to the organization & shaping policies/ ideas.
PAS do have a team or lab that do economy analysis, which involve analyst and specialist, did come out with proposal for economy solution, that being produced before the GE14. For example replacment/ alternative of GST; intro of Capital Gain Tax. Some ideas was then proposed by other party, but with different terms.
However, what is lacked, publicity not on their side, media always give bad perception to them, and their method is quite passive (other party might love to do something that is populist, gimmick, but empty). Once people ""know"" PAS, they will start to accept."

I can just only advise you but the decision at the end of the day it's still at your hand and you have to decide. If you are facing no commitment or money issue as you have extra then u can subscribe for the OR to Mother Share at the price of RM 0.105 but you will need to think careful if the price is hit above than the purchase price then you will saw the profit. The second way it's just burn the OR away if you scare of the risk then the mother share you still have on hand will need to see how long it's take to gain profit. both of this you will need to think it carefully no one able to help you out.
What is the price when you bought it the you will need to count on there."

You bought your mother share at RM1.75 per share (assuming you bought at 3.5 sen prior to consolidation). Assuming full subscription, the mother share should converge to around RM0.120 per share. Your best option is to either subscribe and wait for a turnaround or sell now. Your call.
And if you think that it will hit RM1.75 per share prior to the issuance in 3 weeks time, then you need to ask who will be so retarded to buy, knowing that the share base will increase by 10 folds. But then again, there are those who bought at RM0.90. So who knows that stupidity really has no cure."

Why didn’t you sell your Mother Share last week during the 3 days limit up after the ex date? You could have recovered some of your cost.
For your information, ICON shares been hammered by the downfall of O&G industry from 2014 until 2018. All O&G players were hit. Most small players are already gone. This company has more than 20 vessels serving Petronas. The current vessel is not enough and they need to outsource from outside due to shortage in supply. I expect 2019 result will be much better 2018 because there will be no impairment as they have already made the impairment more than 70 million in 2018.
ICON is backed by strong Major Investors and Equinas itself keep supporting ICON for this scheme. All banks also support the scheme because they see the future of this company. Kenanga Research are expecting to see a continuation of the elevated activity levels going into 2020. A read-through of Petronas’ latest Activity Outlook 2020-2022 was mostly positive, as most upstream value chains are expected to see approximately maintained levels from 2019, while several of them anticipated to see a surge. Of which, they have identified the biggest winners to include (i) fabricators (e.g. SAPNRG, MHB), with almost a doubling in the number of well-head platforms (WHP), and (ii) marine vessel players (e.g. ALAM, ICON, PERDANA, COASTAL), with a huge surge in the number of anchor handling tug supply (AHTS) vessels. Beside Kenanga, Maybank has also given a BUY Call on ICON.
Here’s Wall Street’s Valuation on ICON.
REWARDS
Trading at 93.1% below its fair value. Earnings are forecast to grow 116.6% per year. Below Fair Value: ICON (MYR0.54) is trading below our estimate of fair value (MYR9.75). ICON is forecast to become profitable over the next 3 years, which is considered faster growth than the savings rate (3.4%). ICON's is expected to become profitable in the next 3 years.
RISK ANALYSIS
Does not have a meaningful market cap (MYR16M). Highly volatile share price over past 3 months
I suggest you make your own Business case based on your past engagements with this counter.
Your cost should cover all your acquisition cost plus the RI conversion cost. In my case, my break even cost for ICON is 0.135 per share with RI included. Anything above this price will be profit for me. (FYI, if I take my average cost based on my total number of shares that I have traded before and after RI, the cost looks even much better at 0.04). I will cut my loss if it goes below 20 % of 0.135.
MY Bonus will be the price of free warrant plus any price which is above 0. 135 per share. Currently my margin is a very very healthy margin.
You still have time to decide by looking at the price movement. Cut off date is 31st January 2020.
All the best."

这是翻译。这是最好的埃福德。希望团队可以在这里帮助我们的朋友。
为什么您在上个交易日之后的3天限制时间内上周没有出售您的母亲股份？您本可以收回部分费用。
供您参考，ICON股票在2014年至2018年间受到O＆G行业下滑的打击。所有O＆G参与者均受到打击。大多数小玩家已经不在了。该公司有20多艘船服务于马来西亚国家石油公司。当前的船只还不够，由于供应短缺，他们需要从外部外包。我预计2019年的业绩将比2018年好得多，因为将不会出现减值，因为他们已经在2018年将减值超过7000万。
ICON得到强大的主要投资者的支持，Equinas本身继续为该计划提供支持。所有银行都支持该计划，因为他们看到了该公司的未来。 Kenanga Research预计到2020年活动量将继续增长。对Petronas最新的《 2020-2022年活动展望》的解读主要是积极的，因为大多数上游价值链预计将在2019年保持大致水平，而他们中的一些人预计会激增。他们确定了最大的赢家，其中包括（i）制造商（例如SAPNRG，MHB），而井口平台（WHP）的数量几乎翻了一番，以及（ii）船舶制造商（例如ALAM，ICON ，PERDANA，COASTAL），而锚点处理拖船供应（AHTS）船只的数量激增。在Kenanga旁边，马来亚银行也对ICON给出了买入评级。
这是华尔街对ICON的评估。
奖赏
交易价格比其公允价值低93.1％。预计收入每年将增长116.6％。低于公允价值：ICON（MYR0.54）的交易价格低于我们的公允价值估计（MYR9.75）。预计ICON在未来三年内将实现盈利，这被认为比储蓄率（3.4％）更快。 ICON有望在未来3年内实现盈利。
风险分析
没有有意义的市值（MYR1600万）。过去三个月中股价波动很大
建议您根据您过去与该柜台的往来情况来制定自己的业务案例。
您的费用应涵盖所有购置费用以及RI转换费用。就我而言，我的ICON收支平衡成本为每股0.135（含RI）。任何高于这个价格的东西都会为我带来利润。 （仅供参考，如果我根据RI前后的总交易量来计算平均成本，则成本看起来更好，为0.04）。如果跌破0.135的20％，我将减少损失。
我的奖金将为免费认股权证的价格加上任何高于0. 135的价格。目前，我的保证金是非常非常健康的保证金。
您仍然有时间通过​​查看价格变动来决定。截止日期是2020年1月31日。
祝一切顺利。"

Not logic. The main reason for the proposed consolidation is to boost the price of the share, make it go into another class/ category of share, out from penny stock class.

First time I hear of such a thing. If there were no buyers how to be 'oversold'?
T+3 means the shares no longer in your control if you did not pick up. Means it will be forced sell at whatever price then. The loss will go towards your acct. Those shares that went into your CDS meant that you had some money in your brokerage to pick up when it became due. If you had money you should have given instructions to pick up earlier, then sell after that instead of waiting for the forced pick up.

Let's make it simple and easy I not sure whether this will be helping out a not since Icon is about to play tricky on us. I just found out a way to counter them but not sure it's work a not.
Example : Let's say the Icon Share Consolidate from 1,000 divide by 50 so you will be holding a 20 mother share and lost 1980 share on your hand.
The Price You Purchase before the ex-entitlement is RM 0.05 x 1000 = RM 50.00
So after the consolidate you just lost RM 49.00 and the total of your investment is RM 1.00
Ok....here is the important part of playing fields about the subscribe for the price of RM 0.105 x OR or Right Issue. So the top example is when you have a OR or Right Issue share that Icon given you is 2,000 share so this is the way how they trying to trap us to buy purchase RM 0.105 for 2000 = RM 210.00 and your previous investment was RM 49.00 so total will be RM 259.00 and they free extra 500 warrant for us and just to make us happy as well after that the price they will try to pump down below the right share price RM 0.105 we will be losing more.
So now I have call them on hold my bank draft which today i have already submit to them. If we play smart we will earning back from them again. let's say the price drop back to RM 0.05 your total investment will be RM 100.00 for the 2000 Mother Share when the price strike up we will be earning back all the things..If we don't greedy for the 500 warrant share."

确实，杰恩，
我所做的就是分享我所知道的。 没错，他们都应该心存感激，因为没有人实际将枪对准他们的头部强迫他们购买。 我的信息很清楚。
当ICON飞上天空直到一些猴子走向布尔萨抱怨时，这真是一个完美的天气。 通常布尔萨充耳不闻。 令人惊讶的是，这是一个例外。 这本可以是完美的练习。
每个人都应该足够聪明，可以自己决定。 否则，他们只需要继续前进即可。 我很惊讶这里有这么多婴儿。 我想我将在这里停止评论。

The price won't strike up if I am not wrong.
At least if we buy again when they strike RM 0.10 we sell we still earn each share RM 0.05 cent better than you subscribe for RM 0.105 if the price won't hit up more than that you will losing more. your previous investment and your new investment as i mention on the previous post.

I agree...
Based on my research,
TH has transferred 103 Million shares to Urusharta Jamaah. They were having 8.8% stakes in ICON. They were holding ICON for 4.5 Years with an average cost per share of RM 1.56. Their average investment cost is RM 161.6 Million.
Upon completion of transferred, they made a loss of RM 154.4 million which account to 95.5% Investments loss."

Yes steward I did take profits on the original OR both before the ex and after the ex date i.e last week during the 3 days limit up. Yes, I sold all the original Mother Shares. What's left now is the NEW OR.
With the NEW OR, my average cost based on my total number of shares that I have traded before ex date and after ex date, my cost is 0.04. So anything above this price, I should make a profits. In addition, I will get a free warrant.
If we benchmark with Alam after their exercise Alam is trading around 17.
Another motivation for me to take the RI offer is due to ICON Fundamental..
For your information, ICON shares been hammered by the downfall of O&G industry from 2014 until 2018. All O&G players were hit. Most small players are already gone. This company has more than 20 vessels serving Petronas. The current vessel is not enough and they need to outsource from outside due to shortage in supply. I expect 2019 result will be much better 2018 because there will be no impairment as they have already made the impairment more than 70 million in 2018.
ICON is backed by strong Major Investors and Equinas itself keep supporting ICON for this scheme. All banks also support the scheme because they see the future of this company. Kenanga Research are expecting to see a continuation of the elevated activity levels going into 2020. A read-through of Petronas’ latest Activity Outlook 2020-2022 was mostly positive, as most upstream value chains are expected to see approximately maintained levels from 2019, while several of them anticipated to see a surge. Of which, they have identified the biggest winners to include (i) fabricators (e.g. SAPNRG, MHB), with almost a doubling in the number of well-head platforms (WHP), and (ii) marine vessel players (e.g. ALAM, ICON, PERDANA, COASTAL), with a huge surge in the number of anchor handling tug supply (AHTS) vessels. Beside Kenanga, Maybank has also given a BUY Call on ICON.
Sharing my opinion here since you ask. It's not a BUY call. Please decide yourself when you have made a proper business case based on your respective previous trading. I have been playing with ICON since early last year.
All the best !

It is you can take charge of your fate, not letting others do and complain if the course not favouring your interest.

It is not the question of the RM 10 revenue I am sure cos it can be deducted during application. So anyone knows why e-rights are not popular here? It is mind boggling.

The shares that I have invested are mostly on long term. ICON being one of them but nobody expected a big counter to come out with this kind of crap proposal. If they can't even get this simple thing right, I have serious doubts what is going change in the future . To see your shares being taken away right under your sight and not able to do anything is already frustrating enough. They even got the gall to sell you back what was yours in the first place. That's really hurts. a BIG BIG disappointment with ICON. I am stuck with a huge amount of OR not sure whether I want to take up the rights. If I take up the rights , it will be more of a gamble for me cos I will dispose them once my losses are cut. I will not hold this counter for long term given this experience and their style of play."

I have shared my Business Case, why I decided to go in with the RI offer. Please scroll up.
Currently, there's so many parameters involved which makes it difficult to predict. If I can really see the future, I won't be here in the first place.
As example, Dow is down more than 600 points last night. I believe we will see more ripples as we progress.

I do not know who represent majority shareholder and how they think this can be profitable???? all CON man and dumb!
IbnuShaari,
I'm really sorry for your loss. Thanks for sharing your journey with ICON. I'm just curious why did you collect so much ICON shares knowing it went downhill from Jun 2014. Why didn't you cut your losses when the price was still high? What motivated you to keep this stock?
FYI, also I didn't vote for this Right Issues. In fact we did discuss about this subject sometime ago that those who can go to the AGM should vote for NO GO. No body reported back that on the outcomes. Only knew about this when someone posted on this Forum."

For much of 2019, it dropped to as low as 1,550 points before rebounding. This resulted in many having a view that Bursa Malaysia has a strong support level at 1,550 points.
However, on Thursday, this notion was erased.
The benchmark index closed at 1,545 points due to fears of the global economy slowing more than anticipated as a result of the impact of the coronavirus. The concerns are real because the coronavirus has caused China, which is the engine of growth for Asia, to come to a virtual standstill.
As of last Thursday, Bursa Malaysia was almost 18% lower compared to the highest point of 1,882 that was reached in June 2014. If Bursa Malaysia drops another 40 points to 1,505 points, we would technically be in a bear market, which by definition is a 20% drop from the peak."

Agree. For ICON, 3 years is the approximate expected time for ICON to recover based on Analyst Reports. I expect with the current Coronavirus issues, our KLCI will be in a limbo during the 1H20. We should be able to see some lights when we cross the 2H20. Of course, if ICON perform, why should we wait for 3 years. I will not hesitate to take profits. Likewise, cut loss.

Share consolidation of 50 shares at 3.5 sen each = RM1.75 prior at around the time the consolidation supposed to happen.
How come from RM1.75 straight drop to 42 sen on January 22? I thought buy sell should reflect the consolidated price & consolidated number of shares available.
Now at 25 sen only, it means market valuing it at 0.5 sen (per unconsolidated share). Before consolidation valued at 3.5 sen. What is this?"

Now there will be further shares to be issued to financiers called the Exchange Shares. These Exchange Shares will be issued 4 to 8 years from today.
Nonetheless, the number of Exchange Shares is estimated at 639,097,912. Thus the total possible financiers shares NOW is 327,573,863. And 4 to 8 years later (2023 to 2027), it will be 966,671,775, assuming the financiers have not sold their shares.
This is much less than the 2 billion shares mentioned to be financiers shares.
Really appreciate if one is to comment, please comment with correct fact.
Yes, 2,354,370,200 shares will be issued to all shareholders and this is 2x pre-consolidated 1,177,185,100 shares or 100x consolidated shares.
The major shareholders irrevocably undertake to subscript up to 1,385,714,285 (minimum) and 1,742,857,142 (maximum) i.e. RM 145.5 million to RM 183 million. Please do give due consideration to this undertaking.
The fear that the major shareholders and financiers will ""DUMP"" their shares on 20 Feb is IMHO, misplaced. Put yourself in their shoes - would you do it? There is the reputation at stake - after going through the hardship to raise fund just to dump the shares, especially the financiers - they will lose more than the amount of loan that was offset (by accepting shares in kind for RM 27.5 million NOW and RM 75.4 million 4 to 8 years later).
Now whether the O&G industry will ""tank"" or not, should be the main question to ask to determine whether to subscript or NOT if one is to ""invest"".
Also based on the minimum amount to be raised, RM 183 million, and main shareholders has agreed to come up with RM 145.5 million, ONLY RM 37.5 million need to be raised from retailers (you and me), i.e. ONLY 357,142,856 rights shares with 89,285,714 warrants. NOW, the ""dumping"" of shares would most likely be ONLY 357 million shares and NEVER ever be 2 billion shares.
Hopefully this put some perspective to the issue at hand.

1) Right issue with consolidation of 50 become 1 and followed by Right issue of 100 for 1.
2) Right issue. without consolidation of 50 become 1 and just 2 for 1.
The main reasons are as below
Assume a retail buyer owned 100,000 shares before consolidation of 50 become 1
, and his cost of investment = 100,000 x 0.035 = 3500
After consolidation of 50 become 1, if the retail buyer does not subscribe to the right issue and he sell his shares after ex date between 0.20 and 0.90, he can get back
a) ( 100,000 ÷ 50) x 0.20 = 400
b ) ( 100,000 ÷ 50) x 0.90 = 1800
so, he can only get back between 200 and 1800 only.
If he sell after the listing of right issue shares, may be he can only get back
( 100,000 ÷ 50) x 0.10 = 200 only.
So we can see that the retailer can only suffer loss. It means if the existing shareholders want to continue to play, they must pay new money to play the game.
2 ) if no consolidation of 50 become 1 and just right issue of 2 for 1 at 0.105 ( just leave free warrants issue aside). Most likely all the retailers will not subscribe for the Right issue, and the major shareholders, banks and the underwriters have to pay. Say the listing price after right issue completed is 0.10, the shareholders with 100,000 shares can sell all at 0.10 and get 10,000 campared with his original cost of investment of 3500, his gain is 185 % or
6500 ( 10,000 less 3500 ), in this case all the retailer buyers will be laughing."

Thank you for your insight.
I personally think that the current wuhan virus epidemic may hinder oil price, but its temporary. If you plot oil price against other major virus outbreak, there were relatively minor movement.
On new job orders, eventually Petronas will still need to roll out more new contracts. Their view is not for 1 year, but for the next five year. You cant draw oil in a day. Lol
But my final take is this is for the long run, you cannot flip this in a month."

After right issue, Icon is temporarily OK for the next few months to a year. The cost of investment for all shareholders are almost the same, i. e 0.105 less price of warrants.
So, after the listing of new right issue shares, if the retailers have the holding power and want to recover back their losses in this counter, they can average down if the price drops to 0.06 or 0.07 within the next few months."

Sorry friend, I'm definitely not the chosen one ... I'm just trying to learn.
As for my earlier comments, it was in reference to your earlier 2.28pm comments, the scenario 2, where there's no consolidation just a straight 2RI for 1 original share. Which is this one:
""2 ) if no consolidation of 50 become 1 and just right issue of 2 for 1 at 0.105 ( just leave free warrants issue aside). Most likely all the retailers will not subscribe for the Right issue, and the major shareholders, banks and the underwriters have to pay. Say the listing price after right issue completed is 0.10, the shareholders with 100,000 shares can sell all at 0.10 and get 10,000 campared with his original cost of investment of 3500, his gain is 185 % or
6500 ( 10,000 less 3500 ), in this case all the retailer buyers will be laughing.""
Help me understand why they need wait till RI is completed then only sell in such a scenario. Thanks!"
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800003587.jsp?ftp=147","Feb 7, 2020 11:11 PM","Shareview123","@ Carpophorus,
If the right issue is just 2 for 1 without shares consolidation , the Theoretically ex price will be
( 0.105 + 0.105 + 0.035) ÷ 3 = 0.0816667
( without taking into account the free warrants), it means the reference price on the first day after ex will be 0.08 ( rounding up).
Those who bought before ex date can only sell the 100,000 shares they have in their cds account. The 200,000 shares from the right issue can only be sold after right issues have been completed and the 200,000 shares have been credited to their Cds account which may take few weeks later."

Great sylvester89 !
That's exactly what I'm doing. Everybody deserve a 2nd chance, beside my current Business Case for ICON is good.
For your information, ICON shares been hammered by the downfall of O&G industry from 2014 until 2018. All O&G players were hit. Most small players are already gone. This company has more than 20 vessels serving Petronas. The current vessel is not enough and they need to outsource from outside due to shortage in supply. I expect 2019 result will be much better 2018 because there will be no impairment as they have already made the impairment more than 70 million in 2018.
ICON is backed by strong Major Investors and Equinas itself keep supporting ICON for this scheme. All banks also support the scheme because they see the future of this company. Kenanga Research are expecting to see a continuation of the elevated activity levels going into 2020. A read-through of Petronas’ latest Activity Outlook 2020-2022 was mostly positive, as most upstream value chains are expected to see approximately maintained levels from 2019, while several of them anticipated to see a surge. Of which, they have identified the biggest winners to include (i) fabricators (e.g. SAPNRG, MHB), with almost a doubling in the number of well-head platforms (WHP), and (ii) marine vessel players (e.g. ALAM, ICON, PERDANA, COASTAL), with a huge surge in the number of anchor handling tug supply (AHTS) vessels. Beside Kenanga, Maybank has also given a BUY Call on ICON.
Back to your Question,
For the OR, Mine is already in my Share Portfolio
For Free Warrant, it's still not in. But I'm sure it will be in the system by the listing date which is on the 20th February. From Serba Dinamik Right Issues Exercises, the warrant opens at 60 sen on the 1st day trading. Now it is trading about 40 with a Target Price of RM 1 by the end of this year.
Just call your IB or remiser. They can check it for you.

Hi, can please let me understand what has happened?
Share consolidation of 50 shares at 3.5 sen each = RM1.75 prior at around the time the consolidation supposed to happen.
How come from RM1.75 straight drop to 42 sen on January 22? I thought buy sell should reflect the consolidated price & consolidated number of shares available.
Now at 25 sen only, it means market valuing it at 0.5 sen (per unconsolidated share). Before consolidation valued at 3.5 sen. What is this?"

I want to relate this restructuring to Perdana, how is the performance of Perdana share after restructuring ?
Answer is good after restructuring.
Look at the share price of Perdana and Coastal, they are improving day after day. Business is growing in this sector.
I attended the meeting on Dayang 6 months ago, I was told there is not enough vessels to rent in the market. The rental price had increased nearly 20% in last 6 months. I do not know this scenario is still true or not.
Icon is ready to grasp this opportunity once the fund is there.
Icon does not need to start fresh, existing business is just nice in time.

A read-through of Petronas’ latest Activity Outlook 2020-2022 was mostly positive, as most upstream value chains are expected to see approximately maintained levels from 2019, while several of them anticipated to see a surge. Of which, they have identified the biggest winners to include:
(i) fabricators (e.g. SAPNRG, MHB), with almost a doubling in the number of well-head platforms (WHP),
(ii) marine vessel players (e.g. ALAM, ICON, PERDANA, COASTAL), with a huge surge in the number of anchor handling tug supply (AHTS) vessels.

Time will tell. From the 13 Battleships, only Silent Mary is currently registering negative margin.

Currently at 2.5 sen is still the cheapest Mother O&G shares in town.
I have already invest in 3 PN17 Companies
1. TH Heavy
2. Scomies
3. Barakah
TH Heavy has started moving. TH Heavy shot more than 30% on a single with one news and continue to maintain momentum. I'm not expecting anything less with Scomies and Barakah by Q2 this year.
Here is 11 Darn Good Reason why Barakah will not be delisted.
1. Focus on bidding for more projects - Estimated tender book value of RM928 million.
2. Execution of projects to sustain operations
3 Orderbook of RM600 million provides earnings visibility up to 2023.
4. Utilisation of pipe-lay barge KL101 - Currently on used by MCM contract, offshore of Terengganu
5. Collaborate with stronger companies
6. Strategic tie-up with Vallianz.
7. Collaboration with Minsheng.
8. To explore areas of collaboration
9. Actively disputing & taking legal action against Petronas lead by Chairman Zaid - RM1.02 billion demand against Petronas Carigali in August 2019.
10. Actively disputing & taking legal action against Petronas lead by Chairman Zaid - RM179.84 million from Petronas Gas Bhd, in relation to the procurement, construction and commissioning of Pengerang Gas Pipeline Project (formerly RGT2 Pipeline project).
11. Work in Progress to get out of PN17. Clear visibility that Barakah is actively working on improving their financials and business prospects.

An interesting omission is ""Enterprise"" Dayang. Care to share ""Sparrow"" views on this omission ....
15/02/2020 4:23 PM
I believe Serba Dinamik is a much stronger company than Dayang. Beside I have met Dato Karim in person during the AGM when we voted a GO decision for Bonus Issues, Share Split and Free Warrant exercises. It was one of the best AGM I have attended. It was swift, fast, effective and efficient. From the way they handle the AGM, I can see this company is very effective. Everything was over in less than 40 minutes. Dato Karim is really a pleasant person to talk to and he knows his trade very well. Everything he touches turns into Gold. You can see his other venture in KPower and SCIB also turns from Dust to Gold.
Currently Serba has secured Malaysian jobs of valued at around RM620 million. The overseas and Malaysian projects bring Serba Dinamik's contract wins so far this year to RM940 million and its latest orderbook to RM10.7 billion. Management’s internal target stands at RM15 billion by end-2020. They are making no changes to their earnings forecasts as these contracts fall under our replenishment target for the year.
Here's their track records.. It's a growing company..
2017: RM5.3B
2018: RM7.5B
2019: RM10.0B
2020: The group is targeting an order book of about RM15B.
I have nothing against Dayang. It's just that I have to make a prioritization for my Tier 1 Battleship. When I entered Serba it was trading above RM 4 plus and its the most expensive Battleship. I have bought in 5 different batches before the Bonus Issues, Share Splits and Free Warrant exercises. I have a very good and pleasant experience with Serba exercise which motivate me to subscribe the whole of ICON Right Issues. As you can see, I was rewarded beautifully. Serba is currently sitting on P1 on my list of 13 battleships. I'm still keeping Serba. It's one of those counter which I seldom monitor as I know she is in good hand with competence and able leader like Dato Karim.
I noticed that my name was quoted in Dayang when the Dayang Team were bashing that infamous character who claims he make millions in Penta. FYI Penta is one of my collection under Technology sector for my Digital Economy Boutique..
All the best to your Dayang.

1. Alam Maritim Resources Berhad, an investment holding company, provides marine transportation support services in Malaysia.
REWARDS
Trading at 83.2% below its fair value
Earnings are forecast to grow 116.3% per year
2. ICON Offshore Berhad, an investment holding company, provides offshore support vessels to the oil and gas related industries in Malaysia, Brunei, and Thailand.
REWARDS
Trading at 97.6% below its fair value
Earnings are forecast to grow 116.6% per year
A read-through of Petronas’ latest Activity Outlook 2020-2022 was mostly positive, as most upstream value chains are expected to see approximately maintained levels from 2019, while several of them anticipated to see a surge. Of which, they have identified the biggest winners to include:
(ii) marine vessel players (e.g. ALAM, ICON, PERDANA, COASTAL), with a huge surge in the number of anchor handling tug supply (AHTS) vessels.
OTB also shared that he attended an Investment and was told there is not enough vessels to rent in the market. The rental price had increased nearly 20% in last 6 months.
There's enough money on the table. That's why the People in the BoardRoom were smiling when our Young and Upcoming Star sylvester89 was the 1st to submit his application.
Mine was done by my Investment Banker. Otherwise, those people in the Boardroom will be smiling at me too..
Next one coming in the Pipelines is Vangelis Scomies. They will do a similar consolidation exercise by the end of this Month. Remember what happened to ICON once they starts consolidating their shares? What happened during those 3 days limit up? One of the investors managed to reward himself with a brand New SLK...

No point being a cry baby. What has happened cannot be undone. So don't blame everything on markets, other traders or bad luck. At the end of the day, you are making the investments.
For me, it’s still too early to make any assessment as this new ships has just been refurbished. Her journey has just begun. We will know what will happen from tomorrow onward.
For those that bought today and have sell. Well done. You did great considering the sudden change on the listing date by 2 days from 20th to 18th February.
Remember, the right Issue price is 10.5 Sen. If you have not trade earlier on this counter, this should be your cost to monitor. Set your cut loss limit for your respective ICONs.
As shared by Shareview, from the operator perspective..
Let say 25 % of the total shares issued are from retailers.
= 2.3 billion x 25 % = 575 million are in the hands of the retailers, if they push up 10 sen, they have to pay additional 57.50 million, if they push up 20 sen, they will have to pay additional of 115 million.
So, this is something you have to keep in mind when managing your cost. As I shared earlier, if we bench marked ICON with her competitors in the trade, they are trading at the following price.
Perdana Price: RM 0.47
Coastal Price: RM 1.33
Alam Price: RM 0.15
I'm prepared to go all the way to 3 years if ICON can get up to speed. Anything less to reach our destination is another Bonus for all of us NEW SHAREHOLDERS.

Another thing is I have never experienced about a change of the listing date brought forward by 2 days on Monday after designated Share Uplift on Friday evening.
There's too many first time here. I can see some similarities with my first night entering our bedroom after a gracious wedding ceremony in the evening after all our guest have left.
As the saying goes, ""there are bedrooms you like to remember and others you would like to forget. Serba Dinamik is something I will remember for a lifetime as it was effectively done. Even Revenue exercise was great.

OTB idiot probably got stuck speculating in this 12 cent shit prior to designation. Thats why rosy flowery comments just prior to todays free fall. Just another OTB screw up after the recent screw up in carimin. He came out apologising like an asshole then. Now this asshole keeping quiet oredy. Stop lar following this stupid idiot.

Ans :
You think that you can con me to buy this stock.
Check my records and I am not so stupid like you.
rr88,
Unlike you, you are a big liar in I3.
You are very poor and pretend to be rich.
You are not a lawyer and pretend to call yourself a lawyer.
You do not have money to buy Penta, still claim that you made > 3 million.
You do not hold any share, how can you make > 3 million in Penta.
You do not have a good record in I3 especially in Dayang forum.
You do not do your homework and simply assume without facts and figures.
You had been wrong all the times.
Do you feel shame on yourself to tell lies here ?
God knows !!

Not really..
Since I subscribed to the whole right issues, I'm loaded with it in my Share Portfolio. So I'm releasing some of my ICON Royal Fortunes holding to make way for my MyEG Fast & Furious. I believe MyEG will move faster compare to ICON. FYI, MyeG share current price rally is driven by shareholders’ optimism that MyEG could secure the contracts for the foreign visa system (VLN) and the Integrated Immigration System (IIS). MyEG is my Top 3 Contibutors in the Tech Sector.
I managed to sell it way above my ICON Holding cost at 13 sens. Royal Fortunes has now moved from P11 to P8 on my Armada Fleets of 13 battleships. My margin looks beautiful now. This latest exercises is certainly good for me. I have not even touch the warrant yet which was given free as part of this right issue.
Dicky, I'm waiting patiently to buy your AA shares at RM 1.

Liar rr88, you do not have money to buy 1.6 million of Penta shares.
Liar rr88, you cannot even afford 1,600 shares of Penta.
Liar rr88, you stay in low cost house, you use public bus as your transportation vehicle.
Liar rr88, you are a contra kaki because you do not have money to pick up share.
Liar rr88, you are shouting ""sell"" all the times, you cannot keep Penta for 3 years.
Liar rr88, you are bullshitting to be a rich person, but you are a poor person.

I only read 1 free warrant for every 4 right issues.
rr88 is telling lies here again.
Never trust this liar.
He does not have any money to pick up share, he is a contra kaki.
Can he make million in trading of share ?
Answer is no.
He is a liar and he is as poor as a beggar.

BullRun_93 [rr88] Now i tell you whats going on. These bankers now sitting on 36% profit with billions shares on hand. Their cost 0.125. Market rates 0.12 mother plus 0.05 free warrants = 0.17. (0.17 - 0.125)/0.125 = 36%. For bankers anything more than fd rates, they take it. For 8-15% profit its very good. For 36% profit, its super jumbo good. Thats why sellers happy2 to sell today 0.12 - 0.13.

If u have it at high prices, just pray or cut loss when u can stomach the pain.
Now it's time to play at low prices cos all the limit up/down story/pain over.
Time to make money from the syndicates/stockists at these low prices. Yes it may go lower but look at the bright side.......it can't limit down any more .
I'm betting it will slowly move up when new contracts come out or when the company start making profit again. Stay tuned

But the path to profitability is always not easy. It need to produce at least a few qtr of profits. Otherwise it will drop below the RI price. We are looking at below 10.5 minus warrant price.
Eventually warrant will be 1 sen.
So we could witness 9 sen or even 7 sen before any significant upwards price.
Pls note velesto was also like that. The uptick in velesto came only after few qtr of profit. It was at 22 sen once. Sapnrg is at the same spot as velesto previously. Good time to enter anyway for bravehearts. Icon is now at sapnrg just after the RI. Full of hope before despair. I would wait for the euphoria to clear first before moving in.

I've been to Holland, the men there are more handsome and polite than you. Hence I have no issue going to Holland.
I have already locked my profits today and have not even touched my warrant yet. I'm prepared to ride all the way to be part of this company future success story. Alam has done it, Perdana has done it Coastal has done it. It's time for ICON to join the bandwagon.
This is exactly what you did with Greatec last year. After you sold off your share at 0.80 sen. You said many nasty thing about Greatec and calling everyone Idiots. If you can read your technical chart, you could have detected this already. Greatec has reached an all time high of RM 3.49 last week. Those that stay with me in Greatec has already made more than 500% Profits.

OTB said If you believe this business sector is still good, right issue is a good move to help this company to turn to profitability.
===> Rights issue over subscribed by 19% means investor willing to take up all rights and most excess share applicant couldn't even get them. Is this not good sign for ICON? Mr.[rr88] are you dreaming?
Hey! [rr88] nobody ask you to chase the stock when it shoot up to $0.535 those syndicate who push the price up mainly to bait dumb investor and you stand up for those dumb investor?? Why so stupid and blame OTB somemore? Did he ask you to buy all the way to $0.535? All he said was take up the rights which later proven after listing everyone make 30% profit.

Wow...
TanDavid88,
Penta is currently siting on P4 under my Technology Portfolio in term of Margin after Greatec, My EG and Revenue.
Penta is like Serba Dinamik. It's one of the most expensive stocks in the Tech sectors with good fundamental. Usually I placed this kind of stock under Category 3 meaning BUY and FORGET..
Both are well managed companies with good fundamental. For this type of companies, I seldom trade. I just keep it in my collection and grow with these companies.

Yo sylvester89...
Helping a family in needs is very commendable. You will reap what you sow. Trust me..
I did something similar building a building for an Orphanage and just recently a clinic to serve the Kampung Folks in a rural area somewhere in the East Coast. For this one I worked with a team of Doctors..
Back to your question, if I can predict the future, I would not be here. I don't want to give a wrong buy call and later being bash by an idiot who has nothing to do but bashing people all over the place.
There are many forecast already given by the team in this forum. Pick one of them that suit you. All I can say is this, there are many interesting bargain out there. Looks for company with good fundamentals. However if you still like to be part of this company's success story, I would wait for the upcoming QR before buying further into this company.
Market is currently is on retracement so you got nothing to lose to wait. If it goes up after the this coming QR you can still buy when this stock is trending. It's still one of the cheapest O&G Stock in the market. If it goes down further, you already profits from selling all your holding yesterday. I did the same yesterday. I sold half of OR Holding at 13 sen since I subscribed the whole RI and with abundance of free warrants.
All the best..

Yo sylvester89...
Helping a family in needs is very commendable. You will reap what you sow. Trust me..
I did something similar building a building for an Orphanage and just recently a clinic to serve the Kampung Folks in a rural area somewhere in the East Coast. For this one I worked with a team of Doctors..
A:Cool it's really nice to meet someone like you.
Back to your question, if I can predict the future, I would not be here. I don't want to give a wrong buy call and later being bash by an idiot who has nothing to do but bashing people all over the place.
A: I understand how you feel when someone is bashing you or the other people. No worry I will study further about the market.
There are many forecast already given by the team in this forum. Pick one of them that suit you. All I can say is this, there are many interesting bargain out there. Looks for company with good fundamentals. However if you still like to be part of this company's success story, I would wait for the upcoming QR before buying further into this company.
A:Of course I would like to join a part of this company but not now yet will be soon after I got back my money.lol
Market is currently is on retracement so you got nothing to lose to wait. If it goes up after the this coming QR you can still buy when this stock is trending. It's still one of the cheapest O&G Stock in the market. If it goes down further, you already profits from selling all your holding yesterday. I did the same yesterday. I sold half of OR Holding at 13 sen since I subscribed the whole RI and with abundance of free warrants.
A: Cool will be seeing you again soon xD thanks for many advise because I know this company won't be down so easily like scomie that pariah counter make me loss for the first time. Hahaha....so if the QR almost arrive I hope to get more information from u xD and the others as well.
Have a nice weekday and It's my pleasure to meet you and the other as well in my life.
Thanks everyone!! Meow Meow!!"

1. Buy and Engage - short to mid term
2. Buy and Hold - mid to long term
3. Buy and Forget - long term
ICON is currently under Category 1.
For Category 3 companies, I seldom trade. Once I am done with initial trading to lock my profit, I just keep it in my collection and grow with these companies. This companies includes Penta, Serban Dinamik, Hartalega, Top Gloves, Kossan, TM, Digi, Axiata, Gamuda, KLCC, IGB REITS, SUNREIT, PAVREIT etc etc.. Greatec used to be 1.

Do you know that Britney Spears does not use any under wear?
In this modern age, most women seldom use it. Here's why.
1. It's comfortable.
The number one reason is that it's, honestly, really comfortable. It's just you, your private and your pants getting to know each other better, hanging out like old friends, sipping glasses of wine.
2. Can actually help prevent infections.
If you have lots of itching and irritation down there, gynecologists actually recommend you skip wearing underwear. Vaginas are already moist, so adding a layer of suffocation (in the form of underwear) can actually make things worse. If your private is constantly covered, more moisture collects down there, which cultivates an ideal environment for yeast growth. And since the risk of yeast infections among humans has actually been increasing, it might be a good idea to start without it.
3. You'll feel sexier.
That little secret you have with yourself will totally up your confidence. Let your boyfriend know you're not wearing any underwear and watch his lust for you skyrocket. You can up the ante by whispering it in his ear in a public place where he can't do anything about it just yet. You will officially become the only thing on his mind all night.
There’s many more, but I think I just stop here.

TheEdge Thu, Feb 20, 2020 10:52pm - 55 minutes ago
KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 20): Urusharta Jamaah Sdn Bhd, the government’s special-purpose vehicle (SPV) set up to manage Lembaga Tabung Haji's underperforming assets, has resurfaced as Icon Offshore Bhd’s substantial shareholder.
An exchange filing today showed 132.86 million Icon shares, derived from the offshore support vessel provider’s rights issue, were added to Urusharta Jamaah’s shareholding.
With this, Urusharta Jaamah’s shareholding in Icon rises to 133.80 million shares, representing a 5.63% direct stake as of writing. The SPV had last month ceased to be Icon’s substantial shareholder, after disposing of 972,225 shares.
Urusharta Jamaah was among those who voted for the cash call last November, an exercise to raise up to RM250 million, alongside a plan to restructure some RM577 million of Icon’s debts to reduce its gearing from 9.16 times to under 1.4 times.
Icon unit Hallmark Odyssey Sdn Bhd’s controlling shareholder, Hallmark Odyssey Sdn Bhd (owned by Ekuiti Nasional Bhd or Ekuinas), had also given an undertaking to subscribe up to RM183 million of the rights issue.
Following the subscription of ordinary shares, pursuant to the rights issue of shares with warrants, Hallmark Odyssey owned a direct 57.406% stake in Icon.
Icon's share price has halved from Friday (Feb 14)’s closing of 23.5 sen to close at its all-time low of 11.5 sen today, after 23.78 million shares were done. Bloomberg data showed Icon is now valued at a market capitalisation of RM273.5 million.

TDM is one of my selection for my Plantation Boutique. Just like Icon, it's the cheapest stock among my selection of 10 Plantations.

Beside KLSE, I have also invested in Technology Stocks in Nasdaq. One of them has 40% of World 5G Deployment across the Globe.
For KLSE, I have 4 Boutiques
Plantation
O&G
Digital Economy
Visit Malaysia Year.
All these companies under these 4 Boutiques give me the pulse of our economy. Current performance in term of margin:
P1 - Plantation
P2 - Oil & Gas
P3 - Digital Economy
P4 - Visit Malaysia Year 2020
It’s just like an F1 Race between Mercedes Benz, Ferrari, Red Bulls and Maclaren.
Since everyone is so concern about CoronaVirus, come and join me in the Glove industry. Malaysia is donating 18 million gloves to China. It's time to give back some of our winning. I just added Kossan last week to my Gloves holding to join her elder sisters Hartalega and Top Gloves. China will have all the masks they need to contain the Coronavirus...cats included...
Glove Industry is rated OVERWEIGHT by various IB..Very Bullish and has been climbing since the CoronaVirus struck. Currently the shares of these stocks in under retracement, hence it's an opportunity to collect.
I'm also watching AA closely. If you look at the 15mins Chart AirAsia may break down
If AA breakdown RM1.00, it might go below RM0.80. - RM0.85
I'm still waiting patiently at RM 1.00 ....

There you go again telling lies.
I want everyone to read this so that you all know about this idiot who claim to be a smart trader.
Let me get the facts straight. On that very day when ICON reached 0.523, we see two things happening, stock limit up then limit down in single day. This has never happened before in my trading life. Third, the Operator change the listing date brought forward by 2 days on Monday after designated Share Uplift on Friday evening on a very short notice. It was only announced around 1500 hrs. Once this was known many investors starts panic selling. Many got caught with their pants down. I only came to know about this through this forum as I away that day.
This ICON Right Issues Exercise is the most Controversial Exercises I have come across. With the changes of the listing date at short notice, many got really burned. The biggest losers are those that bought in on Monday expecting another limit up the following day. That mean when T+ 2 come they got no money to pick up at their wanted price. The price on the following day were scaled down since the major players has unload their share during the Monday Limit Up.
It's pretty clear that this OPERATOR who managed the share exercise for ICON is really nasty. This is the 1st time I see something like this where they can just change the listing date just by a flick of a finger. Hence, we need to be aware of this as we progress with our journey on this ship.
rr88 only came into the picture when he see this limit up. Before this he was never here except during the 3 days limit up to bash everyone here. He was not helping at all with his abusive language.
Sorry to disappoint you rr88. We will look more beautiful from now on. Beside ICON who will be paying for my dance lesson, my Body Shop will now finance all my makeup from now on..

For ICON Case, you are dead wrong. My mother shares are sitting on a healthy margins. Warrants does not cost me a penny to hold for next 8 years. My ICON Royal Fortune is now sitting on P8 in my Fleets of 13 battleships.
Trees that are slow to grow always bear the best fruits.
I have been a strong advocate as a long-term investor. So far it works for me. In some cases, I also do like what you are doing. Money is not everything to me, All these companies gives me pulse how our economy are doing.
I would like to encourage everyone to start asking this question. what percent of contra traders are successful?
Nobody knows the exact %, but according to insiders who trade, it’s probably closes between 1-5%. If you are not mentally and emotionally prepared to lose money, you will never make money and this is why 95% are not successful. You can NOT be afraid to lose money.
Most associate losing with failure. They equate success to winning more trades than losing trades. They ignore what matters most; the size of the wins, not the frequency of the wins. A trader can win 1/3 of their trades and make millions, if they know what they are doing. They need to follow and understand a simple formula.
(avg win RM) x (win %) must be greater than (avg loss RM) x (lose %)
Your goal is to increase your win amount, not win % and reduce your loss amount, not your lose frequency. If you make 10 trades and lose RM 1 on 8 of those trades, you only need to make RM 4 on the other 2 trades to break even. You could lose 80% or not lose any money (ignoring fees obviously).
However, since rr88 don’t own any shares what is there to talk about? From what I can see from your track record in Greatec and myeg which you proudly announce before you delete it, your holding range is 1-3 cents. This doesn’t sound like much considering 95% of these contra traders lose money. Like I said, earlier, if you have listen to me in Greatec you could make RM 2.81 per share instead of just 3 sen.

Now I understand why you keep telling everyone that you are rich, very rich. Your very uptight and abusive behaviors explained everything.
Look at Bill Gates one of the most Wealthy People on earth, he does not go around bashing people. He helped people and make this world a better place. He contributed. Lastly but not least, he does not go around telling the whole world that he is rich, Very Rich...

the only explanation as to why this [rr88] attack both of you viciously is that this [rr88] might have been your paid subscriber for your stock tips service and lost big money. No sane human would attack ppl like this. i'm not selling anything or provide any paid service here so no matter what this [rr88] said about me does not affect me. But to both of you it can affect you because newbie wouldn't know the whole story and might cost you losing subscribers. So you guys are kept busy explaining over & over again about his lies. I mean this is life you will always have disgruntled customer who want your business to go down.
For sure this [rr88] is a day trader who make Lobster dinner money. He will never make big money. He will have to stay in front of the computer for the rest of his life looking at chart. If he stops the money flow will also stop. If he wants this kind of lifestyle no problem but someday when he ages he will have to stop anyway.
Looking at his stetement i can guess this guy is an uneducated arrogant chinese educated full of hatred type of guy. Messing with these kind of human being in real world is totally out of the question.

Touche Bullrun you are spot on. I totally agree with your conclusion about rr88. That's why we should not let him get away this time. He has abusive a lot of people in the past and causing them losing a lot of opportunity to make money.
Just a small correction. In my case, I don't do subscription. I give my advice Free of Charge to those that need it in a forum where I put my stakes in it. I usually do my homework before I put my money in my adventures. I don't do classes. It's part of my giving back.
This is not only I thing I do to give back. Charity has also been on my agenda. Beside donation to NGO, I usually support orphanage and under privilege children. We even build a building for them. This year I have collaborate with a team of Doctors to build Clinic to serve the kampung folks somewhere in a remote village in East Coast.

The outlook for bursa is not good. This is simply because the US markets are in bubble over-valuation territory now. It has been 11 yrs since the Dow embarked on this spectacular run from the crash of sub-prime mortgage crisis of 2008 bringing it up from mind boggling 8,000 to 29,000 now.
Some high performers there showing sharp parabolic move such as Microsoft from usd24.00 to 180.00 and Amazon from usd80.00 to 2,000.00.
Previously, the economic expansion periods only lasted for 10 yrs and followed by contraction n sharp decrease in stock prices. Now it has gone beyond that which means the end of the party there is imminent.
The thing is when the Dow moved up, we came down. What will happen when the Dow comes down? Obviously, we will go down much lower.
However, some pockets of good upward moves were seen in local oil & gas stocks with industry recovery theme play. But this is ending now.
Knm has retreated sharply from 0.46 peak to 0.26 and clearly showing its inability to recover from this level. Same thing for Armada from 0.58 down to 0.35 and now struggling to move back up past 0.40. Carimin has come off peak of 1.44. Similarly, Alam is off peak of 0.195.
The only one hovering at its peak is Dayang. This soon will come to an end with its just announced disappointing QR result.
While it is sad to see some investors got trapped in this Icon hu-ha, it is sadder to know that these investors will suffer more because this oil & gas short-lived recovery is bubbling away now.

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800003587.jsp?ftp=162","Feb 23, 2020 11:01 AM","Mabel","Yes, US stock market has been having a bull run since 2009. One of my Technology Stocks in Nasdaq has given me an ROI of 70% over a 4 years span. This company has 40% Market share of 5G Deployment across the Globe.
Within Malaysia, almost all segments of the economy have been under pressure for the whole of last year. The property sector continued to be in the doldrums while interest rates started to come down again, causing yields from fixed income instruments such as government bonds to drop. As at the end of 2019, Bursa Malaysia’s leading index – FBMKLCI – was down 4.7% compared to the start of the year. Fortunately, my total average ROI and Margin for my 4 Boutiques
1. Plantation
2. Oil &Gas
3. Digital Economy
4. Visit Malaysia Year)
are healthy for both. This mean, my selection has outperformed the KLCI Index.
We talked about EPF yesterday. As of December, last year, the writing was on the wall that the EPF would declare modest dividends. The strongest signal came when PNB declared its lowest ever dividend of 5.5% for its flagship fund, ASB, for 2019. Considering ASB’s returns, the dividend of 5.45% declared by EPF for contributors of the conventional fund is commendable.
The reason for the low returns of the provident fund is due to the poor performance of the capital markets as a whole – within Malaysia and overseas. Unlike PNB, the EPF has placed a meaningful portion of its funds under management outside the country. In the past, EPF’s returns from investments overseas have performed well and provided the cushion to make up for the modest returns it gets from the money put within the country. However, for 2019, the EPF did not have the buffer as capital markets as a whole were ravaged due to the US-China trade war.
Some 70% of EPF’s funds of RM924.75bil is invested in Malaysia, which means the performance of the local capital markets has a major bearing on its returns. The bulk of the money within Malaysia is placed in risk-free government debt papers which provide low yields of about 3% or lower. The EPF is a major investor in the local stock market but the money is spread within less than 200 out of the 1,000 listed companies. The reason is that most of the listed companies on Bursa Malaysia do not meet EPF’s stringent investment criteria.
EPF’s returns from its investments overseas have been good and made up for the poor returns it gets from the money put in the domestic markets. That is the reason why even though Bursa Malaysia and the ringgit have been languishing since 2014, the EPF has been able to give splendid returns of more than 6%.
Going forward, the year started on a bad footing. Even the US markers are affected by the Covid-19 epidemic while oil prices are under still pressure. Malaysia’s economic growth is expected to be lower than last year – at least for the first six months. Hence, it will be prudent to take necessary action. The coming QR should be a good indicator to act accordingly.
Using Professor Dicky commendable achievements below as my benchmark…

Based on current prevailing price, Greatec has an ROI of 378%, KNM an ROI of 170% and Armada an ROI of 167%.

Icon is sitting on P8 in my Armada Fleets of 13 Battleships.
Since Ncm88 mentioned about Ikhmas. my ROI is -56%. However, I have cut my losses but still maintain some of holding since this is the company that has piling capability in my collection of 7 Construction companies. I could go for an alternative however during the time of entry their Value Proposition were very attractive with 800 Million Contracts in their stable plus ECRL which was speculated at that time. I will take necessary after the QR. The Construction sector still compliment my Visit Malaysia Year Program. -

Just look at the number of projects they won in the past months, every single month they win at least one project (we have never seen this kind of announcement in the past). Go and dig out the entire KLSE, how many companies are able to secure so many international grade projects in the past 11 months
KNM is not like any ordinary companies, KNM owns 100% of BORSIG. BORSIG is a proven world class German Engineering company, one of the best in the world. They may not show much in the past few years, it does not mean they will not show more in the future. One fact that nobody can deny is that, BORSIG has the ability to compete against anyone n the world. Competitive Edge in very important in any business... and KNM has it with BORSIG.
Those projects are not all that is KNM has more income sources than these new projects in 2019 (until Nov).
23rd Jan 2019 USD 6.8 million RM28.17mil (Bahrain)
13th Feb 2019 USD 6.48 Million RM26.38mil (Switzerland)

18th Oct 2019 RM 51.48 million (Algeria)
13th Nov 2018 RM21.521 million (Thailand)
Total new projects for 2019 = RM646.548 mil
in addition to that, in 2019, we also have...
1. Sales of BORSIG ZM, RM130 million
2. Revenue from BORSIG GROUP (based on historical results, this one should be at least RM 1 billion)
3. Revenue from Impress Ethanol (should be at least RM150 million)
4. Balance from old projects (not sure, lazy to dig)
5. Parts and maintenance job by other KNM subsidiaries (not sure, lazy to dig )
After the item 1 to 3, the balance item 4 and 5 lazy to dig, With just 1 to 3 plus all the new projects, KNM revenue is more than enough for this year.
As for risk, KNM only have RM1.5 billion borrowings, even Impress Ethanol alone will worth more than RM1.5 billion by now (fully operational). Peterborough WTE is worth at least RM2 billion. What risk do you have? We don’t even need to look at BORSIG. If you insist must look at BORSIG...

Yes RGTECH figures and service products are very similar to my Revenue.
- Stronger FY2019 32% higher revenue than FY2018
- net profit surge 94.8% on greater adoption of retail technology
- 3,500 suppliers registered to AX Retail B2B as at end-2019
- All 7-eleven Malaysia stores total 2,323 outlets are adopting usage of AX Retail B2B portal
- MSC Malaysia Status
- International Business Partners: Honeywell, Pricer, HP, Datalogic and etc.
Currently, Revenue is one of my Top 3 Contributors in the Tech sector together with Greatec and Penta. The above looks very attractive and certainly deserve my further attention.

Price climbs 6 % yesterday. Next will be my P2 Black Pearl Battleship (Armada) announcing the same feats soon. Both are now complete successful turnaround stories. Based on current prevailing price, KNM has an ROI of 170% and Armada an ROI of 167%.
...and the Winner is my P1 Serba Interceptor Battleship. Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd turned in another set of record high earnings in the financial year ended Dec 31, 2019 (FY19). Its annual net profit soared to RM496.64 million on revenue of RM4.53 billion.
The record high annual earnings was driven by 26.9% growth in its quarterly net profit in its fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2019 (4QFY19) to RM140.88 million from RM112.87 million in the year-ago quarter. Quarterly revenue increased 37.9% to RM1.36 billion from RM978 million in 4QFY18, on improvements across all three of its main segments.
Serba Dinamik declared a fourth interim single-tier dividend of 1.4 sen for FY19 payable on March 30, bringing total dividends for the year to 7.51 sen per share.
I'm looking forward to see another great result from P8 Royal Fortune ICON Battleship soon..

27/02/2020 11:46 PM
Thanks for this question. This is Maybank latest assessments..
Raised TP to MYR0.11; D/G to HOLD
Excluding the one-offs in 4Q19, results were in line with our estimates. While we raise our earnings estimates (123%-150%) and TP (+22% to MYR0.11, rolling over valuations to FY21, at an unchanged 10x PER (5year mean) post the debt restructuring exercise, Icon is fairly priced for now, in our view. HOLD.
One-offs skewed 4Q19, break-even quarter
Headline net profit of MYR11m in 4Q19 comprised MYR11m one-offs, arising from the reversal of impairment on vessels (+MYR12m), which partly offset impairment on receivables (-MYR1m). Excluding that, Icon marginally broke-even in the quarter. This took its FY19 core net loss to MYR18m, in line with our initial FY estimate (-MYR17m). The QoQ strength was fuelled by higher OSV utilization (59% vs. 58% in 3Q19). Overall, it achieved a lower OSV utilization average of 53% in FY19 vs. 56% in FY18.
Earnings adjustment
We raise our FY20-21 core net profit to MYR25m-29m (from MYR10m13m) and introduce FY22’s earnings (MYR38m), taking into account the interest savings (MYR18m p.a.) post its debt restructuring exercise (i.e. 100 rights-for-every 1 share, debt-to-equity swap), which would raise its share base to 2.6b shares (+124%). Consequently, it will recognise a MYR27m one-off gain from this exercise.
Fairly priced in
While we remain positive on Icon’s debt-restructuring proposal to recapitalise its balance sheet, the positives have been priced in, from a valuations perspective. At current juncture, Icon is fairly valued, in our view. Nevertheless, while the OSV market has bottomed, utilisation is progressively rising. An uptick in DCR is a catalyst

There are two stocks which is hot today; EDEN and THRIVEN. Both are linked to TSMY. I decided to go for EDEN. Thriven I decided to put on hold since it is a Property Company and I have already 7 Strong Property Companies under my collection.

Thank you.
07/03/2020 9:57 PM
It will be my pleasure OTB
Here’s my collection of Technology stocks and they are ranked in term of margin. All of them are profitable.
1. MyeG
2. Revenue
3. Greatec
4. Penta
5. Istones
6. PIE Industry
7. Inari
8. UWC
9. VS Industry
10. Elsoft
All of them are great. However, if I have to pick 3, I will pick the following:
1. MyEG
MyEG has been my Top 3 Contributors in the Tech Sector. Despite it's up and down this share has never failed to impress me. It's one of the counters that I seldom visit since she knows how to care of herself.
Here’s my checklist
1. Increased earnings over time? ... PASS
2. Converting sales to profits? ... PASS
3. Increased shareholder value? ... PASS
4. Pays a cash dividend? PASS
5. Stock currently undervalued? ... PASS
6. Potential higher earnings this year compare to last year? .... PASS
Growth spurred by aggressive tailwinds in high population countries Philippines, Indonesia, and Bangladesh. With gross margin at 50% consistently past few years, profits would need to tank 50% in order to make a loss. And risk of that happening is lower than 5% for me as government services is a sticky business and has high cost of change.
At current price of 1.14, this is hugely attractive for medium-long term investors with significant margin of safety of at least 50% in my view. With a DCF valuation of 20% growth and PE of 20, I value MYEG at 2-year horizon: rm1.90/share5-year horizon: rm3.30/share.
This week, the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) board has re-emerged as a substantial shareholder in MyEG Services Bhd, over a year after it ceased as the e-government service provider's substantial shareholder in December 2018. This comes after EPF bought 3 million MyEG shares on Wednesday (March 4), which raised its share tally in MyEG to 173.66 million shares, representing a 5.013% stake.
2. Greatec and/or Penta
Under Budget 2020, tax incentives will be provided to promote high-value added activities in the E&E industry to transition into 5G digital economies and IR4.0. Hence, we anticipate more companies to embrace for automation, potentially resulting in higher demand for automation-related services companies. Under this space, lookout for stocks related to automation such as PENTA, GREATEC and ISTONE as we believe their services may be in interest moving forward.
3. Inari
I have always love anything to do with Apple. Inari, the supplier to Apple recently reported it's 38 Consecutive Profits recently. Inari stock are so much related to United States, Broadcom NYSE developments since it supplies Apple component.
Apple is very smart. It created a distinctive operating system. Once a customer is converted to Apple's environment, he or she is likely to stay for good. It's Apple legacy to produce something superior than others. That's way it's always late in rolling out its new generation of devices. Many ppl know it well but still worry when Apple's sale drops in short-term. It is taking time to create a winner. Apple will find the most strategic timing to launch it's most superior 5G iPhone.
The reason why it is sitting in P7 is because of my accumulation. Whenever you buy, your margin drops. When you sell margin improve. That's how it works.
As always, please also do your diligence before taking the plunge..
All the best !

Wah....Good morning Michael....
Didn't know you love me so much. You seems to be following me wherever I go.
Mabel is just an an ordinary gal who has passion for Investments. She would love to tap the knowledge from great investors like OTB and anyone else who are willing to shares. It's a Life Long Learning.
When you asked me for opinion, I gave it gladly. Likewise I do the same for everyone else including our learned OTB. Even our Bill Gates and our PM do seek opinion from others from time to time. A good example is what we did in this Forum. I picked up a lot of things from the dialogues in this forum from everyone here.
Absolutely, This is exactly what I'm doing. Don't sailang in one go as the worst is still not over yet..
One thing that we need is for the market to recover in V SHAPE mode. Than it will be something. If the recovery is slumber land..we will be in trouble...but historically if we compare to SARS..the recovery was so fantastic..it was V SHAPE recovery..
Currently, COVID 19 is about media headlines only..once the media change the mode to positive news such as vaccine found , China successfully contain the virus , USA successfully contain the virus , Europe successfully contain the virus then on top of all interest rate cuts aggressively by Federal Reserve mid March 2020, then market start to change its gear for positive mode.
Latest we can see Friday Dow Jones only loss 300 points compared to previous nearly 1000. That shows Dow Jones might going to be stabilize already.
For Crude Brent Oil, I don't think Brent will break USD 40. Normally, during USA Presidential Election, Brent will move within a band of USD 20 per barrel. Thus, assuming the support level for Brent Oil is USD 40-45, thus, beyond June until December 2020, the Brent Oil will have tendency to test USD 60-65 per barrel. That's consider V Shape recovery.
I hope Dow Jones will follow 2018 trend and not 2008. They just loss in 16 trading days in 2018 which if we calculated the period is over. Pray for the best. Dow Jones set the tune. Hopefully they will push back to 27000 level and above..

One thing that we need is for the market to recover in V SHAPE mode. Than it will be something. If the recovery is slumber land..we will be in trouble...but historically if we compare to SARS..the recovery was so fantastic..it was V SHAPE recovery..
Currently, COVID 19 is about media headlines only..once the media change the mode to positive news such as vaccine found , China successfully contain the virus , USA successfully contain the virus , Europe successfully contain the virus then on top of all interest rate cuts aggressively by Federal Reserve mid March 2020, then market start to change its gear for positive mode.
Latest we can see Friday Dow Jones only loss 300 points compared to previous nearly 1000. That shows Dow Jones might going to be stabilize already.
For Crude Brent Oil, I don't think Brent will break USD 40. Normally, during USA Presidential Election, Brent will move within a band of USD 20 per barrel. Thus, assuming the support level for Brent Oil is USD 40-45, thus, beyond June until December 2020, the Brent Oil will have tendency to test USD 60-65 per barrel. That's consider V Shape recovery.
I hope Dow Jones will follow 2018 trend and not 2008. They just loss in 16 trading days in 2018 which if we calculated the period is over. Pray for the best. Dow Jones set the tune. Hopefully they will push back to 27000 level and above.."

By Nick Cunningham - Mar 10, 2020, 8:00 PM CDT
https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/US-Shale-Collapse-Will-Lead-To-...
U.S. shale growth is about to decline, becoming an immediate victim of the Saudi-Russian price war.
Saudi Aramco said that it would increase oil production to 12.3 million barrels per day (mb/d) in April, a shocking escalation of the war for market share. That level of output is believed to be beyond what Aramco can produce on a sustainable basis. In other words, Saudi Arabia is going all-out to flood the market.
Also, Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman didn’t sound interested in meeting with Russia anytime soon. “I fail to see the wisdom for holding meetings in May-June that would only demonstrate our failure in attending to what we should have done in a crisis like this and taking the necessary measures,” Prince Abdulaziz told Reuters.
According to Energy Intelligence, Saudi Arabia is conducting budgeting exercises to game out scenarios in which oil crashes to between $12 to $20 per barrel, and will even look at an extreme scenario in which oil falls below $10.
Russia says it can withstand the price war at $25 to $30 per barrel for 6 to 10 years. Neither side appears willing to budge.
“Monday will go down as one of the bleakest market days in the history of the energy sector,” Raymond James wrote in a note. “Was this capitulation day? It certainly feels like it... it is hard to imagine how much worse sentiment can get.”
Related: Russia Fires Back: Could Boost Oil Production By 500,000 Bpd
As a result, the immediate victim will be U.S. shale. “[O]il should bottom out when producers begin physically shutting in wells, which is indeed what set the floor four years ago,” the investment bank added.
The reaction was swift. With share prices in freefall, the number of shale companies announcing budget cuts multiplied at the start of the week. Diamondback Energy and Parsley Energy immediately announced plans to cut spending and reduce drilling activity.
Canadian oil company Cenovus Energy slashed 2020 capex by 32 percent and its production guidance by 5 percent. Ovintiv said it would cut spending and tried to reassure skittish investors that it had enough liquidity. Marathon Oil cut spending by $500 million.
Even Chevron admitted that it might need to cut spending, just days after it unveiled lofty goals on free cash flow over the next five years. “We are reviewing alternatives to reduce capital expenditures, that are expected to lower short-term production and preserve long-term value,” Chevron said in a statement to Reuters late on Monday. Chevron was the first oil major to suggest that it might cut spending, and the oil giant said that it needs $55 per barrel in order to cover its spending and shareholder payouts.
At these prices almost no shale well drilled today can make money. Rystad Energy says just a handful of companies have breakevens lower than today’s oil price. Friezo Loughrey of data firm Oil Well Partners LLC told Bloomberg that Permian breakevens are closer to $68 per barrel if investors want an adequate return within 24 months. Today, prices are trading at half of that.
Related: Saudi Arabia's Archenemy Is Taking Advantage Of The Oil War
“Many US fracking companies already had their backs to the wall before the price slump due to high debts and financing difficulties,” Commerzbank wrote in a note. “Drilling activity declined continuously until mid-January, and has since stagnated at a low level.”
The one-two combo of the coronavirus pandemic and the Saudi-Russia price war could deliver a knockout blow to U.S. shale.
But perspectives on the impact on production vary. JBC Energy said that they “prefer a more cautious call on US supply declines,” adding that it may take a few months before production begins to fall.
But others see an immediate retreat. “A decline in US shale oil production of 1-2m bl/day from current total US oil production of 13.1m bl/day is natural to expect,” Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB, said in a statement. “We now think that a last-minute deal between Russia and OPEC before the expiry of the current cuts at the end of March 2020 is very unlikely. Russia has probably firmly decided that now is the time to pull away the rug from under the feet of the shale oil producers, so now is the time for the second shale oil reset.”

At the price of US$48 per barrel for oil, Malaysia stands to have RM4.5bil shaved off from its oil revenue. And should the prices plummet to the range of US$20 to US$25 per barrel, the additional losses would be to the tune of between RM11.1bil and RM12.6bil.

Charlie Dear,
As explained earlier, it's still looking good. Thanks to our Russian connection, beside other Battleships that I shared earlier, over the last 2 days, I have been accumulating another 5 batches of Interceptor Serba Dinamik. My last collection was in early January 2020. The other 5 batches were collected before the Bonus Issues and Share Splits. Just like Icon, I have also been trading in Serba and applied the same principle - buying on dip and sell when it's on momentum
With this latest accumulation, my Interceptor Serba Dinamik has fallen from P1 to P2 in term of margin from my collections of Battleships.
What I did is to apply the Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule). In economics, the original observation was in connection with population and wealth. Pareto noticed that approximately 80% of Italy's land was owned by 20% of the population. He then carried out surveys on a variety of other countries and found to his surprise that a similar distribution applied.
I have applied this principle when investing in my collection of battleships, the 80-20 rule maintains that 80% of outcomes (outputs) come from 20% of causes (inputs). In the 80-20 rule, you prioritize the 20% of factors that will produce the best results.
Thanks for asking. It's a nice feeling when someone is in love with you..
Take care
Meow.."

Worst Dow drop since 1987, and only -10% because of the circuit breakers that were put to deal with 1987-style plunges. If it weren't for these, I have a feeling 1987 would be second to 2020.
During this week I have invested in great companies at good prices— when they are out-of-favor—dream of times like these. They don't come around very often, but when they do it's time to buy and shout gleefully that you are fortunate enough to live in times when stocks are selling at fire sale prices.
This time, I’m not selling, I will stay on course, everything will be alright by the next 18 months. Recovery by end of this year will be an added bonus.
I've had more fun this week since I entered the market right after GE14. It's all been pretty amazing and fascinating. Now, I will sit back and let the management teams of these companies do what they do best: manage.
Remember: Volatility equals opportunity—not risk!
As shared earlier by the team...
Crude oil price has rebound ... Europe equities rebound ... US equities futures rebound ...
As at 7.27pm,
Nymex => 33.16 (+1.66) (+5.27%)
Brent => 35.01 (+1.79) (+5.39%)
Dow Jones Futures spike up to => 22,191.0 (+1106.0) (+5.25%) !

It's some individuals control the supply to make crude oil producers manage to survive. Those individuals suka2 can flood the market n send oil price tanked when they r in bad mood.

I suppose everyone have different views in making their respective investments. For me, it is easier if you invest on something that goes in line with the country’s direction and at the same time doing something that will benefits this Country as well as the Global community. I always has this rule of thumb when I made my investments. I do this as it will benefits the people surrounding me and also to the Global Community.
10 years from now as I look back, I want to feel that I was part of these success stories.
Currently the O&G sector has dropped from P2 to P6 from the 13 sectors. FYI, I have grouped all these 13 sectors into the above 4 Boutiques i.e. Plantation, O&G, Digital Economy and Visit Malaysia Year.
All these companies under these 4 Boutiques give me the pulse of our economy. Current performance in term of margin:
P1 - Plantation
P2 - Oil & Gas
P3 - Digital Economy
P4 - Visit Malaysia Year 2020
It’s just like an F1 Race between Mercedes Benz, Ferrari, Red Bulls and Maclaren.
My motivation for O&G Boutique:
20% of government revenue in 2020
50 Billion Petronas Capex
Each US$1 per barrel increase in oil prices brings the Treasury RM300 million in revenue per year.

Historically when Brent Oil reach bottom at USD 27.67 on 18th January 2016, it took only 102 days to touch USD 52.80 on 8th June 2016. While overall, it took 701 days to touch USD 86.74. Same goes with current situation. If history repeated itself, V Shape Recovery, within next 3 months, we will see Brent to double its price to USD 60..but who knows it will be more aggressive due to USA Presidential Election. Normally, the steepest it fall, it will bounce aggressively. Our closest Super Power is heading towards that direction..

I have released most of my holding in AAX at different interval. However, I'm still keeping 1000 shares as a token. I usually leave some tips on the table whenever I go for dining. It's my way of saying...THANK YOU!
Now waiting patiently to collect at 3 sen. The same applies to Air Asia..
It is the uncertainty in the market that brings volatility. However if you do it right, it can also be an excellent opportunity to be a profitable adventure. Based on my last battle cycle, my Armada has generated 3 Digits ROI with a very healthy margin.
With this success story, I'm actually looking forward to ride this 2nd wave. This time Armada will not be alone. She will be accompanied by her 12 other Battleships including Royal Fortune ICON. With my latest accumulation since last week, my Armada Fleets of 13 Battleships will be re enforced with Jet Fighters to fight this War on Terror..

Last week I collected another bathes as the price was too delicious to ignore. Personally now is the right time to sailang on O & G stocks. Oil price won’t forever stay at around USD $ 20 plus one. Beside, Global Recession will mainly impact on the not necessity items. Oil is the essential item. Those essential item will not be impacted even Global Recession.
Only buy with your excess fund and never on margin calls. If you have the patience, please continue to wait as you could get it as a much lower price. ICON will be put under Category 3 when all this fiasco are over..

I have released some of my holding in TDM at different interval. However, I'm still keeping 10,000 shares as a token. I usually leave some tips on the table whenever I go for dining. It's my way of saying...THANK YOU!
Fortunately TDM is very positive. Currently TDM is ranked No 7 in term of margin in my collection of 10 Plantation.
My motivation for keeping the Plantation
Export revenue RM 67.6 billion (6.1% GDP)
Feeding more than 3 billion people over 200 countries.
B20 biodiesel for the transport sector by end-2020. Demand to increase palm oil by 500,000 tonnes per annum. Indonesia Petromina has mandated the use 3 million tons per annum
Currently Plantation is undergoing some correction. It's still my best performing Boutique. So I have no issues holding these Plantation.

Saudi Arabia is not backing down from the oil price war for market share, pledging another increase in its crude oil exports starting in May, despite a growing global glut amid crashing demand.
“[T]he Kingdom intends to increase its crude oil exports, starting from May, by about 600 thousand barrels per day, bringing the total of Saudi petroleum exports to 10.6 million barrels per day,” an official at the Saudi Arabian Energy Ministry said on Monday, as carried by the official Saudi Press Agency."

* US stocks fell sharply on Wednesday after President Donald Trump told the country to brace for a ""very, very painful two weeks"" amid the coronavirus pandemic.
* The White House projected that the US could see 100,000 to 240,000 deaths from COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.

US stocks fell Wednesday after President Donald Trump issued a dire new warning about pain ahead due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Trump told Americans to brace for a ""very, very painful two weeks"" during a press briefing Tuesday evening, adding ""this is going to be three weeks like we've never seen before.""
The White House is now projecting that the US could see between 100,000 and 240,000 deaths from the coronavirus pandemic, peaking over the next two weeks. Right now, the US has 189,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, currently the largest outbreak in the world. As of April 1, 4,000 have died of coronavirus in the US.
Here's where major US indexes stood at the 4 p.m. ET market close on Wednesday:
* S&P 500: 2,470.50, down 4.4%
* Dow Jones industrial average: 20,943.51, down 4.4% (974 points)
* Nasdaq composite: 7,360.58, down 4.4%
Investor sentiment is falling as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic is ""maybe starting to hit home for people that had been hoping for better news,"" Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told Markets Insider in an interview.
The losses came after the Dow Jones industrial average posted its worst-ever quarterly performance on Tuesday, slipping more than 23%. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 also posted their worst monthly returns since the depth of the financial crisis in October 2008, falling 14% and 13% in March."

Closing summary: Trump sends oil prices rocketing and US jobless claims soar
Donald Trump sent oil markets into an unprecedented buying frenzy on Thursday afternoon, after tweeting that Saudi Arabia and Russia had reached a deal on production cuts.
Russia poured cold water on the details, saying there had been no deal, but it still put oil futures prices on track for the biggest daily rise ever. At the time of writing Brent crude futures prices had gained 22%.
Here are the other important developments from today:
* More than 6.6m Americans filed jobless claims last week, by far the largest number in history and an indication that unemployment could reach a record high. Economists said it was one of the starkest indications yet of the scale of the economic pain already inflicted on the US.
* In the UK, the experimental data from the Office for National Statistics said that a quarter of UK companies are already cutting staffing levels “in the short term” due to the coronavirus crisis.
* British Airways confirmed that it will cut capacity by 90% year-on-year for April and May and furlough 30,000 cabin crew.
* British Gas owner Centrica has joined the ranks of companies cancelling their dividends. It also announced £400m in spending cuts this morning.
* National Express cancelled all of its services across the UK.
And of course you can continue to follow all of our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.

* Oil prices surged as much as 35% on Thursday after President Donald Trump said he expected Saudi Arabia and Russia to reach a deal that could end their price war and likely mitigate a sharp price collapse.
* Trump said he spoke with leaders in both countries as global demand for oil continues to evaporate while much of the world is in lockdown.
* A Saudi Arabia-Russia pact is expected to scale back a supply surge that led to US oil tumbling to an 18-year low earlier this week.
* Watch oil trade live here.
Oil rallied sharply on Thursday after President Donald Trump said he expected Saudi Arabia and Russia to cut back on oil production to save the drowning oil and gas industry.
Brent crude oil jumped as much as 47%, to $36.29, while West Texas Intermediate crude rose 35%, to $27.39, at intrasession highs. The resource started rallying on Wednesday after Trump first signaled a potential agreement between Saudi Arabia and Russia.
Trump provided different volume estimates in separate tweets, first mentioning a cutback of about 10 million barrels and then suggesting it could be ""as high as 15 Million Barrels.""
Trump said on Wednesday that he believed a deal would be reached within days. Such a deal is expected to lower production and bring prices back up.
Trump also said he had invited American oil executives to the White House to discuss measures to aid the oil industry, which has been hurt by a slump in demand due to both the coronavirus outbreak and the price war.
The oil strategy meeting would include CEOs from Exxon, Chevron, Occidental Petroleum, Devon Energy, Phillips 66, and Energy Transfer Partners, as well as the former Continental Resources CEO Harold Hamm, according to CNBC."

US West Texas Intermediate crude surged as much as 13% to $28.56 per barrel after gaining 25% Thursday. International benchmark Brent crude jumped 17% to $34.91 per barrel at its Friday intraday highs, continuing the previous day's 21% gain.

Dow soars 1,600 points as growth rate of new coronavirus cases appears to slow

Stocks jumped on Monday, rebounding from sharp losses in the previous week, as the number of new coronavirus cases in the U.S. appeared to slow down.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1,627.46 points higher, or more than 7%, at 22,679.99. The S&P 500 gained 7% to close at 2,663.68 while the Nasdaq Composite surged 7.3% to 7,913.24. The major averages rallied to their session highs in the final minutes of the session, with the Dow briefly trading more than 1,700 points higher.
Boeing gained more than 19% to lead the Dow higher. Raytheon Technologies, American Express and Visa rose more than 11% each. The S&P 500 was led higher by the utilities, consumer discretionary and tech sectors, all of which closed more than 7% higher. Retail stocks such as Nordstrom, Kohl's and Macy's also rose sharply.
Investors were encouraged by data that shows a slowing in the number of daily U.S. coronavirus cases, although it is still early to determine a lasting trend. There were about 30,000 new cases on Thursday, 32,100 cases on Friday, 33,260 cases on Saturday, and then a slowing to just 28,200 new cases Sunday, according to the latest data from Johns Hopkins.
The Trump administration also noted on Sunday there are signs of stabilization in hospital rates, helping to lift Wall Street sentiment on Monday. Meanwhile, New York State reported 594 new coronavirus deaths on Sunday, fewer than 630 on Saturday, marking the first daily decline in coronavirus-related deaths.
""Incoming data suggests NY state might peak sooner than Cuomo's optimistic case,"" Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat, said in a note to clients. ""With better visibility on the healthcare crisis in the US, particularly, on a potential to model a national peak, we believe buyers are now taking control.""
Slowing death rates in Europe also offered up some hope that the U.S would be nearing its peak soon as well and that social distancing measures are working."

Crude oil prices were up on Wednesday as the upcoming meeting between OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, give hope to investors of potential support to prices.
International benchmark Brent crude was trading at $32.32 per barrel at 0620 GMT for a 1.4% increase after it closed Tuesday at $31.87 a barrel.
American benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was at $24.72 a barrel at the same time for a 4.6% gain after ending the previous day at $23.63 per barrel.
The oil producing member countries of OPEC+ will hold a teleconference on Thursday to discuss the low price environment and the supply-demand balance in the global oil market.
Due to the rapid spread of coronavirus, or the COVID-19 disease, weak economic activity around the world has lowered global oil demand, increasing the glut of supply in the market.
Saudi Arabia-led OPEC and Russia-spearheaded non-OPEC failed on March 6 to lower their collective output, causing a massive plummet in prices, which fell on March 30 to their lowest level since 2002.
The OPEC+ group is estimated on Thursday to lower their collective oil production level by between 10-15 million barrels per day in order to trim some of the oversupply."

“The meeting will undoubtably be fruitful in order to rebalance the market through measures we will take tomorrow,” Mohamed Arkab, OPEC’s President and Algeria’s Energy Minister told state news agency APS, according to Reuters.
While an intangible statement, the optimistic words spoken by the OPEC President seem to be just what the doctor ordered for the volatile markets as speculators try to make the most out of the oil-price plunge.
As a result of today’s spike, trading of the biggest oil ETF, the United States Oil Fund (USO), had been halted temporarily. Trading of the USO has since resumed. The USO is trading up 4.03% as of 3:03pm EDT.
All eyes remain on the potential deal that OPEC group may come up with tomorrow in what could be the largest oil production cut deal ever. Signatories to the deal could include, in addition to OPEC, Brazil, Norway, Canada, and all the OPEC+ countries that signed onto the previous deal. While some are hoping that the United States may join in the cuts, a formal agreement between the US and other oil producers appears unlikely.
Saudi Arabia and Russia, together responsible for producing more than 22 million barrels per day, are expected to make or break the chances of a production cut deal.
A 10 million bpd figure has been discussed by meeting attendees in the run-up to the meeting, although that figure would be insufficient to offset the loss in oil demand that the market has seen due to the coronavirus.

Oil prices jumped after Reuters reported that the two countries have agreed to a ""deep cut"" in crude production.
OPEC and other oil producers were set to debate on Thursday oil cuts as big as 20 million barrels per day (bpd), equivalent to about 20 percent of global supplies, one OPEC source and a Russian source told Reuters.
""That is a global deal,"" the OPEC source said.
He did not specify if the United States would be involved - something Russia and OPEC producers have insisted on.
A worldwide lockdown to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic has cut fuel demand by roughly 30 percent and contributed to a crash in prices that took major benchmarks down by more than two-thirds.
Prices surge
Prices surged over 10 percent earlier on Thursday as producers appeared set to cut production sharply, but the exact details of the cuts remain unclear.
The OPEC and allies including Russia - a group known as OPEC+ - were in talks on Thursday to cut production sharply, with numbers as high as 20 million bpd bandied about, OPEC and Russian sources said.
That would be equivalent to about 20 percent of global supplies, to support prices hammered by the coronavirus crisis. However, it is unclear if a figure that lofty includes cuts made for economic decisions by private producers in the United States, Canada and elsewhere, or if OPEC assumes those countries will mandate cuts, which the US has not wanted to do.
A cut of 20 million bpd would be by far the biggest output cut ever agreed by OPEC. But Russia has insisted it will only reduce output if the United States joins the deal. US laws prevent coordination among private companies.
Analysts, meanwhile, said that even if such record cuts are agreed, they will not be enough.
""Ultimately, the size of the demand shock is simply too large for a coordinated supply cut,"" analysts at Goldman Sachs said on Thursday.
Following the OPEC+ meeting, energy ministers from the Group of 20 major economies are set to meet on Friday.
The last OPEC meeting in early March ended acrimoniously, with Russia and Saudi Arabia unable to come to an agreement to curb output as the virus spread, adding to the slump in prices.
A source briefed on Saudi Arabia's oil policy said it is ready to cut up to 4 million bpd of its production, but only from its record output levels of 12.3 million bpd achieved in April.
Russia has said it wants output to be cut from the January-March levels before Saudi production jumped."

The group said it would cut output in May and June by 10 million barrels to help prop up prices. The cuts will then be eased gradually until April 2022.
Opec+, made up of Opec producers and allies including Russia, held talks on Thursday via video conference.
Talks were complicated by disagreements between Russia and Saudi Arabia.
The group and its allies agreed to cut 10 million barrels a day or 10% of global supplies. Another 5 million barrels is expected to be cut by other nations.
It said the cuts would be eased to eight million barrels a day between July and December. Then they would be eased again to six million barrels between January 2021 and April 2022.
Oil prices slumped in March after Opec+ failed to agree cuts .
In the wake of the March meeting, Saudi Arabia and Russia moved to boost production in order to retain market share amid falling global demand.
That, together with the collapse in demand for oil amid the coronavirus pandemic, help to push oil prices to 18-year lows by the end of March.
Prices have recovered some ground since then. Last week, prices jumped 20% after US President Donald Trump said he expected Saudi Arabia and Russia to end their feud.
Thursday's talks will be followed by a conference call on Friday between energy ministers from the G20 countries. It will be hosted by Saudi Arabia.
Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia's wealth fund and one of Moscow's top oil negotiators told Reuters: ""We are expecting other producers outside the Opec+ club to join the measures, which might happen tomorrow during G20.""
The US has not committed itself to any cuts although it did say that its oil output was gradually reducing anyway due to plunging oil prices.
President Donald Trump had warned Saudi Arabia that the US would impose sanctions if it did not cut oil production."

April 22, 2020 8:09 pm by Myles McCormick and Joe Rennison in London, Hudson Lockett in Hong Kong and Matthew Rocco in New York
Brent bounces back from two-decade low after US president takes aim at Iranian vessels
Oil prices rebounded on Wednesday after Donald Trump stoked Middle East tensions, saying that he had ordered US warships to “shoot down and destroy” Iranian vessels if they posed a threat.
The US president’s intervention sent Brent crude back above $20 a barrel after the international benchmark had tumbled to its lowest level since 1999 on concerns over the collapse in global oil demand.
The declaration from Mr Trump also helped buoy the high-yield bond market, which is heavily exposed to the fate of energy companies. BlackRock’s iShare high-yield bond exchange traded fund, known by its ticker HYG, rose 1 per cent, having dipped 1.8 per cent on Tuesday.
“I have instructed the United States Navy to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea,” Mr Trump wrote in a tweet.
The prospect of renewed tensions in the Middle East gave crude a lift during a week where prices have struggled to contend with an evaporation in demand triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.
Brent rose as high as $22.45 a barrel and settled at $20.37, up more than 5 per cent on the day. The energy sector helped lead a rally on Wall Street that sent the benchmark S&P 500 up 2.3 per cent following two days of falls. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed up 2.8 per cent.
West Texas Intermediate, the US marker, rose 19 per cent to $13.78 a barrel. It almost halved during the previous session and earlier in the week fell into negative territory for the first time as producers were forced to pay buyers to take oil off their hands ahead of the expiry of futures contracts.
Brent crude remains down about 27 per cent so far this week. Oil production levels have remained robust even as the virus destroys demand, creating a supply glut. An unprecedented cut of almost 10 per cent of global supply by Opec and its allies will take effect next month, but traders worry it is not enough to offset the collapse in consumption.
The head of the International Energy Agency on Tuesday called for the output reductions to be expedited and deepened. Opec members met by phone overnight, but there was no sign they would change their plans."

By Mark DeCambre
Published: May 7, 2020 9:14 am ET
https://www.google.com.my/amp/s/www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/guid/284...
Brent oil price, the international benchmark, rises around 6%
Crude oil futures climbed sharply on Thursday, at least partly supported by Saudi Arabia’s decision to lift prices to help stabilize values, while China’s appetite for the commodity picked up in April compared with prior months.
Saudi Arabia, the most influential member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is raising crude prices for its customers world-wide, according to Bloomberg TV.
Meanwhile, China’s imports rose to 10.42 million barrels a day in April from 9.68 million in March, according to Reuters data. Overall imports for the world’s second-largest economy and the biggest oil importer were down 14.2% from the year-ago period. However, exports from the country grew an unexpected 3.5% from the previous year.
That data combined with hope of a slowdown in production by global oil producers and a gradual revival of economies around the globe after restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic are lifted are expected to eventually lift crude prices.
“Oil is ruining up on hopes on rebounding demand,” wrote Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in a daily research note.
West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery CL CLM20+9.38% on the New York Mercantile Exchange, rose $2, or 8.3%, to $25.99 a barrel, after settling 2.4% lower on Wednesday, which snapped a five-session streak of gains.
Global benchmark July Brent crude UK:BRNN20+5.99% picked up $1.54, or 5.2%, at $31.26 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe, following a 4% decline in the prior session."
"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800003587.jsp?ftp=173","May 7, 2020 9:53 PM","tkl88","The EIA reported Wednesday that U.S. crude inventories rose 4.6 million barrels for the week ended May 1. The data, which excludes changes in the SPR, marked a 15th consecutive weekly rise, but was smaller than the average increase of 7.1 million barrels forecast by analysts polled by S&P Global Platts.
Investors are also digesting the U.S. weekly jobless claims data Thursday which showed more than 3 million Americans lost employment, adding to the already 30 million figure that has been racked up over the past six weeks.
Some signs of easing tensions between China and the U.S. may also be providing a lift to crude prices, as Bloomberg News reported on Thursday that U.S. trade negotiator Robert Lightihizer and his counterpart Liu He are scheduled to have a call to discuss progress on a phase-one trade deal between the countries that had looked in jeopardy of being quashed by President Donald Trump."

一个月前卖不动，如今国际原油或将供应短缺！怎么回事？

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800003587.jsp?ftp=173","May 9, 2020 4:27 PM","tkl88","4月中旬，纽约油价惊现负值，让无数人陷入“投资扣光本金还要倒贴钱”的尴尬境地。我们刚刚被科普出现“负油价”的原因是，国际油市供应过剩。然而，不到一个月时间，有分析师就却指出，有迹象显示，国际原油市场可能很快就要从供应过剩，转为供应短缺。这到底是怎么一回事呢？
首先，我们可以从与国际原油市场关系最为密切的油轮收益情况中了解到当前乃至未来原油的供应情况。据国际航运新闻网最新报道，波罗的海国际航运公会（BIMCO）首席航运分析师指出，2020年第一季度，是近十年来大型油轮收益最高的季度之一。这主要是由于一季度油价暴跌，市场比较倾向于囤积原油，待价而沽，可囤油的油轮租金及运价就应声上涨。
据国际航运新闻网（International Shipping News）5月7日消息，近几周，全球原油油轮收益呈大幅下降趋势。短短九天内（4月22日-5月4日），从中东湾到美国湾的超大型油轮的收益就从16.24万美元/天，大跌至3.62万美元/天，降幅近八成。反证可得，这一信号可能意味着国际油市已经逐渐倾向于将原油取出使用，供应也很可能也将不再过剩。
此外，随着欧佩克（OPEC）的减产协议5月开始生效，国际油市逐渐从期货溢价（远期期货价格高于近期期货）向现货溢价（现货价格高于期货价格）转变。而国际原油市场的现货溢价鼓励投资者将石油从库存中取出使用。
此外，中国、美国等多个国家开始复工，也消耗库存原油，进一步提振了国际原油需求。据Market Watch最新公布的报告显示，近几天，由于美国能源部门连续两天抽走汽油库存，美国汽油需求在四周内又创新高。
而中国复工步伐的稳步推进，也将进一步推高原油需求。目前，中国炼化厂的生产已经恢复了70%的产能。而据美国能源情报集团（Energy Intelligence）预测，二季度，中国的能源需求将环比增长100万桶/日，增幅约为10%。"

Chinese Oil Demand Is Almost Back to Pre-Virus Crisis Levels
Stock Markets3 hours ago (May 18, 2020 07:36AM ET)
(Bloomberg) -- Chinese oil demand is all but back to levels last seen before Beijing imposed a national lockdown to fight the coronavirus outbreak, according to people with inside knowledge of the country’s energy industry.
China is the world’s second largest oil consumer, behind only the U.S., and the country’s quick turnaround has helped tighten the petroleum market sooner-than-expected. West Texas Intermediate crude, which a month ago plunged into negative prices, surged on Monday above $30 a barrel.
“China’s oil demand is starting to show optimistic signs of full recovery, led by diesel,” said Liu Yuntao, a London-based analyst with consultant Energy Aspects."

TheEdge Mon, May 18, 2020 04:00pm - 6 hours ago
The plan
In a nutshell, the unitholders of the trust will be shareholders of OSV companies, financial institutions and banks, as well as Permodalan Nasional Bhd (PNB).
Apart from Petronas, PNB has the most significant exposure to the oil and gas sector. Based on its annual report, PNB and its related companies have equity interest of 60.18% in Velesto Energy Bhd, 38.21% in Sapura Energy Bhd, 12.82% in Bumi Armada Bhd, 10.11% in Petronas Gas Bhd, 8.27% in Petronas Dagangan Bhd, 7.9% in Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd, almost 6.5% in MISC Bhd and 6.36% in Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd, among others.
Another state-controlled entity, Icon Offshore Bhd, which is 42.57% controlled by Yayasan Ekuiti Nasional (Ekuinas), has 32 OSVs. Other large OSV players include Alam Maritim Resources Bhd, which has 39 vessels, according to its website, and Perdana Petroleum Bhd, which has 16 vessels and is 60.48% controlled by Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd. There are also other large companies such as floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) player, Yinson Holdings Bhd, which has four offshore support vessels that are largely for its own use.
Petronas went on to highlight a proposal to build new OSVs to the tune of RM3.4 billion, with charter rates for all vessels to reach RM3.5 million a day or a little above RM1.2 billion a year."

Due to present euphoria, many investors are chasing O&G counters especially those darling stocks without realizing the dangers ahead. Technical profit taking is inevitable under this present scenario.
ICON (5255) has good fundamentals no doubt. But the chart technicalies is nothing to shout about.
Sorry if I offended anyone here but what you see is what you get.
Happy trading⛽⛽⛽"

WTI crude oil has been pretty much on a one-way path since bottoming in late April, but the path could get bumpier soon as confluent resistance stands in the way of the advance over the 40-mark >>> Refer to my last posting.
Oil is currently trading inside the March 9 Saudi gap that shook financial markets when they were already reeling from the coronavirus.
The gap is a rather significant hole that leaves a little more room to go before it is filled up to 41.51.
Not too far beyond that point is the June 2017 and December 2018 lows that are in almost exact alignment at 42.27/42.67, respectively. It appears likely there will be some kind of fight that develops around the 41.51/42.67 zone. It could come as quick as this week, but perhaps it takes a little longer if oil slows its roll until reaching for resistance.
From a tactical standpoint, fresh Longs don’t appear to hold good risk/reward while Shorts are still risky with oil trending higher and no significant resistance yet at hand.
That could soon change, where existing Longs are at risk of a decline developing, while Shorts gain the upper hand off resistance.
Obviously, Crude Oil Futures had intruded into a Resistance Zone. Profit takings are inevitable.
Good luck guys ;)"

Other than that everything look lean after debt restructuring and taking big hit on asset impairment in prev Q resulting operational cost reduction in the following and coming Qs. At this point I am positive Icon would register decent profit in coming Q instead of loss. I'll keep digging."

What worried me now is how much Msia crude oil 136k prd cuts on May and June affecting Icon's osv earning since about 70% income generated from local ops, I believe it's concerning. Moreover, large portion of last quarter earning was from the on-off debt restructuring exercise which we won't see again in coming Q. Without that it could've registered lower profit from prev Q. *sigh*. I probably won't sleep well in the until next news."

The loss would not significantly impact the current price since it is already heavily undervalued based on Q4 EPS at 0.63 cents (2.52 cent annualized) when they begin to be back in black. Using this figure, current price is only at 4x PE ratio when industry PE is around 25x. This is about 21x undervalued. When pandemic comes to an end, its price would highly probable to shoot up way over the roof top."

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800003587.jsp?ftp=192","Sep 18, 2020 7:10 AM","tkl88","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose more than 2% on Thursday, turning positive as OPEC and its allies said the producer group would crack down on countries that failed to comply with output cuts and planned to hold an extraordinary meeting in October if oil markets weaken further.
After falling early in the session amid bearish jobs numbers and a ramp up in Gulf of Mexico oil output following Hurricane Sally, crude benchmarks reversed course to gain on the day, bolstered by comments from OPEC.
""Although no amendments to the current supply-cut deal have been proposed by OPEC+ today, the producers group gave the impression that it does not sweep troubles under the carpet,"" said Rystad Energy's Head of Oil Markets, Bjornar Tonhaugen.
Brent oil futures extended gains to settle up $1.08 or 2.56% at $43.30 a barrel. U.S. crude futures settled higher by 81 cents, or 2.02% at $40.97 a barrel. Both contracts rose more than 4% on Wednesday.
The panel of major producers, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, did not recommend any changes to their current output reduction target of 7.7 million barrels per day (bpd), or around 8% of global demand, according to a draft press release and an internal report.
The panel pressed laggards such as Iraq, Nigeria and the United Arab Emirates to cut more barrels to compensate for overproduction in May-July, while extending the compensation period from September to the end of December, according to three OPEC+ sources.
""They were coming down hard on the UAE,"" said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at Price Futures Group in New York. The expectation that output could fall as the UAE and others trim production bolstered prices, he said.
The OPEC news overshadowed the restart of U.S. offshore production after Hurricane Sally passed through the Gulf of Mexico and bearish U.S. economic news.
U.S. energy companies were starting to return crews to offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico after Sally halted operations for five days, shutting down nearly 500,000 bpd of output.
Prices were also under pressure from the slow economic recovery from the pandemic.
Global coronavirus cases are expected to pass 30 million on Thursday, according to a Reuters tally.
The U.S. Labor Department's report showed the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week, but remained at extremely high levels as the labor market recovery shifts into low gear and consumer spending cools.
Even OPEC+ cautioned that the pandemic could continue to curb demand. An OPEC+ technical panel warned that a rise in coronavirus cases in some countries may curb oil demand despite signs of economic recovery and initial indications of a decline in oil stocks, according to an internal document seen by Reuters."

By DALJIT DHESI
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2020/09/21/budget-20...
PETALING JAYA: Budget 2021, which will be tabled in November, will be expansionary though narrower than Budget 2020, with economists projecting a budget deficit of 4% to 6% next year.
The government, they said, would need to revitalise the economy with appropriate measures due to the uncertainties arising from the Covid-19 and the weak global economy, which has caused many nations to fall into recession.
The World Bank expects Malaysia’s fiscal deficit to gross domestic product (GDP) to widen to 7% this year, underpinned by increased expenditure and downward pressure on revenue. The government, however, expects the fiscal deficit to be at 5.8% to 6% this year.
Economists expect the government to look into some core areas to ensure Malaysia is on the right track to achieve economic sustainability post-pandemic.
Socio-Economic Research Centre executive director Lee Heng Guie told StarBiz that the federal government is torn between managing a tight fiscal space and keeping the country’s sovereign rating intact.
""In our view, the government should go for another year of fiscal deficit targeted at public spending and programmes as well as the provision of tax incentives and allowances to boost private investment, creating jobs and income."

Biden Wins Presidency, Ending Four Tumultuous Years Under Trump
https://www.google.com.my/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/11/07/us/politics...
By Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns
* Nov. 7, 2020 Updated 12:48 p.m. ET
Joseph R. Biden Jr. achieved victory offering a message of healing and unity. He will return to Washington facing a daunting set of crises.
Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. was elected the 46th president of the United States on Saturday, promising to restore political normalcy and a spirit of national unity to confront raging health and economic crises, and making Donald J. Trump a one-term president after four years of tumult in the White House.
Mr. Biden’s victory amounted to a repudiation of Mr. Trump by millions of voters exhausted with his divisive conduct and chaotic administration, and was delivered by an unlikely alliance of women, people of color, old and young voters and a sliver of disaffected Republicans. Mr. Trump is only the third elected president since World War II to lose re-election, and the first in more than a quarter-century.
The result also provided a history-making moment for Mr. Biden’s running mate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, who will become the first woman to serve as vice president.
With his triumph, Mr. Biden, who turns 78 later this month, fulfilled his decades-long ambition in his third bid for the White House, becoming the oldest person elected president. A pillar of Washington who was first elected amid the Watergate scandal, and who prefers political consensus over combat, Mr. Biden will lead a nation and a Democratic Party that have become far more ideological since his arrival in the capital in 1973."

Alex Longley and Matthew Martin

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800003587.jsp?ftp=194","Nov 9, 2020 11:33 PM","tkl88","(Bloomberg) -- Oil in London jumped by the most since June as Pfizer Inc. reported a potential Covid-19 vaccine breakthrough.
Crude futures spiked following news the vaccine, being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech SE, prevented more than 90% of infections in a study of tens of thousands of volunteers.
Markets globally surged. WTI climbed more than 10% in New York, while global equities soared. It led to broader strength in the oil futures curve, with timespreads also moving sharply higher.
A vaccine “would be the most meaningful type of mitigator to the situation,” Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz Bin Salman said prior to the Pfizer announcement at a conference on Monday. “We’re still hopeful that vaccine is found and that vaccine or vaccines spread and hopefully mobility would be regained.”
Since Covid first emerged, oil markets have been steadily recovering from the biggest crash in consumption in a generation. Transport use in Asia has rebounded strongly, but the renewed resurgence of the virus in Europe has continued to weigh on demand in the region. The emergence of a vaccine would not only help regions suffering form renewed lockdowns, but could also help spur the return of aviation demand -- the hardest hit corner of the market.
The relief in the market was seen in the profits from turning crude into transport fuels. Gasoline cracks in the U.S. reached their highest since mid-October, while those in Europe also gained. Jet fuel was also gaining relative to the value of other transport fuels in Europe, Bloomberg fair value data show.
Prices had earlier rallied as Joe Biden declared victory in the U.S. presidential election and began preparations to navigate America’s pandemic-hit economy out of crisis, with potential shifts coming on a range of policies from fiscal stimulus to Iranian sanctions. At the same time, Saudi Arabia said that OPEC+ could extend oil cuts through 2022 as the group seeks to re-balance the glutted market."

Under the agreement, in force for an initial period of five years, the Southeast Asian nation will be given priority access to Covid-19 vaccines developed by China. Both will share knowledge and expertise and facilitate scientific and technological capabilities to advance vaccine development in their countries, Malaysia said in a joint ministerial statement.
Science, Technology and Innovation Minister Khairy Jamaluddin signed the agreement with his Chinese counterpart Wang Zhigang in a virtual ceremony.
Cooperation between Malaysia and China under the agreement would be supervised by a committee chaired by the foreign affairs ministers of both countries that was formed in October to address post-pandemic challenges.
""Both countries will also support the participation of their public and private sectors including universities, institutions, societies and organisations in joint collaborative projects,"" the Malaysian ministries said."

Towards the end of the session, Dewan Rakyat Speaker Datuk Azhar Azizan Harun asked for a show of hands of those for and against the budget, and decided that there were more Members of Parliament (MPs) who agreed with the budget, although Pokok Sena MP Datuk Mahfuz Omar interjected and motioned for a tally of the votes.
However, this required 15 MPs to support the call for a tally. Only 13 stood up in support of the tally, according to the Speaker.
“There are fewer than 15 people [supporting the call for a tally]. There are more voices [in agreement with the budget]. The bill will see its second reading now,” he said.
The wrap-up by the minister was a heated one as ruling and opposition MPs furiously interjected for clarifications of certain issues, including the expansion of the Employees Provident Fund's (EPF) i-Sinar facility to include those receiving pay cuts due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Subang MP Wong Chen claimed that the EPF’s inflows amount to no more than RM20 billion per year, and therefore could not cover the total increased allocation of RM70 billion for the i-Sinar facility.
“Where is the EPF going to find the extra RM50 billion? Are they going to sell their shareholdings in listed companies on Bursa Malaysia? If this hits the headlines tomorrow, we will have a big problem,” he said.
However, Tengku Zafrul clarified that the EPF is seeing inflows of RM80 billion per year, adding that the Ministry of Finance (MoF) had looked into the matter.
“I would like to correct the facts. We conducted a detailed analysis of this for over a week. Actually, the inflows are not RM20 billion, RM30 billion or RM40 billion. It is RM80 billion per year,” responded the minister.
Following that, Wong pointed out that withdrawals by contributors, amounting to RM40 billion to RM50 billion per year, had to be taken into account as well — before his microphone was muted by the Speaker.
The session quickly devolved into a shouting match among the MPs, which resulted in intermittent muting of the MPs’ microphones by a visibly irritated Speaker.
“This is embarrassing behaviour. We are debating on the budget and this is how we are behaving? The rakyat are watching all of us here!” he said.
Other points mentioned during Tengku Zafrul's speech included a reduction in allocation for the Special Affairs Department (JASA) to make way for increases in other allocations, although he did not elaborate.
On the various proposals for a further extension of the loan moratorium, he said all who are eligible — whether they are in the B40, M40 or T20 category — will be able to request for various forms of assistance, which also include reducing or rescheduling loan repayments, from their respective banks."

Nanyang Thu, Dec 24, 2020 12:14am - 8 hours ago
（吉隆坡23日讯）海事通用（M&G，5078，主板交通与物流股）在2021财年次季，转亏为盈5606万5000令吉，或每股7.75仙，去年同期净亏1214万9000令吉。
该公司今日向交易所报备，因为重组收益和较低的财务费用，促使净利上升。
在截至10月底的次季，营业额年跌13.27%至4756万5000令吉，因为冠病疫情冲击原油需求量所致。
在首半年，海事通用也是转盈4108万2000令吉，上财年同期净亏2058万2000令吉；营业额年跌5.07%，至1亿286万4000令吉。
执行主席拿督莫哈末阿兹兰指，石油需求下降预计将持续到明年下半年，或直到各种刺激措施及疫苗广泛使用并推动经济复苏为止。
“不过，大马及主要贸易伙伴如中国、日本和新加坡的经济逐步开放，及疫苗的积极进展，为油气上游与下游业务在明年捎来希望。”"

By INTAN FARHANA ZAINUL
Friday, 05 Feb 2021 11:57 AM MYT
https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2021/02/05/icon-offs...
PETALING JAYA: Icon Offshore Bhd is expected to be profitable this year driven by its million ringgits worth of contract for its newly acquired jack-up drilling rig.
Maybank IB Research estimated that Icon would turn profitable in the financial year 2021 from its rig’s ops, generating a net profit of US$6mil-US$8mil per annum, while its offshore support vessel (OSV) operation would lower lowers its losses on thanks to higher utilisation level at 62%.
“We are positive on Icon for securing a contract for its jack-up rig. We are positive that it would be the catalyst to turning its financials around,” it said in a report yesterday.
On Wednesday, Icon announced that it had secured a US$13.3mil (RM53.85mil) order to supply a jack-up drilling rig to Petrofac (Malaysia-PM304) Ltd, raising the group’s order book to RM768.8mil.
The duration of the contract is for 180 days or six months 6 months up to September 2021.
The project is for Icon's newly acquired jack-up rig that it bought from Perisai Petroleum Teknologi Bhd for US$42.54mil (RM177mil).
“We are positive, but not entirely surprised, by this development. Based on the contract value, it equates to a daily charter rate (DCR) of US$74,000, and as such appears to be above the prevailing market of US$68,000-US$70,000,” it said
It pointed out that that the contract tenure is shorter than that initially expected but would be in line, should Petrofac exercise the extension option.
Maybank IB remains it “buy” calls on Icon and expected that while the outlook is improving but the pace of recovery will be gradual, backed by its continuous efforts to optimise costs and OSV utilisation.
Merger and acquisition is a key catalyst to unlocking values, it added.
“OSVs DCR, utilisation and operating expenditure are Icon’s key earnings drivers. Variations in any of these parameters will impact profitability.
“Prolonged weakness in OSV utilisation and earnings expected would have a detrimental impact to its cash flows,” Maybank IB said."

16. PROSPECTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDING 31 DECEMBER 2021
The outlook of upstream exploration and production activities in Malaysia is expected to be positive this year
as compared to last year on the back of recovery of crude oil price. With the completion of the acquisition of
drilling business on 2 February 2021, the Group will have new revenue stream from drilling services in addition
to OSV charter hire income.
As a significant portion of the Group’s order book is long term (more than one year) in nature, this provides
cashflow stability and earnings visibility. The continued focus of the Group will be on operational efficiencies,
securing new contracts, maximising utilisation rate through competitive bidding for domestic and regional
contracts as well as leveraging on its continued presence in Brunei and maximising synergies between drilling
rig and OSV.
The Group’s Order Book stands at RM0.8 billion (equivalent to 3 years of revenue) and its Tender Book
amounts to RM0.3 billion. In view of this, the Board of Directors remain focused on improvement initiatives and
synergistic business opportunities."

Despite the recent sell-offs in oil, investors are warming up to the energy sector, which bore the brunt of last year’s shock of crashing oil prices and oil demand. The energy sector has been the top performer in the S&P 500 index year to date, despite the price routs last week and earlier this week.

Over the last 12 months, oil prices rose by over 70% — from around US$40 per barrel in mid-June 2020 to more than US$70 per barrel — due to optimism over the easing of Covid-19 restrictions for some of the world’s largest economies, it said....."

不过，他指出，有关宣布仅落实在成人疫苗接种率达50%的州属，而想要享有这些方便的人也必须得完成两剂疫苗的注射。期间，他就以巴生谷为例指出， 该区18岁以上的接种率已经达到64.7%， 因此可以获准重启11项经济活动。
他表示，届时，民众得出示数字证书，证明自己已经完成接种2剂疫苗。
“我再次提醒，完全接种的意思是注射第二剂双剂型疫苗后的 14 天，而单剂疫苗则是 28 天后才算完成。”
他也说，进一步详细指南，他将会在近期宣布。

KUALA LUMPUR (Sept 27): Bursa Malaysia’s Energy Index rose as much as 19.78 points or 2.78% to 731.32 this morning, becoming the top percentage gainer among bourse gauges, after oil prices hit three-year highs.
At 10.19am, the index, which tracks share prices of oil and gas (O&G) related companies, settled at 727.82, still up 16.28 points or 2.29%.
KNM Group Bhd, which was the most actively traded stock, gained as much as 2.5 sen or 10.87% to 25.5 sen.
At 10.19am, the counter had pared some gains at 25 sen, still up two sen or 8.7%, with 73.69 million shares traded.
Meanwhile, Bumi Armada Bhd increased by one sen or 2.27% to 45 sen; Perdana Petroleum Bhd grew half a sen or 4.35% to 12 sen.
Reuters reported that oil pushed past its July peaks as global output disruptions forced energy companies to pull large amounts of crude out of inventories, while a shortage of natural gas in Europe pushed costs up across the continent.
At the time of writing, Brent crude oil had added US$1.26 to US$79.35 (about RM332) a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude was US$1.21 higher at US$75.19.
""""Supply tightness continued to draw on inventories across all regions,"" ANZ Research said in a note quoted by Reuters.
Rising gas prices also helped drive oil higher as the liquid became relatively cheaper for power generation, ANZ analysts said in the note."

Oil settles above $81 with OPEC+ sticking to output increase
By Laura Sanicola
https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-falls-ahead-opec-supply-po...
Oct 4 (Reuters) - Oil jumped to a three-year peak on Monday after OPEC+ confirmed it would stick to its current output policy as demand for petroleum products rebounds, despite pressure from some countries for a bigger boost to production.
The producer club's decision to keep increasing oil output gradually sent prices sharply higher, adding to inflationary pressures that consuming nations fear will derail an economic recovery from the pandemic. read more
OPEC+ agreed in July to boost output by 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) each month until at least April 2022 to phase out 5.8 million bpd of existing production cuts.
Brent crude settled up $1.98, or 2.5%, to $81.26 a barrel. It rose 1.5% last week for a fourth consecutive weekly gain, and was back up to highs last seen in 2018.
U.S. oil settled up $1.74, or 2.3%, to $77.62 a barrel after gaining for the past six weeks, and was at its highest since 2014.
""Given the demand picture and the outcome of the OPEC meeting, the overall sentiment around crude is bullish,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.
Demand for coal and natural gas has exceeded pre-COVID-19 highs with oil closely trailing, according to energy watchdog, the International Energy Agency. Three-quarters of global energy demand is still met by fossil fuels, with less than a fifth by non-nuclear renewables.
OPEC+, which groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies including Russia, has faced pressure from some countries to add back more barrels to the market as demand has recovered faster than expected in some parts of the world.
Four OPEC+ sources told Reuters recently that producers were considering boosting output by more than had already been agreed. read more
The oil price rally has also been fuelled by an even bigger increase in gas prices, which have spiked by 300%, prompting switching to fuel oil and other crude products to generate electricity and for other industrial needs."

The rest will be coming from our Plantation Bio Fuel and Malaysia is the 2nd Biggest Exporter of Palm Oil.
Crude palm oil (CPO) futures price rose to RM5,000 a tonne for the first time on Tuesday. Our palm oil exports is expected to grow by 39% m-o-m and 0.3% y-o-y in September 2021 to 1.62 million tonnes, likely due to higher exports to India, China and the EU (European Union)
Meanwhile Fossil Energy prices continue to surge to fresh records as renewed fears stoke panic of the worst shortage in decades. India has warned it has only four days of coal reserves left, German power plants are running out of fuel and China just unloaded an Australian coal shipment despite an import ban and icy relations. Supply is just not there as economies rebound from a pandemic-induced lull, while problems like logistical logjams and transport bottlenecks are adding to the pressure.
Bigger picture: OPEC+ didn't come to the rescue yesterday as the group decided to continue its original plan of gradually releasing 400,000 additional barrels of oil per month. That's despite calls from world leaders, including the White House, to bring more crude on to the market and keep a lid on prices.
It's looking good guys from both Frontiers. Mabel Energy Battleships and Supertankers as well as Bio Fuel Plantation are cruising at full speed.

1. One of Malaysia’s largest OSV providers; dominant in AHTS and AWB with a relatively young fleet (7 years).
2. Vessels are Malaysia-flagged and will be able to capitalise on the stringent Malaysian cabotage rules.
3. Icon is going through a challenging macro environment, as it faces bottoming of DCR but gradual recovery of OSV utilisation.
4. Returns outlook is improving but the pace of recovery will be gradual, backed by its continuous efforts to optimise costs and OSV utilisation.
5. M&A action is a key catalyst to unlocking values
Upside
1. Resilient. Ahead of peers in cost management. More jobs expected with PETRONAS giving preference to local service providers over foreign-flagged vessels.
2. New management with commendable track record gives confidence to the market and eliminates past negative perception (corporate governance, cost management).
3. M&A action is not entirely ruled out as Government –owned Ekuinas, a 43% shareholder, aims to create values from a PE perspective.

"https://klse.i3investor.com/servlets/forum/800003587.jsp?ftp=213","Oct 22, 2021 7:07 AM","Mabel","Everyone who has been following oil markets during the pandemic knows that WTI crude prices reached negative levels in an unprecedented turn of events in April 2020.
The culprit back then was the overflowing Cushing storage hub.
In 2021, America's largest oil storage hub is once again about to play a crucial role in what could be the next major price shock in oil markets.
But this time, the opposite is true. Crude inventories in the crucial oil storage facility are plunging at an alarming rate.
According to JP Morgan, Cushing may just be weeks away from being ``effectively out of crude''
You see, a gas crisis in Europe and Asia has already led to a large, and unexpected jump in demand. This in combination with OPEC's overcompliance to its output cuts has created a very tight oil market
Without additional volumes, JP Morgan expects the Cushing hub to reach critical levels in the next two months, setting crude prices up for a serious spike.

9M21 results were in line with our expectations, on the back of stronger QoQ performance, driven by its drilling ops. The company is on track to meet our expectation amid a sequentially softer 4Q21, as seasonal weakness kicks in. SOP-based TP (unchanged) equates to 1x PBV, valuing the:
(i) JU ops at 0.6x EV/ replacement value (9 sen/shr) and
(ii) OSV ops at 0.7x PBV, (7 sen/shr).

Author: rakutentrade | Publish date: Wed, 17 Nov 2021, 12:34 PM
Icon Offshore (ICON) one is the largest offshore support vessel (OSV) provider in Malaysia and Southeast Asia in terms of number of OSVs. The operation of ICON is turning around in FY2021 on the back of higher utilisation rate; hence we expect the company to register net earnings of RM30.5m and RM45.3m for FY21 and FY22 respectively. BUY with a target price of RM0.17 based on a PER of 10x (Bursa Malaysia Small Cap Index average).
ICON owns and operates one of the youngest, fastest growing and most sophisticated fleets of OSVs in Southeast Asia. The Company provides a wide range of logistical support services throughout the entire offshore oil and gas life cycle, from exploration and appraisal, field development and operation and maintenance, through to decommissioning. ICON is a Malaysia-based OSV provider and all of the vessels are Malaysian-flagged.
The outlook of upstream exploration and production activities in Malaysia is expected to be positive this year as compared to last year on the back of recovery of crude oil price. Meanwhile the demand and utilisation for all rig classes in Asia Pacific is improving following the adverse events in 2020 due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic and oil price crash. Furthermore, PETRONAS remains committed to maximise its oil production as a cash generator and we see this as an opportunity for ICON.
ICON has a remaining order book amounting to RM770.6m as of September 2021, providing clear earnings visibility for the next 3 years. On top of that, the company’s current tender book stands at RM920.2m. ICON’s key priority for FY21 and beyond includes (i) cost optimisation; (ii) improve operation efficiency; and (iii) maximising utilisation rate. As such, the company’s 9MFY21 results have seen huge improvement in the bottom line as the company registered a core net profit of RM25m as compared to RM4.2m YoY due to better operational efficiency and higher utilisation rate.
We expect ICON to register net earnings of RM30.5m for FY21 despite the strong 9M results due to seasonal factor in 4QFY21. Meanwhile we expect FY22 earnings to grow by 48.2% to RM45.3m for FY22. Financial leverage is manageable with net gearing of 0.6x supported by a decent interest coverage ratio of 3.75x as of 9MFY21. Our BUY recommendation is premised on (i) its strong earnings visibility and growth potential underpinned by its RM770.6m outstanding orderbook; (ii) increasing utilisation rate as a result of recovery within the O&G sector post pandemic; and (iii) reasonable valuations.
